WSJ,11-Jul,"Trump's Son Hires Lawyer, Defends Meeting","President Donald Trump's eldest son retained a private attorney on Monday and said he would work with congressional investigators who have sought his testimony as part of ongoing probes into whether the president's campaign colluded with Moscow to influence the election.

Donald Trump Jr. has hired Alan Futerfas, a longtime criminal-defense attorney in New York who typically handles white-collar cases, a day after he said he arranged a meeting between top campaign aides and a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin who promised ""information helpful to the campaign.""

Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine), a senior member on the panel, called for the younger Mr. Trump and others involved in the meeting to testify.

""Our intelligence committee needs to interview him and others who attended the meeting,"" Ms. Collins said. Mr. Warner said he ""absolutely, absolutely"" wants to speak to the president's son, as well as the Azerbaijani pop star who asked for the meeting.

""Happy to work with the committee to pass on what I know,"" wrote Donald Trump Jr. on Twitter on Monday.

""Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent,"" he tweeted earlier. ""Went nowhere but had to listen.""

On Monday, the White House defended the meeting as standard practice. Mr. Trump and others who helped arrange the meeting -- which was also attended by then-senior campaign aides Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort -- described a complex series of events leading up to the June 9, 2016, conversation at Trump Tower in New York City.

In the spring of 2016, the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, approached Emin Agalarov, a singer who together with his father -- Azerbaijani-Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov -- helped sponsor the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, co-owned by President Trump. The younger Mr. Agalarov, who goes by just Emin in his professional capacity, asked his publicist, Rob Goldstone, to set up a meeting for Ms. Veselnitskaya with Donald Trump Jr.

""The lawyer had apparently stated she had some information regarding illegal campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee which she believed Mr. Trump Jr. might find important,"" Mr. Goldstone said in a statement Monday.

""I reached out to Donald Trump Jr. and he agreed to squeeze us into a very tight meeting schedule.""

In the meeting, Ms. Veselnitskaya briefly discussed alleged Russian contributions in the 2016 campaign before turning to the Magnitsky Act, a law targeting Russian human-rights abusers that she has campaigned against on behalf of her clients.

At that point, Mr. Trump cut off the meeting, according to both his account and that of Mr. Goldstone. Both men said there was no follow-up on the subject.

Ms. Veselnitskaya said in a statement Monday that she met with Donald Trump Jr. in her capacity as a private attorney.

""The purpose of my brief meeting with Mr. Trump Jr. was to explain the facts of my client's position,"" she said. She said she has also met with members of Congress to discuss the Magnitsky Act on behalf of her clients.

""I have never acted on behalf of the Russian government and have never discussed any of these matters with any representative of the Russian government,"" she said.

The White House cast the meeting as commonplace.

""I've been on several campaigns,"" and such a meeting would have been standard practice in any of them, spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. She said Donald Trump Jr. ""did not collude with anyone to influence"" the outcome of the election.

Both Ms. Veselnitskaya and the Agalarov family have longstanding ties to the Kremlin.

Ms. Veselnitskaya counts among her clients state-owned companies and relatives of top government officials. Her husband previously served as deputy transportation minister of the Moscow region.

The elder Mr. Agalarov's real-estate company has won several state contracts in Russia.

The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that President Vladimir Putin of Russia ordered a campaign to influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election in Mr. Trump's favor.

Mr. Putin has denied that the Russian government meddled in the U.S. election. Mr. Trump has denied that there was any collusion and has said he doubts the intelligence community's assessment, saying last week, ""No one really knows for sure.""

Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Mr. Putin, said Monday the Kremlin doesn't know Ms. Veselnitskaya. The Kremlin ""cannot keep track of every Russian lawyer and their meetings within the country or abroad,"" he said.

Did the Meeting

Cross a Legal Line?

Election-law experts say it is far from clear whether Donald Trump Jr.'s 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer crossed a legal line.

President Donald Trump's eldest son arranged a meeting in June of last year between top campaign aides and a Russian lawyer who has been linked to the Kremlin, after being told she ""might have information helpful to the campaign,"" according to a statement Mr. Trump Jr. issued on Sunday.

Federal election law prohibits foreign nationals or foreign governments from contributing or donating money or ""anything of value"" to a political campaign.

It also makes it a felony for a campaign or members of a campaign to knowingly and willfully solicit, accept or receive a donation or ""thing of value"" from a foreign national. The solicitation doesn't need to be successful in order to be illegal.

Prosecutions related to foreign-national donations have generally dealt with charges of funneling cash.

In theory, opposition research on a political foe could be considered something of value, particularly if the supplier of the information spent money to obtain it, according to legal experts.

But experts said it might be difficult to ascribe a value to a vague promise of damaging information about Hillary Clinton, which is how Mr. Trump Jr. described what he knew about the sit-down with the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya beforehand.

In a statement, Mr. Trump Jr. said that Ms. Veselnitskaya had done nothing helpful for the campaign and that he cut off the meeting after she dwelled on the Magnitsky Act, a federal law that placed sanctions on Russian human-rights abusers.

It is hard to draw any conclusions based on what is known about the circumstances of the meeting, said Kenneth A. Gross, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and a former Federal Election Commission lawyer.

""At best, the meeting might be grist for the mill for further inquiry, but that's about as far as we can go at this point,"" said Mr. Gross.

Mr. Trump Jr. said Sunday that he didn't know the lawyer's name before seeing her, making it unclear whether he knew she was a Russian national. If true, this could make it more difficult to prove criminal intent by Mr. Trump Jr."
WSJ,12-Jul,"
Keystone Kops Collusion","President Trump's critics claim to have uncovered proof, finally, of 2016 collusion between the campaign and the Kremlin. Another reading of the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a well-connected Russian lawyer is, well, political farce.

In June 2016, Mr. Trump Jr. arranged an appointment in Trump Tower with the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. He said in a statement that he hoped to acquire opposition research about Hillary Clinton, and he even pulled in Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and then campaign manager Paul Manafort. By Mr. Trump Jr.'s account, Ms. Veselnitskaya relayed nothing to compromise Mrs. Clinton and then lobbied him about the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 U.S. law that sanctions Russian human-rights abusers.

According to the emails that Mr. Trump Jr. released Tuesday, Mr. Trump Jr. agreed to meet with Ms. Veselnitskaya after he was approached by Rob Goldstone, a publicist who offered to pass along ""some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father."" He wrote that this information ""is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.""

The appropriate response from a political competent would have been to alert the FBI if a cut-out promised material supplied by a foreign government. Mr. Trump Jr. instead replied that ""if it's what you say I love it.""

Then again, the Trumps knew Mr. Goldstone through the Russian pop star Emin, aka Emin Agalarov, whose father partnered with Donald Trump Sr. in bringing the Miss Universe beauty pageant to Moscow in 2013. Mr. Trump Sr. appeared in a music video with Emin the same year. Mr. Goldstone said that ""Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting"" -- info his father got from the ""Crown prosecutor of Russia."" Russia's ""Crown prosecutor"" doesn't exist.

Mr. Trump Jr. responded that ""perhaps I just speak to Emin first."" Mr. Goldstone brokered the call, reporting that ""Ok he's on stage in Moscow but should be off within 20 Minutes so I am sure can call."" Subsequent messages show Emin asked Mr. Trump Jr. to meet with Ms. Veselnitskaya, who was well-known as an anti-Magnitsky operative at the time. Mr. Goldstone publicly checked into Trump Tower on Facebook during the meeting, which isn't how a KGB man would normally conceal the handoff of state secrets.

In the daisy chain from Russian oligarch to singer to PR go-between to lawyer to Trump scion, which is more plausible? That Don Jr. was canny enough to coordinate a global plot to rig the election but not canny enough to notice that this plot was detailed in his personal emails? Or that some Russians took advantage of a political naif named Trump in an unsuccessful bid to undermine the Magnitsky law they hated?

The problem is that President Trump has too often made the implausible plausible by undermining his own credibility on Russia. He's stocked his cabinet with Russia hawks but dallied with characters like the legendary Beltway bandit Mr. Manafort or the conspiratorialist Roger Stone. His Syrian bombing and energy policy are tough on Russia, but Mr. Trump thinks that if he says Russia interfered in 2016 he will play into the Democratic narrative that his victory is illegitimate.

Thus in retrospect the John Podesta and Democratic National Committee hacks -- still so far the tangible extent of Russian meddling -- did less damage to U.S. democracy than it has done to the Trump Presidency. The person who should be maddest about the Russian hacks is Mr. Trump."
WSJ,7/13/17,Trump Speaks in Son's Defense,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday sought to refute allegations that the Russian government tried to help his presidential campaign and damage that of Hillary Clinton, arguing that his policies run counter to the Kremlin's interests.

""There are many things that I do that are the exact opposite"" of what Russian President Vladimir Putin would want, Mr. Trump said in a television interview. ""So what I keep hearing about that he [Mr. Putin] would have rather had Trump, I think -- probably not.""

The comments to the Christian Broadcasting Network came a day after the president's son Donald Trump Jr. released documents showing he accepted a meeting to discuss an alleged Russian government offer of help damaging Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign. Donald Trump Jr. said the meeting was a waste of time and nothing came of it. He and two other senior campaign aides -- his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, then the campaign chairman -- met with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in New York last June.

Mr. Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that he didn't know of the meeting at the time and only learned about it in recent days. The president also defended his son: ""I think many people would have held that meeting,"" Mr. Trump said.

On Wednesday, Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he would be inviting Mr. Manafort to a hearing he is organizing on the issue of foreign lobbying and influence in the U.S. Mr. Grassley said Mr. Manafort's attendance at the meeting with the Russian lawyer would be a topic of conversation.

Earlier, President Trump, on Twitter, defended his son, praising an interview he did with Fox News. ""He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad.""

In his comments to CBN, the President suggested that Mr. Putin would have preferred that Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state and the Democratic nominee, win the 2016 election. Mr. Trump alleged her stances on military and energy policy would have been more helpful to Moscow.

The president's first six months in office have been dominated by investigations into possible collusion between Trump campaign aides and Russia during the election.

The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia interfered in the race, and was trying to tilt the election to favor Mr. Trump.

The Kremlin has denied meddling in the U.S. election, while Mr. Trump routinely dismisses the matter as a witch hunt and has suggested other countries besides Russia could have been behind the interference."
WSJ,7/12/17,U.K. Publicist Thrust Into Spotlight,"Rob Goldstone, a British-born publicist and music promoter who arranged a June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney allegedly linked to the Kremlin, is suddenly at the center of the investigation into Moscow's attempts to influence the U.S. election.

Mr. Goldstone has spent 13 years representing Emin Agalarov, an aspiring Russian pop star whose billionaire father, Aras, brought President Donald Trump's Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013. Mr. Trump even appeared in a music video with Emin.

Born in Britain, Mr. Goldstone studied as a journalist and ""worked for daily newspapers and radio stations in London,"" according to the website of his firm, Oui 2 Entertainment.

Mr. Goldstone founded Oui 2 with David Wilson in 1988 after years of work in the music marketing business. The company has partnered with EMI Music Publishing, Best Buy and the Friar's Club, according to its website.

By virtue of his work for the Agalarovs, Mr. Goldstone developed a relationship with the Trump organization. He first emailed Donald Trump Jr. on June 3, 2016, with hopes of setting up a meeting for Natalia Veselnitskaya, an attorney who is alleged to have close ties to President Vladimir Putin.

The meeting took place six days later. Mr. Goldstone ""checked in"" at Trump Tower on his Facebook page on June 9 just before the 4 p.m. meeting.

Mr. Goldstone referred all questions about his emails with the younger Mr. Trump to his attorney after their release Tuesday."
