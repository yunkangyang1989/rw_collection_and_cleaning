According to two officials who spoke anonymously with the New York Times, the incident involved possible sexual misconduct between Kavanaugh and the woman.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Member John N. Kennedy said on "Fox News Sunday" that the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings have devolved into an "intergalactic freakshow."\n\n"I\'m fairly confident that our Founding Fathers did not intend the process to work this way," the Louisiana Republican told Chris Wallace.\n\nKennedy said Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) "did the best he could" to keep order during hearings marred by Democrats "ignoring rules" and about 240 protests by the senator\'s count.\n\n"The only thing missing was the genitalia-shaped headgear," Kennedy said of protesters, referring to the pink hats donned by anti-Trump demonstrators during the women\'s marches.\n\nI joined @FoxNewsSunday to talk about the latest developments with Judge Kavanaugh.

"It\'s important that this is a through interview."\n\nCollins’ comments comes after The Washington Post published a story on Sunday revealing Ford’s name and more details of the alleged sexual assault that occurred when she and Kavanaugh were in high school.\n\nThe Maine lawmaker added that she could not answer questions regarding the veracity of Ford\'s accusations, but noted that if they prove true, Kavanaugh would be disqualified for the Supreme Court nomination.\n\n"I don’t know enough about Dr. Ford and her allegations to reach judgment of the allegations," Collins said. "Obviously if Kavanaugh has lied about what happened that would disqualify him."\n\nCollins spoke with Kavanaugh last Friday shortly after the then-anonymous allegations surfaced and said the federal judge denied ever assaulting any woman.\n\n"When I had my phone call with him last week he emphatically said he never had an encounter like this," she added.\n\nDemocrats and some Republican senators have expressed concern over Ford\'s accusation that a drunken Kavanaugh groped her and tried to take off her clothes at a party when both were teenagers in suburban Maryland.\n\nKavanaugh released a new statement Monday calling the allegation "completely false" and saying he "had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself" to The Washington Post.\n\n"I am willing to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee in any way the committee deems appropriate to refute this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity," Kavanaugh said.\n\nDebra Katz, the attorney for the accuser, said Ford was willing to tell her story publicly to the judiciary panel but no lawmakers had yet contacted her.

But Grassley said during a Tuesday radio interview that his office has reached out several times to Ford and her attorneys to discuss her allegation, but has heard nothing back.\n\n“We have reached out to her in the last 36 hours three or four times by email and we have not heard from them, and it kind of raises the question, do they want to come to the public hearing or not?” Grassley said on The Hugh Hewitt Show.\n\nAsked whether there would be a hearing if Ford did not agree to appear, Grassley suggested he couldn’t see a reason to hold one.\n\n“What would be the purpose of the hearing if Dr. Ford doesn’t want to respond?” Grassley said.\n\nTRUMP DEFENDS KAVANAUGH IN FIRST COMMENTS ON ALLEGATIONS\n\nFord declining to appear Monday wouldn\'t neccessarily automatically kill the hearing. Another member of the committee, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, said “I think so” when reporters asked Tuesday if Republicans would still have the hearing with Ford absent.\n\nIn the case Ford accepts the invitation, Grassley said he is considering the possibility of having an independent questioner ask all the questions to Ford.\n\nFord, a California-based professor, revealed her identity over the weekend in a Washington Post report. She said that Kavanaugh, while in high school, pinned her down, tried to remove her bathing suit and put his hand over her mouth when she attempted to scream. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation.\n\nThe announcement of the last-minute hearing evoked memories of the 1991 Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, where senators scrambled to arrange a hearing after Thomas was confronted with sexual harassment accusations by law professor Anita Hill. Thomas denied the accusations and was narrowly confirmed.\n\nDuring television appearances on Monday, Ford’s attorney, Debra Katz, indicated her client was “willing to take whatever it takes to get her story forth,” and would testify before the committee under oath. But Katz has not confirmed that Ford will show up for Monday’s open hearing, which would be aired live on television.\n\nSpeculation about whether Ford will ultimately accept the invitation follows reports she was reluctant to go public with her accusation after tipping off congressional Democrats.\n\nGrassley, announcing the Monday hearing, said it would "give these recent allegations a full airing."\n\nWhite House spokesman Raj Shah said Kavanaugh is willing to testify.\n\n“Judge Kavanaugh looks forward to a hearing where he can clear his name of this false allegation. He stands ready to testify tomorrow if the Senate is ready to hear him,” Shah said.\n\nDemocrats have called for delaying Kavanaugh’s vote until there is a full FBI review of the matter.\n\nBut Grassley told Hewitt on Tuesday that the FBI investigation “is closed” and that the FBI is not doing any further investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, Kavanaugh was spotted Tuesday arriving at the White House for meetings – as he did the day before.\n\nPresident Trump on Monday stood by Kavanaugh, calling him one of the “finest people that I have ever known” while acknowledging a "little delay" may be necessary before the nomination is voted on in the Senate.\n\nIn his first public comments on the controversy, the president also criticized Democrats over the timing of the allegation.\n\n“I wish the Democrats could have done this a lot sooner because they had this information for many months," Trump told reporters at the White House. "And they shouldn\'t have waited until literally the last days. They should have done it a lot sooner.”\n\nThe president said he’s open to delaying the confirmation proceedings in Congress while the allegations are investigated.\n\n"If it takes a little delay it\'ll take a little delay," Trump said.

Jeff Flake, who had said they wanted to hear from Ford before voting on Kavanaugh\'s confirmation, have indicated they would move forward with a vote if Ford chose not to testify.\n\nSen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., tweeted late Tuesday that Republican leadership "took immediate action" to ensure Ford and Kavanaugh could be heard.\n\n"If we don’t hear from both sides on Monday, let’s vote," he tweeted.\n\nRepublicans had repeatedly invited Ford and Kavanaugh to testify next week after delaying a planned Judiciary Committee vote that had been scheduled for Thursday. Kavanaugh accepted the committee\'s invitation, but Ford stayed mum until Tuesday night.\n\nFord\'s insistence on an FBI investigation, which a federal law enforcement official told Fox News was "totally inappropriate," throws the entire hearing into doubt: Grassley, R-Iowa, had threatened to nix the proceeding if Ford refused to participate.\n\nIt was also sure to add fuel to Republican claims that the allegations -- which were known to ranking Judiciary Committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein in July, but revealed to federal authorities just last Thursday -- are part of a concerted effort to stall Kavanaugh\'s nomination at the last minute.\n\n"While Dr. Ford’s life was being turned upside down, you and your staff scheduled a public hearing for her to testify at the same table as Judge Kavanaugh in front of two dozen U.S. Senators on national television to relive this traumatic and harrowing incident," Ford\'s attorneys wrote to Grassley.\n\nBut Republicans on the Judiciary Committee directly disputed that claim Tuesday night, writing in a statement that Ford had been offered a chance to testify privately, and had never been told she would need to sit near Kavanaugh. \n\nIn the letter, Ford\'s lawyers went on to assert that Ford\'s family "was forced to relocate out of their home" and that "her email has been hacked, and she has been impersonated online."\n\n"The hearing was scheduled for six short days from today and would include interrogation by Senators who appear to have made up their minds that she is \'mistaken\' and \'mixed up.\' While no sexual assault survivor should be subjected to such an ordeal, Dr. Ford wants to cooperate with the Committee and with law enforcement officials."\n\n\n\nThe lawyers, Debra Katz and Banks, said historical precedent supported the delay, echoing comments by Feinstein, who on Tuesday wrote on Twitter that the FBI had also "investigated Anita Hill’s allegations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas," the Supreme Court justice.\n\nHowever, Thomas was accused of sexually harassing Hill while both worked at federal agencies, in potential violation of federal law; Ford has accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment that would fall well outside of any applicable federal or state statute of limitations because the alleged episode occured decades ago.\n\nLAWYER DEBRA KATZ HAD DOWNPLAYED ALLEGATIONS OF SEX ASSAULT AGAINST CLINTON, FRANKEN\n\n"Now, I can\'t say everything\'s truthful. I don\'t know." — Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.\n\n"As the Judiciary Committee has recognized and done before, an FBI investigation of the incident should be the first step in addressing her allegations," the letter continued. "A full investigation by law enforcement officials will ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions."\n\nBut a federal law enforcement official told Fox News, "It\'s totally inappropriate for someone to demand we use law enforcement resources to investigate a 35-year-old allegation when she won\'t go under oath and can\'t remember key details including when or where it happened."\n\nBecause Ford\'s allegations do not involve any federal crime within the applicable statute of limitations, Fox News has learned that the bureau would require explicit instructions from the White House to conduct any additional probe.\n\n\n\nThe document concluded: "We would welcome the opportunity to talk with you and Ranking Member Feinstein to discuss reasonable steps as to how Dr. Ford can cooperate while also taking care of her own health and security."\n\nThe Judiciary Committee statement Tuesday night condemned any threats against Ford, but maintained that her request for an FBI probe was unfounded.\n\n"The FBI has indicated to the committee and in public statements that it considers the matter closed," Grassley and other top Republicans wrote. "The FBI does not make credibility determinations. The FBI provides information on a confidential basis in order for decision makers to determine an individual’s suitability. The Senate has the information it needs to follow up with witnesses and gather and assess the relevant evidence."\n\nThe Republicans also disputed the suggestion in Ford\'s letter that the committee had not been accommodating: "Contrary to suggestions by Dr. Ford’s attorneys, the committee had no plans to place Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh on a panel together, and never indicated plans to do so. Grassley’s staff offered Dr. Ford multiple dates as well as a choice of providing information in a public or private setting."\n\nMeanwhile, Feinstein and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer released statements backing Ford.\n\n"I agree with her 100 percent that the rushed process to hold a hearing on Monday has been unfair and is reminiscent of the treatment of Anita Hill," Feinstein said. "I also agree that we need the facts before senators—not staff or lawyers—speak to witnesses.\n\n"We should honor Dr. Blasey Ford’s wishes and delay this hearing," Feinstein continued. "A proper investigation must be completed, witnesses interviewed, evidence reviewed and all sides spoken to. Only then should the chairman set a hearing date."\n\nFEINSTEIN FACES GOP HEAT FOR SITTING ON KAVANAUGH ALLEGATIONS FOR WEEKS\n\nFeinstein had told Fox News earlier Tuesday that she could not be sure Ford was being entirely truthful.\n\n"This is a woman who has been profoundly impacted by this," Feinstein said. "Now, I can\'t say everything\'s truthful. I don\'t know."\n\nEric Holder, the former attorney general, tweeted late Tuesday that the FBI should do a "routine, normal inquiry concerning new Kavanaugh allegations. This is basic background investigation procedure."\n\nIn a separate statement, Schumer said an FBI probe would be consistent with "precedent," adding, "Dr. Ford’s call for the FBI to investigate... demonstrates her confidence that when all the facts are examined by an impartial investigation, her account will be further corroborated and confirmed."\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Judiciary Committee member Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., rejected a comparison to the Clarence Thomas episode.\n\n"You’re talking about history," Graham said. "We’re not looking back. We’re looking forward.”\n\nThe attorneys\' letter was yet another curveball in Kavanaugh\'s ongoing nomination drama, which began last week after a leak to The Intercept revealed that Feinstein was in possession of a supposedly damning letter relevant to his confirmation. Republicans have charged that Senate Democrats orchestrated that leak, which then prompted Feinstein to discuss the letter and its then-anonymous accusations publicly and with the FBI.\n\nFord went public on Sunday, alleging that Kavanaugh forced himself onto her and covered her mouth in the 1980s, when Kavanaugh was 17 and she was 15. Ford did not mention the incident to others by her own admission until 2012, according to The Washington Post, when her therapist recorded her claim that four individuals had committed the assault.\n\nFord has since claimed that the therapist incorrectly transcribed that detail, and that she had said there were only two people in the room. Her husband has maintained that Ford mentioned Kavanaugh in the therapy sessions.\n\nFord also told The Post she could not remember in whose house the alleged incident occurred, the exact month of the episode, or why there was a gathering there.\n\nRepublicans on Tuesday also reiterated Grassley\'s criticism of Feinstein for not telling Republicans, even privately, about the claims against Kavanaugh during days of private and public hearings on the nominee.\n\n"Ranking Member Feinstein first received a letter with allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh from Dr. Ford in July," the Republicans\' statement read. "However, Feinstein neglected to notify Committee Republicans of the letter until the day of the first Committee markup, six weeks after receiving the letter and well after the vetting and hearing process had concluded."\n\nThe statement concluded by charging that Feinstein had not taken the matter "seriously."\n\n"Feinstein referred the letter to the FBI, which added it to Kavanaugh’s background investigation file," it continued. "She should have treated these allegations seriously, as Grassley has done, in immediately acting upon hearing of them."\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a key potential swing vote senator, Arizona Republican Jeff Flake, said he would move to push Kavanaugh\'s nomination forward if Ford refused to show up to the hearing planned for Monday. Graham, R-S.C., has also said that if Ford refused to testify, the committee would move forward with a vote within the week.\n\nFox News\' Jake Gibson and Alex Pappas contributed to this report."

article_113 = 'The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday released a lightly redacted copy of the transcript of Monday’s conference call between Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and committee staff.\n\nThe call, conducted under threat of criminal penalty for lying, reveals an exasperated Kavanaugh countering accusation after accusation, likening his situation to an episode of The Twilight Zone.\n\nThe transcript reveals previously unknown details and one heretofore unrevealed accusation involving Kavanaugh and a man, suggested to be Mark Judge, sexually assaulting a woman on a boat off the coast of Newport, Rhode Island, in 1985, only to be confronted the next morning by two men who then severely beat Kavanaugh and Judge.\n\nThis new fifth accuser, according to the Senate Judiciary Committee staffer on the call, conveyed his allegations by telephone on Monday to Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). The staffer then read Whitehouse’s office’s report over the phone:\n\nSenator Whitehouse received a call this morning from a Rhode Island constituent, [REDACTED], who made allegations regarding U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. [REDACTED] reported that early on a Sunday morning in August of 1985, a close acquaintance of the constituent was sexually assaulted by two heavily inebriated men she referred to at the time as Brett and Mark. The event took place on a 36-foot maroon and white boat in the harbor at Newport, Rhode Island, after the three had met at a local bar. According to [REDACTED], when he learned of the assault at approximately 5:00 a.m. that same morning, he and another individual went to the harbor, located the boat the victim had described and physically confronted the two men, leaving them with significant injuries. [REDACTED] recently realized that one of the men was Brett Kavanaugh when he saw Kavanaugh’s high school yearbook photo on television over the weekend. He promptly reported the incident to our office on Monday morning, September 24, 2018.\n\nThe newest accuser’s name is left redacted in the transcript, but reporters quickly identified the Twitter account quoted in the same transcript as making repeated calls for the U.S. military to carry out a coup against President Donald Trump. The Twitter account belongs to a man named Jeffrey Catalan. As Fox News’s Alex Pfeiffer pointed out, the same account also suggested Donald Trump killed someone in 1983:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/PfeifferDC/status/1045096733926203392\n\nAs reporters began to swarm the Catalan account, it appeared to withdraw his claims of having beaten Kavanaugh up for raping someone, saying, “Do [sic] everyone who is going crazy about what I had said I have recanted because I have made a mistake and apologize for such mistake”:\n\nDo everyone who is going crazy about what I had said I have recanted because I have made a mistake and apologize for such mistake — Jeffrey Catalan (@JeffreyCatala16) September 26, 2018\n\nOn Monday, days before this apparent retraction, Kavanaugh categorically denied Catalan’s accusation, saying, “I was not in Newport, haven’t been on a boat in Newport. Not with Mark Judge on a boat, nor all those three things combined. This is just completely made up, or at least not me. I don’t know what they’re referring to.”\n\nAlso first unveiled in the transcript are new details of the fourth accusation, an anonymous letter alleging Kavanaugh “shoved” the writer’s daughter’s friend “up against the wall very aggressively and sexually” after leaving a bar together in 1998. The letter is revealed to have originated in Denver, Colorado. The unnamed daughter is supposedly from Boulder, Colorado. And Kavanaugh is said to have been “dating” the women he shoved.\n\n“[W]e’re dealing with an anonymous letter about an anonymous person and an anonymous friend. It’s ridiculous. Total twilight zone. And no, I’ve never done anything like that,” Kavanaugh responded.\n\nWhen a staffer asked Kavanaugh about dating the unnamed woman in the letter, Kavanaugh pointed out that the accusation provides nothing that could identify the woman in question in the following exchange:\n\nStaffer: While you were involved in the Starr investigation, do you recall ever dating a woman who would fairly fit the description in the letter provided to Senator [Cory] Gardner [(R-CO)]? The anonymous letter. Judge Kavanaugh: What’s the description? Staffer: Just based on what I — Judge Kavanaugh: Describe her appearance. Staffer: No, it’s — all we have is what I read. Judge Kavanaugh: Well, then I don’t know what I’m responding to then.\n\nIn his most in-depth answers so far revealed about his second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, Kavanaugh again denied having exposed himself to her in a drunken dormitory common room party his freshman year of college. He acknowledges the two knew each other in college, describing their relationship as “friendly, but not friends.” Kavanaugh’s confirmed the two had seen each since college, most recently at a mutual classmate’s wedding, where, as Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer’s New Yorker story noted, she did not mention the alleged incident and posed “smiling” in photographs with Kavanaugh.\n\n“I’m sure I saw her because it wasn’t a huge wedding. And at any wedding, you would see the people that you went to school with. But I don’t have a specific recollection,” Kavanaugh said.\n\nJames Roche, Kavanaugh’s freshman roommate — who told reporters that Kavanaugh was an excessive drinker and that he believed Ramirez, who was a close college friend, despite having no recollection of such an incident — also came up in the questioning. Kavanaugh claimed Roche, who then went by Jamie, “hated” their third roommate, Dave White:\n\nJamie and Dave White hated each other. They got in fights, fist fights during the year. One time Dave White was away for the weekend. Jamie — when he came back, Jamie had moved all Dave White’s furniture, everything, like into some other area of Lawrence Hall in a hallway.\n\nHe continued:\n\nI was friends with Dave White more than Jamie. I tried to be civil. Jamie wasn’t around a lot. I don’t know, I think his parents lived nearby, and so he was elsewhere or with a girl, I don’t know, a woman at Yale. [REDACTED] He didn’t hang out with us very much, wasn’t a great situation.\n\nThe transcript also includes extensive questioning about Kavanaugh’s high school yearbook that anti-trump activist and attorney Michael Avenatti has claimed contains secret codes about sexually assaulting girls. In one exchange, Kavanaugh explained that “devil’s triangle” referred to a drinking game he’d played in high school, not, as Avenatti claimed, a lewd sex act. Asked why he included the reference, Kavanaugh responded, “I don’t know. We were 17.”\n\nKavanaugh’s first use of the phrase “twilight zone,” which he also used in response to Avenatti’s client Julie Swetnick’s claims, occurs when discussing how “outraged” he is by the New Yorker/Deborah Ramirez story:\n\nThe New York Times says as recently as last week, she was calling around to other classmates saying she wasn’t sure I had done this. And you know, I think — I think we’re — this is an outrage for this kind of thin, uncorroborated, 35-year-old accusation to be leveled in this fashion at this time. I’ve been in the public eye for 24 years, since I started with the independent counsel in the fall of 1994, very public at various points in my life. I’ve been through six background checks. I worked in the White House at the highest levels, senior staff, traveling with the President all over the world, seeing the most highly sensitive secrets of our Nation for years. I went through a difficult confirmation process for the D.C. Circuit that was public with two separate confirmation hearings in 2004 and 2006. I’ve been a judge for 12 years in a very public way. I’ve been identified repeatedly as a potential Supreme Court nominee. Whether that was accurate or not, I’ve been publicly identified. My decisions have been publicly discussed. I’ve been very much a presence at the Yale College reunions. I’ve been on multiple panels there. So I’ve been active in the class. The class newsletter has talked about me. The people in my class have been at those reunions and those events. In all that time, not a word. And then 4 days, you know, when just right before a vote for the Supreme Court, after the nomination itself has been pending for months, and I’ve been through the hearings and 65 Senate meetings and all the written questions, and then — and then, after all these years, with all this time, and all these descriptions with no corroboration and with her best friend saying she never heard about it, you know, I’m — I’m really just, you know, stunned. And outraged. It’s the twilight zone. I guess we’re going to get to a few more of these twilight zone things…\n\nKavanaugh will testify in an open hearing Thursday morning to answer allegations from his first accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.'

article_114 = 'Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) invented Democrats’ smear tactics and “[Sen.] Dianne Feinstein perfected,” his smear tactics against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh, Montana state auditor Matt Rosendale told Breitbart News Saturday.\n\nRosendale, who hopes to defeat Sen. Tester in the Montana Senate race, told Breitbart News Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle that Tester invented the very smear tactics Democrats have used to smear Judge Kavanaugh’s name.\n\n“The only thing Judge Kavanaugh is guilty of is agreeing to serve on the Supreme Court and being nominated by President Trump,” Rosendale said. “That’s it, and the people of this state are disgusted with the demonstration that they saw over the last several weeks. Jon Tester invented this smear tactic, and Dianne Feinstein perfected it.” [Emphasis added.]\n\nRosendale reminded Breitbart News Saturday listeners that Tester, as the ranking member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, infamously tanked the nomination of President Donald Trump’s personal physician Admiral Ronnie Jackson with unfounded lies, accusations so that he could not serve as the Secretary of the Veterans Affairs Department.\n\n“What Tester did to Admiral Jackson should never be allowed,” Trump said. “Ronnie Jackson is a great man,” President Trump said a rally in Billings, Montana, in September.\n\nRosendale explained how the Montana Democrat invented the very tactics that Feinstein and other Democrats have used to attack Judge Kavanaugh.\n\nThe Montana conservative said, “The Washington Democrats’ smear tactic is just unacceptable to the people out here. Jon Tester came out and took a good man, admirable, Ronnie Jackson had been nominated for Veterans Affairs and released a bunch of information that was proven to be false.”\n\nSen. Tester announced last week that he would oppose Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, citing the nominee’s alleged positions on privacy, campaign finance, and the allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford. The Montana Democrat also said that he wished he could have met with Kavanaugh to discuss his concerns with the nominee; however, Rosendale contends that Tester had plenty of time to meet with the president’s nominee.\n\nRosendale said that Republicans “are extremely fired up I have had an overwhelming outpouring of support over the last couple of weeks because Jon made it clear and stated that he was not going to support Brett Kavanaugh. He told folks 90 days ago when Judge Kavanaugh was first nominated that he was going to give him the opportunity to meet with him and explain his positions on things, 30 days go by he wouldn’t take the meeting. Sixty days go by he wouldn’t take the meeting.”\n\n“He says that the White House canceled his meeting with Judge Kavanaugh and that’s why he wasn’t able to get the meeting,” Rosendale continued. “The White House came out and said that was completely false. Labor Day Weekend, the newspapers come out and print retractions, and he said he was mistaken, it wasn’t really the White House.”\n\nThe Montana Republican said that Tester support all of Barack Obama’s nominations 100 percent of the time, including Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor who said that the right to bear arms is not a “fundamental right.”\n\nRosendale charged, “Well I would tell you something, the folks of Montana overwhelming understand, not just believe, that it’s clearly written in our Constitution that the right to own a gun is a fundamental right and we should not be confirming a Supreme Court Justice who doesn’t understand that.”\n\nBoyle noted that Republicans and the American have become energized by the Supreme Court nomination process.\n\n“The Silent Majority is not so silent anymore,” Boyle contended.\n\nRosendale said that there’s an incredible amount of energy in Montana right now and his campaign will host a “Support Kavanaugh” rally on Saturday.\n\nRosendale concluded, “We’re having a ‘Support Kavanaugh’ rally in Billings, Montana today and the energy and enthusiasm is incredible. I got folks, and many of them are political pundits that have been involved for many years saying they have not seen anything like this in ten years.”\n\nBreitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern.'

article_115 = 'Debra Katz, attorney for Christine Blasey Ford, revealed Friday that her client will not urge lawmakers to further investigate allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nIn a sit-down interview with CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash, Katz said Ford does not want Democrats to pursue allegations against Kavanaugh if they retake Congress in November. “Professor Ford has not asked for anything of the sort. What she did was to come forward and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and agree to cooperate with any investigation by the FBI, and that’s what she sought to do here,” said Katz.\n\nAsked if Ford would like Democrats to consider bringing impeachment hearings against Kavanaugh, Katz responded with a simple “no.”\n\nLisa Banks, another lawyer for Ford, told Bash that the 51-year-old California psychology professor is at peace with her decision to go public with her decades-old allegation against the judge. “I don’t think she has any regrets. I think she feels like she did the right thing,” said Banks. “And this was what she wanted to do, which was provide this information to the committee so they could make the best decision possible. And I think she still feels that was the right thing to do, so I don’t think she has any regrets.”\n\nFurther, Banks criticized Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans for pointing out Ford was mistaken when she accused chairman Grassley of failing to accommodate her by traveling to her the West Coast to intimate her. “We, as her counsel, informed her of all options made available to us by the committee. We showed her all of the correspondence,” she told Bash “And what they were offering was sending staffers to speak to her. Dr. Ford wanted to speak to the committee members herself. And I think what you saw in the hearing was that Dr. Ford got a little confused and thought Sen. Grassley was suggesting that he himself would have come to California, which is not what he offered at all.”\n\nFord’s lawyers also said Ford was saddened by President Donald Trump’s remarks about her during a rally in Mississippi earlier this week. “It was very hurtful, as it would be to any woman. Any survivor who had the courage to come forward only to be mocked and belittled by anyone really, but certainly by the President of the United States, it was very upsetting. It was very hurtful,” Banks said.'

A new date of Wednesday was offered, with an initial deadline to accept of 5:00 p.m., but after rejecting a series of Ford’s lawyers controversial demands, a final extension of five hours was offered.\n\nAmong these demands were a Thursday or later hearing date and a prohibition on the Senate Judiciary Committee enlisting female outside lawyers to assist them in taking Ford’s testimony. Most controversially, Ford’s legal team demanded that Ford, the accuser, testify after the accused, Kavanaugh. In their final offer letter, Republican Judiciary Committee staff called this demand in a particular “an affront to fundamental notions of due process.”\n\nIf Grassley and his fellow Republicans on the Judiciary Committee stick to their announced plan, the committee will convene for a vote Monday. If, as expected, the Republican majority votes to approve Kavanaugh’s confirmation, it will pass to the full Senate, where a vote for cloture, setting up a final full-Senate vote, can be taken Wednesday morning. That final vote could then be taken Thursday, allowing Kavanaugh to take a seat on the Supreme Court in time of the start of the Court’s October term.\n\nIn her Friday night email, Katz insists that “the 10 p.m deadline is arbitrary. Its sole purpose is to bully Dr. Ford and deprive her of the ability to make a considered decision that has life-altering implications for her and her family.”\n\nTiming in the case, however, has serious implications for Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Without a hearing Monday, or at the very latest Wednesday, as Grassley had offered, confirming Kavanaugh before the start of the Supreme Court’s new term becomes virtually impossible."

article_121 = "A third high school student Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford claimed attended a party more than 35 years ago where the future Judge Kavanaugh attacked her denied any memory of the alleged incident in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, CNN reported Tuesday.\n\nCNN obtained a letter from Patrick J. Smyth, a Georgetown Prep alum who graduated in Kavanaugh’s class, to Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). The letter was penned after Ford apparently identified Smyth as “PJ” – another teenager who was one of around five people at a drunken gathering in a Montgomery County, Maryland, home in or around 1982.\n\n“I understand that I have been identified by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as the person she remembers as ‘PJ’ who supposedly was present at the party she described in her statements to the Washington Post,” the letter, penned by Smyth’s attorney, Eric Bruce, reads. “I am issuing this statement today to make it clear to all involved that I have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh.”\n\nSmyth remains Kavanaugh’s friend and had already written to the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of his nomination to the Supreme Court, calling him “singularly qualified to be an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court” in a letter co-authored by Georgetown Prep classmates of Kavanaugh.\n\n“Personally speaking, I have known Brett Kavanaugh since high school and I know him to be a person of great integrity, a great friend, and I have never witnessed any improper conduct by Brett Kavanaugh towards women,” Smyth’s new letter continues.\n\n“To safeguard my own privacy and anonymity, I respectfully request that the Committee accept this statement in response to any inquiry the Committee may have,” the letter explains, although, with the letter’s leaking to CNN, that anonymity is apparently at an end.\n\nThe denial is the third of the among five people Ford has claimed were present when Kavanaugh and classmate Mark Judge, both allegedly drunk, forced her into a room where Kavanaugh forced himself on top of Ford and groped her until she managed to escape without incident. Kavanaugh and Judge have both categorically denied any recollection of the incident or the high school party itself.\n\nThe exact number of attendees – like the date, location, and circumstances of the supposed party – has never been definitively fixed in any of Ford’s accounts. Some accounts include the attendance of a still not publicly identified female.\n\nFord, by her own account, told no one of the incident for three decades, revealing it only at a marriage counseling session in 2012. In July, she sent Feinstein a letter realleging the attack, but the ranking Democrat made no mention of it throughout Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, going public only after news reports of the letter began to emerge over the weekend.\n\nRepublicans set a Monday date for a hearing under oath on the matter, which Kavanaugh has agreed to attend. Ford, despite her attorney, Debra Katz’s, repeated assertions she is willing to testify, has not yet accepted her invitation to do so. After reports of her failure to accept the invitation emerged Tuesday, Katz returned to the airwaves to claim Ford will not appear until the FBI investigates her claims.\n\nThe FBI has repeatedly denied it is conducting an investigation, noting there is no potential federal crime contained in Ford’s allegations. A Monday Department of Justice statement made clear this is not a type of investigation the FBI performs as part of its background investigations. “The FBI does not make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation. The purpose of a background investigation is to determine whether the nominee could pose a risk to the national security of the United States,” the statement explained.\n\n“On the night of September 12, the FBI received a letter dated from July 2018 alleging that the nominee engaged in an incident of misconduct in the 1980s,” the statement continues. “Consistent with the memorandum of understanding, the FBI forwarded this letter to the White House Counsel’s Office. The allegation does not involve any potential federal crime. The FBI’s role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers.”\n\nWhile Chairman Grassley has made clear Monday’s hearing may be cancelled if Ford refuses to testify, Democrats echoed Katz’s demands for the FBI to get involved. One member of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Mazie Hirono, did so while further instructing “the men in this country” to “just shut up and step up.”"

I’m trying to tell people that this bothers me. I voted for their nominees.

Keith Ellison, the deputy chair of the DNC\n\nDemocratic National Committee (DNC) chair Tom Perez on Sunday said that a sexual misconduct allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “must be investigated thoroughly.”\n\nPerez’s statement comes as the DNC remains evasive about a domestic abuse allegation against Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the deputy chair of the DNC.\n\nPalo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh on Sunday of drunkenly trying to force himself on her at a party when they were in high school — an allegation Kavanaugh has denied.\n\nFord’s public accusation came two days after The New Yorker reported the substance of her claim but did not name her as the accuser.\n\n“This is a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land & this serious allegation must be investigated thoroughly,” Perez said in a statement posted to Twitter.\n\n“The American people deserve answers, not a vote that is rammed through by Republicans. There is too much at stake,” Perez added. His statement came after an earlier version of this article noted the DNC’s silence on the Kavanaugh allegation.\n\nThe allegation against Kavanaugh puts the DNC in an awkward position, as Perez has avoided saying whether he believes Ellison or Ellison’s accuser.\n\nEllison is accused of physically and emotionally abusing his ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan. Like Kavanaugh, Ellison denied the accusation against him.\n\nThe DNC announced on Aug. 14 — just hours before Ellison won the Democratic nomination for Minnesota attorney general — that it would be “reviewing” the Ellison accusation.\n\nBut the committee has yet to announce the results of its review and Perez has since deferred to an investigation by the party’s Minnesota arm, the Democratic Farmer-Labor party (DFL).\n\nThe DNC has aggressively advocated against Kavanaugh’s confirmation but steered clear of the sexual misconduct accusation until Perez’s tweet.\n\nDNC deputy communications chair Sabrina Singh did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the Kavanaugh allegation.\n\nLike the DNC, the DFL has remained elusive about the details of its Ellison investigation — for example, who exactly is running the investigation, how they’re conducting it and what the status of the probe is.\n\nDFL communications director Ellen Perrault did not return repeated requests for comment on the status of the DFL investigation.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a socialist independent widely expected to run for president as a Democrat in 2020, called on the Senate to postpone voting on Kavanaugh’s confirmation until a full investigation has been completed.\n\n“The allegation from Professor Christine Blasey Ford is a serious one that deserves a full investigation. Neither the Judiciary Committee nor the full Senate should vote on Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court until that takes place,” Sanders wrote on Twitter.\n\nSanders’ quickness to lend credibility to the accusation against Kavanaugh makes for a clear contrast with his treatment of the accusation against Ellison, one of the senator’s closest political allies.\n\nSanders said he has “nothing” to say about the Ellison allegation when asked on Aug. 16 and has remained tight-lipped on the issue since then.\n\nThe Democratic push to postpone Kavanaugh’s confirmation comes less than two months before the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nDemocrats have about a one-in-three chance of retaking the Senate and are strong favorites to retake the House of Representatives in November, according to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nThis article has been updated to note Perez’s statement on Sunday\n\nRead this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.com Top Dem Staffer Is Heading To Prison For Horrifying Crimes Against Republicans\n\nFollow Hasson on Twitter @PeterJHasson"

article_2653 = "Well, this backfired. And how.\n\nOver the weekend, a woman came forward accusing Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, of sexually assaulting her at a party while both were in high school. Or, to put it more accurately, Senator Dianne Feinstein came forward with an anonymously written letter from an accuser who gave vague details about an assault from over three decades ago. (RELATED: Democrats Push New Secret Document In Attempt to Demonize Brett Kavanaugh.)\n\nSen. Feinstein demanded that the FBI investigate the incident, which would, coincidentally, mean delaying Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote. The FBI has declined to investigate the matter, and passed the information along to the White House. (RELATED: Democrats’ Desperate Attempt to Take Down Kavanaugh Fails.)\n\nHowever, things took a dramatic turn over the past few days as Kavanaugh’s accuser has gone public. Christine Blasey Ford came out as the accuser and hired a lawyer, Debra Katz, to represent her.\n\nMany, including Senate Republicans, suspect this is a trap, given that Sen. Feinstein was informed about Ford’s allegations back in July but waited until just before the confirmation vote to divulge them. The timing, while brilliant politically, is suspect.\n\nRepublicans tried to force Ford’s hand and demanded she testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee. As Jonathan Swan and Mike Allen report in their newsletter this morning, this was a bet on Ford declining to testify. As Swan and Allen write, “This gambit basically bets that she will decline, and Republicans can then say that they tried to investigate further.”\n\nWell, because Republicans can never out-compete Democrats at playing hardball, that plan backfired in a major way. Axios reports that Ford is willing to testify before the Committee:\n\nDebra Katz, the attorney for Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault in the 1980s, told NBC’s “Today” that Ford believes the incident was “attempted rape” and is willing to testify publicly before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nNEW: The woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault is willing to testify publicly before the Senate Judiciary Committee. https://t.co/yj6lEV7kON — Axios (@axios) September 17, 2018\n\nYou can watch the interview below:\n\n“She has taken a polygraph.

By agreeing to testify, Ford may have just cost Kavanaugh the Supreme Court. Here’s why: The Senate Judiciary Committee will now be obliged to hear her testimony, thus delaying the confirmation vote, which was set to occur this week. It’s an open question of whether or not they can fast-track this testimony. We know Democrats will continue to delay it, hoping the vote is pushed beyond the November elections.\n\nRead this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.com Top Dem Staffer Is Heading To Prison For Horrifying Crimes Against Republicans\n\nRepublicans thought they were pulling a fast one over on Ford and her tenuous accusations.

article_2654 = "It’s now official: This entire situation is a farce that needs to end immediately. Anything less shows the Democrats are profoundly unserious about the allegations being made against Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nOver the weekend, Senator Dianne Feinstein made waves by going public with accusations against President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. First, she revealed that someone who knew Kavanaugh in high school accused him of sexually assaulting her. Then the accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, actually came out publicly.\n\nSenate Republicans tried to pull a fast one on her by challenging her to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. This was to call her bluff. Ford didn’t fall for it and agreed to testify, putting Republicans back on their heels, as now they have to oblige their own request, further delaying Kavanaugh’s vote. (RELATED: Kavanaugh Accuser Christine Ford Agrees to Republican Wishes – Will Testify Before Senate Judiciary Committee.)\n\nNow, Democrats should have everything they want. Ford should be able to testify before Congress as to the incident that occurred between her and Kavanaugh some three decades ago. But something is wrong – and it’s leading many Republicans to question both Ford’s and Feinstein’s sincerity.\n\nSenator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, says that Feinstein isn’t answering his calls to set up a time for Ford to testify. Here’s what he said in a newly released statement:\n\nThe standard procedure for updates to any nominee’s background investigation file is to conduct separate follow-up calls with relevant parties. In this case, that would entail phone calls with at least Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford. Consistent with that practice, I asked Senator Feinstein’s office yesterday to join me in scheduling these follow-ups. Thus far, they have refused. But as a necessary step in evaluating these claims, I’ll continue working to set them up.\n\nGrassley says Feinstein’s office is refusing to cooperate in setting up follow-up calls with Dr. Ford and Kavanaugh. “As a necessary step in evaluating these claims, I’ll continue working to set them up.” https://t.co/VamILXRiF3 — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) September 17, 2018\n\nIf Ford is telling the truth, there is no reason to delay. Feinstein is hurting her own credibility by not returning Grassley’s calls.\n\nWe already knew Democrats weren’t serious about getting to the bottom of these allegations. Senator Dick Durban already implied as much by suggesting that having Ford testify this week would be too soon.

(RELATED: There’s a Discrepancy in Kavanaugh Accuser’s Account of Sexual Assault.)\n\nHere’s the nagging part about the whole story: The accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, says she came forward with the allegations back in July through a letter to California Senator Dianne Feinstein. Feinstein sat on the letter until now. The timing couldn’t be more coincidental: Kavanaugh was due to be voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee this week.\n\nSo why did Feinstein wait until just this moment to drop the letter?\n\nWell, a more cynical observer might think it was deliberate. Feinstein knew that if the allegations were revealed earlier, they could be cleared up in time before a confirmation vote, assuming they are unsubstantiated.\n\nIf the allegations were as dire as Feinstein alleged, then there was no reason to sit on them until now. In fact, the sooner a sexual predator is outed, the better, if only for public safety. Feinstein’s delay is the first indicator that not everything is as it seems.\n\nNow, we just got further evidence that the entire accuser story may actually be a political ploy after all.

article_1434 = 'BY:\n\n\n\nEmails sent last week by a friend of Debra Katz, the lawyer representing Christine Blasey Ford who was recommended for the job by Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein, are soliciting members of the Georgetown Prep community for information and searching for additional women to accuse Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety.\n\nThe emails, obtained by the Washington Free Beacon, are seeking corroboration from classmates of Kavanaugh about yearbook entries and gang rape.\n\nOne email sent on Sept. 26 was delivered to roughly 50 alumni of Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart, an all girls school near Georgetown Prep, with the subject line, "Corroboration Needed."\n\n"Debra Katz needs to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms used by Brett Kavanaugh in his yearbook page meant—such as FFFF—Devil\'s Triangle—and Renate Alumnus," wrote Andrea Caputo Rose, who identifies herself as a friend of Katz. "If you can speak to any of these and are willing to sign an affidavit, please contact her."\n\nRose sent multiple inquiries to the Stone Ridge community, in emails that have grown increasingly political in nature. The most recent email asks classmates to use their "voice" to prevent Kavanaugh from sitting on the Supreme Court.\n\nRose, who runs an attorney search and placement company, also was soliciting classmates for information on the allegation made by Julie Swetnick, a client of Michael Avenatti. Swetnick claims while she was a college student she attended 10 high school parties where Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge drugged and participated in "train" rapes. Avenatti is a vocal opponent of President Donald Trump and also represents adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\n"In regard to Julie Swetnick, whose allegations of drugging and gang (‘train\') rape just came out through Michael Avenatti today, please also let me or Debra Katz know if you can corroborate any of her allegations," Rose wrote. "Time is critical if you have information and do not want to see Brett Kavanaugh sit on the Supreme Court for the next 40 years."\n\n"Please use your voice," she said. "You will not get a second chance."\n\nRose noted she removed several recipients from her email list who "expressed displeasure" from her two previous attempts to solicit scandalous information on Kavanaugh.\n\n"If anyone else is offended, please feel to let me know and I will remove your address from any further communication on this subject," she said.\n\nRose\'s previous correspondence sent to the class of 1983 took pains to be apolitical. Though Rose said she believed Ford, who claims Kavanaugh drunkenly attempted to rape her at a party when they were in high school, she said her intention was not to "promote a political agenda."\n\n"I am sure that many of you, like me, feel a personal connection to the events transpiring right now in regard to the possible appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court," Rose said. "This email is not intended to attack or support him (or Trump), but I would like to ask for your help with the goal of shaping a more open and transparent government."\n\n"Probably more so than Ms. Blasey Ford, many of us knew and hung out with Brett, Mark Judge, and their friends, we went to the same parties, to beach week, etc.," Rose said. "It sounds like we likely had many more interactions with him than Ms. Blasey Ford. I have never met her, but the story that she is telling sounds plausible to me, and I believe her."\n\nRose then asks for more women to come forward. No Stone Ridge alumni have accused Kavanaugh of wrongdoing, though additional uncorroborated claims have been made by Swetnick, who attended Gaithersburg High School, and Deborah Ramirez, a classmate of Kavanaugh at Yale. Ford attended Holton Arms, another neighboring all girls school that socialized with Georgetown Prep students.\n\n"Assuming that she is telling the truth, the odds are good that there may be other women who had a similar experience, and I am reaching out to you to help find out if this is the case," Rose said.\n\n"My request is simple—if you or someone you know has information regarding sexual or other misconduct by Brett Kavanaugh, regardless of when it occurred, please share your story," she said. "It is important even though it may have happened a long time ago."\n\nRose assured any woman who would come forward would be "treated confidentially" by Katz.

Ford claimed she was "100 percent" certain Kavanaugh attempted to sexually assault her. She could not explain how she got home, which was a 20-minute car ride from the party. All four people Ford named as attending the gathering have denied they were there, including her friend Leland Keyser, who claims they never socialized with Kavanaugh and says she does not know him.\n\nKavanaugh\'s confirmation was further delayed after Republicans acceded to Democrats\' request for the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh, which will conclude by the end of the week.'

Mazie Hirono (D.) said Democrats could keep the open seat on the Supreme Court vacant until after the 2020 election if Brett Kavanaugh\'s nomination collapses and Democrats regain control of the Senate in November.\n\nHirono pointed to the long vacancy of Antonin Scalia\'s former seat as a justification for holding off on confirming any nominee from President Donald Trump. When Barack Obama was president and Republicans held the Senate, Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not hold a vote on Obama\'s nominee Merrick Garland, and Hirono said Democrats could do the same if they had the Senate.\n\n"I think we’ve had those kinds of vacancies before, and we certainly had over a one-year vacancy with Merrick Garland," Hirono told Politico Magazine. "So the world does not come to an end because we don’t fill all of the nominees."\n\nIn 2016, Hirono criticized her Republican colleagues for not considering the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. "It is unprecedented to announce unilaterally that no part of advice and consent will occur until after an election."\n\n"There is a law enacted nearly 150 years ago that says that the Supreme Court shall consist of nine justices, which also presumes that when a vacancy occurs, the President will nominate a replacement and the Senate will provide advice and consent," Hirono continued. "In my view, this law is violated when Senate Republicans say that it’s ok to leave a vacancy unfilled for over a year."\n\nKavanaugh’s nomination has been delayed in the wake of an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor, that he attempted to sexually assault her while they attended high school in the 1980s. Kavanaugh and Ford are both set to speak at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Monday.\n\nHirono said she believes Ford’s story. "These are serious allegations. She has a very credible story. I believe her. And now we have to do more than say, ‘Well, look at the timing!’ and ‘Well, it’s all politically motivated!’"'

The academic paper, entitled “Meditation With Yoga, Group Therapy With Hypnosis, and Psychoeducation for Long-Term Depressed Mood: A Randomized Pilot Trial,” described the results of a study that tested the efficacy of certain treatments on 46 depressed individuals. The study was published by the Journal of Clinical Psychology in May 2008.\n\nWhile the paper by Ford and several other co-authors focused on whether various therapeutic techniques, including hypnosis, alleviate depression, it also discussed the therapeutic use of hypnosis to “assist in the retrieval of important memories” and to “create artificial situations” to assist in treatment.\n\nFord’s paper cited a controversial 1964 paper on the use of hypnosis to treat alcoholics and claimed that “hypnosis could be used to improve rapport in the therapeutic relationship, assist in the retrieval of important memories, and create artificial situations that would permit the client to express ego-dystonic emotions in a safe manner.” The study by Ford and her co-authors also used “self-hypnosis” to help treat their randomized sample of patients.\n\n“Participants also were taught self-hypnosis to use outside the group for relaxation and affect regulation (as described in H. Spiegel & Spiegel, 2004),” the researchers explained. “The group’s experiences using hypnosis were the basis for discussion in the middle of the group sessions.”\n\nThe 2004 text by Spiegel and Spiegel referenced by Ford and her fellow researchers discusses in detail the use of hypnotism, and even self-hypnotism, to recover memories from traumatic episodes.\n\n“Remember that all hypnosis is really self-hypnosis,” the authors of the referenced 2004 text on hypnotism wrote. “[T]herefore, therapists are only tapping into their patients’ natural ability to enter trance state.”\n\nThe authors noted that hypnosis as a means of recovering traumatic memories could also lead to the “contamination” of those memories.\n\n“Patients are highly suggestible and easily subject to memory contamination,” they noted.\n\nIt is not known whether Ford underwent hypnotic therapy regarding her alleged assault, as she and her attorneys have refused to provide detailed notes from her therapists to the Senate despite providing portions to reporters for the Washington Post. Ford testified under oath that Kavanaugh’s name appears nowhere in her therapists’ notes.\n\nRachel Mitchell, the Arizona sex-crimes prosecutor who questioned Ford during her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday, noted in her official report on Ford’s testimony that Ford’s ever-changing story was likely affected by the behavior of Ford’s attorneys, as well as the Democratic lawmakers and their staffs who interacted with Ford prior to her testimony.\n\nMitchell noted that Ford’s story seemed to change with each telling. In a July 6 text to the Washington Post, Ford claimed she was assaulted in the “mid 1980s.” That changed to the “early 80s” in a July 30 letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). Similarly, she claimed that the assault happened to her in her “late teens,” before claiming that it happened when she was 15.\n\nFord also claimed to not know where the alleged incident even happened, who took her there initially, or how she got home afterward. Ford’s account of the number and identity of individuals at the party in question has also changed repeatedly. Thus far, she has failed to provide any corroborating evidence whatsoever to support her account. Furthermore, each individual she named as having witnessed the alleged event either failed to corroborate her account or outright refuted it.\n\nKavanaugh’s recommendation was voted out of committee last week on a party-line vote, and the full Senate is awaiting the results of a supplemental FBI background investigation of Kavanaugh prior to moving forward with his nomination on the Senate floor."

DC Bar – into Ford’s attorneys malpractice.#payback — Kevin McCullough (@KMCRadio) September 30, 2018\n\nIt has been widely reported that the Senate Judiciary Committee offered to send investigators to California to speak with Ford. Ford did not accept this offer. In addition, Ford reportedly was unable to attend a hearing set for Sept. 24 because she is afraid of flying and could not otherwise get to Washington by that date. The committee agreed to delay its hearing to Sept. 27.\n\nYet in her testimony, Ford stated it was not clear to her that the Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC) had offered to take her statements and testimony in California to prevent her from having to fly. Ford testified she would have accepted the offer had she known about it.\n\nIndeed, she testified to Chairman Chuck Grassley, “If you were gonna come out to see me I would have happily hosted you and would have been happy to speak to you out there. It wasn’t clear to me that that was the case.” Ford also testified, “I was hoping that they would come to me [in California] but I realized that was an unrealistic request.” Not only was it not unrealistic, the offer was on the table.\n\nHere I’ll assume Ford testified truthfully that she was not clear about the Judiciary Committee’s offer. (The alternative raises its own issues.) If Ford’s attorneys did not inform her clearly of the SJC’s offer, the Judiciary Committee could file a grievance against Ford’s attorneys, Debra Katz and Michael Bromwich, with the DC Bar. It would be even worse if they withheld this information from Ford because they were interested in a delay of the hearing for reasons other than their client’s interests.\n\nLawyers have obligations to their clients and to the tribunals before which they practice. In this case, the client is Ford, and the tribunal is the SJC.\n\nDC Bar Rule 1.4(b), “Communication,” provides that “A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.” Did Ford’s lawyers withhold from her the SJC’s offer to take her statement in California? Or did they fail to make clear to Ford what the SJC had offered?\n\nIt beggars belief to think the offer could not be conveyed clearly. “The committee will take your testimony in California and you will not have to fly anywhere” seems straightforward enough. Grassley informed Minority Ranking Member Sen. Dianne Feinstein that “I have offered [Dr. Ford] the opportunity to testify in any of four possible venues: (1) a public hearing; (2) a private hearing; (3) a public staff interview; or (4) a private staff interview. I am even willing to have my staff travel to Dr. Ford in California — or anywhere else — to obtain her testimony.” It’s hard to see how that could be stated more clearly.\n\nBottom line, did Ford’s lawyers deprive Ford of the opportunity to make an informed decision about whether to accept that offer? Ford’s testimony that she was not clear about the SJC’s offer, and that she would have accepted it had she known about and understood it, certainly suggests so. If this is the case, counsel arguably violated Rule 1.4(b).\n\nCounsel also owes a duty of candor to the tribunal, in this case the committee. Under DC Bar Rule 3.3, attorneys cannot make a false statement of fact or law to the tribunal. If Ford’s fear of flying would not have prevented her from testifying on Sept. 24 in California, then any representation they made to the committee that such fear of flying was the basis for a delay was a false statement. This seems particularly egregious if, as Ford’s testimony suggests, she did not realize the committee had offered to take her testimony in California and avoid Ford having to fly anywhere.\n\nDC Bar Rule 4.4 provides that “In representing a client, a lawyer shall not use means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person, or knowingly use methods of obtaining evidence that violate the legal rights of such a person.” If Ford would have accepted the committee’s offer to testify in California, the committee could have completed that process well before the hearing on Sept. 27.\n\nFord’s counsel stated on Sept. 17, the day after the Washington Post published an aticle identifying Ford as Kavanaugh’s accuser, that Ford was ready to tell her story and, indeed, wanted an opportunity to tell her story. The committee, in all likelihood, could have had investigators in California by Sept. 19 prepared to speak with Ford, gather information, and pursue any leads. The SJC could then have held the public hearing in California on Sept. 24, as offered. Yet Ford was apparently unaware of or unclear about this option, and the hearing was put off until Sept. 27.\n\nGiven Ford’s testified-to willingness to speak to the SJC investigators in California, there seems no reasonable basis for the delay of the hearing to Sept. 27. Make no mistake, this delay unquestionably delayed and burdened numerous third persons. It obviously burdened Kavanaugh, who was subjected to further efforts from Senate Democrats to tarnish his name. We know Senate Democrats used this time for precisely this purpose. Debra Ramirez, the second accuser whose allegations were published in The New Yorker, stated she was contacted by Senate Democrats, not the other way around.\n\nThe delay also burdened the tribunal, the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead of having the opportunity to collect facts essential to the SJC’s consideration of Kavanaugh’s nomination in a manner that could have minimized the publicity associated with the case, which could potentially affect witnesses, the committee lost ten critical days and subjected the process to the very public scrutiny Ford sought to avoid.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, the delay and the failure to accept the SJC’s offer even embarrassed and harmed their client, Ford. Giving her testimony in California to Senate investigators would have allowed Ford to maintain at least a modicum of the privacy she desired.\n\nFord testified she was “terrified” about having to go before the SJC. Yet if her lawyers failed to tell or adequately explain to her that she could provide her testimony to investigators in California, outside the Washington spotlight and in a setting she would have preferred, her lawyers were the ones responsible for putting her in that terrifying situation. If they did it because it benefitted someone other than their client, that would be an extraordinary breach of the duty they owe their client. It would also suggest conflicts of interest, a subject on which the DC Bar Rules of Professional Responsibility have plenty to say.\n\nAnd for what was this delay needed? Ford’s story was Ford’s story. It should not have changed between Sept. 17 and Sept. 27. She could have told it to Senate investigators on Sept. 19 and in a hearing on Sept. 24 just as easily as on Sept. 27.\n\nHere’s a thought experiment: Imagine a federal district judge instructing an attorney to convey information to his or her client of something, and the attorney failing to do so. That attorney would be in a world of trouble. Depending on the judge, volcanic might not begin to describe the reaction. That’s what’s happened here if Ford did not know of or understand the offer to take her testimony in California.\n\nFor the last several weeks, the SJC Republican majority has been a marionette for activist Democratic lawyers, who keep demanding delay after delay. It’s time to go on offense. If this hearing was delayed by false representations by Ford’s attorneys and withholding information from their client, there may be grounds for the SJC to file a grievance with the DC Bar. If I were in the SJC majority, I’d be exploring those right now.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, what do you think?"

article_2002 = 'President Donald Trump ignited a crowd at a campaign rally in Mississippi on Tuesday by mocking a woman who has claimed she was sexually assaulted by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh decades ago.\n\nThe audience laughed as Trump ran through a list of what he described as holes in Christine Blasey Ford\'s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. She testified that Kavanaugh pinned her on a bed, tried to take off her clothes and covered her mouth in the early 1980s, when the two were teenagers. Kavanaugh has denied Ford\'s allegations.\n\n"How did you get home? \'I don\'t remember,\'" Trump said at the rally in Southaven. "How did you get there? \'I don\'t remember.\' Where is the place? \'I don\'t remember.\' How many years ago was it? \'I don\'t know. I don\'t know. I don\'t know.\'"\n\nImitating Ford, he added, "But I had one beer — that\'s the only thing I remember."\n\nIt marked the sharpest criticism by Trump of Ford since she came forward publicly with the allegation last month. He had previously called Ford a "very credible witness."\n\nFord\'s lawyer Michael Bromwich called Trump\'s attack "vicious, vile and soulless."\n\n"Is it any wonder that she was terrified to come forward, and that other sexual assault survivors are as well?" Bromwich tweeted. "She is a remarkable profile in courage. He is a profile in cowardice."\n\nThe president was in Mississippi on Tuesday looking to use his influence to sway the outcome of a low-profile election that could tip the balance of the Senate.\n\nAs Republicans fight headwinds ahead of the Nov. 6 midterm election, Trump sought to rally his supporters behind GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who was appointed to fill the seat of Republican Thad Cochran, who retired in April. She faces three candidates — Republican Chris McDaniel and Democrats Mike Espy and Tobey Bernard Bartee — in next month\'s special election for the remainder of the two-year term.\n\n"She\'s always had my back," Trump said. "She\'s always had your back. And a vote for Cindy is a vote for me."\n\nBut Trump spent much of the rally lamenting the treatment of Kavanaugh by Democrats, whose attacks, he said, had taken their toll on the judge\'s family.\n\n"A man\'s life is in tatters," he said. Of Democrats, he added, "These are really evil people."\n\nHe even raised questions about the drinking habits of Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy in an attempt to turn the tables on Democrats who have gone after Kavanaugh\'s beer drinking. Trump told the crowd they should do an online search for "Patrick Leahy slash drink." Leahy\'s office didn\'t immediately return a message seeking comment Tuesday.\n\nSome Republicans and White House allies have suggested the allegations against Kavanaugh can be potent political fodder in the run-up to Nov. 6, animating GOP voters who have so far lacked the same motivation to head to the polls as their Democratic counterparts.\n\nRepublican officials and the White House expect Hyde-Smith\'s race to go to a runoff under the state\'s jungle election rules that force a showdown between the top two finishers if no candidate wins at least 50 percent of the vote on Election Day. With Republicans defending majorities in the House and Senate next month, officials cast Trump\'s visit as an attempt to get ahead of a potentially perilous situation.\n\nOfficials said Trump is seeking to boost Hyde-Smith as close as possible to the 50 percent threshold and lend momentum for a possible runoff. Depending on how Republicans perform on Nov. 6, the eyes of the nation could fall on a Nov. 27 Mississippi runoff in what could become an expensive and high-profile race to determine control of the Senate.\n\n"Your vote in this election will decide which party controls the United States Senate," Trump said.\n\nA vocal minority of the crowd Tuesday backed the other conservative in the race, McDaniel, a state senator, and booed Hyde-Smith when Trump introduced her. They launched into occasional chants of "We want Chris."\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Trump told electrical contractors gathered in Philadelphia that his economic policies would translate into more jobs for their ranks as he highlighted a new trade deal among the U.S., Mexico and Canada.\n\n"We\'re in the midst of a manufacturing renaissance — something which nobody thought you\'d hear," Trump said in a speech to the National Electrical Contractors Association Convention a day after celebrating the new North American trade deal.\n\nIn fact, North America already is a manufacturing powerhouse. The United States ranks No. 2 in the world behind China in manufacturing output. Mexico ranks 11th and Canada 13th, according to United Nations numbers pulled together by the Brookings Institution.\n\nTrump calls the new trade agreement USMCA, for U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. "Like YMCA or U.S. Marine Corps with an A at the end," he explained.\n\nHe said he doesn\'t want to use the previous name, NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he contends cost American jobs and railed against during his 2016 presidential campaign. The new trade deal still must be approved by Congress.\n\n"We are finally rebuilding our country, and we are doing it with American aluminum, American steel and with our great electrical contractors," he said.\n\nTrump said the strong economy "means more jobs for our great electrical contractors."\n\nBefore departing the White House, Trump tweeted, "THE ONLY REASON TO VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT IS IF YOU\'RE TIRED OF WINNING!"'

article_2004 = 'Her 1991 testimony against Clarence Thomas riveted the nation, but failed to derail his nomination to the Supreme Court. Now, 27 years later, Anita Hill says the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing — with no FBI investigation and no witness testimony — is destined to be unfair, just as she and many others felt the Thomas hearing was.\n\nStill, she says, whatever happens, don\'t look at the Kavanaugh case as a referendum on the #MeToo movement, or a barometer of its success. #MeToo is much bigger than that — and the ship has sailed.\n\n"A lot is different now," Hill, 62, says of the year since the movement was launched, following scandalous revelations about producer Harvey Weinstein. "A number of powerful men have been held accountable. I don\'t think any one episode is going to define a whole movement."\n\nBesides, she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Tuesday night, "Remember, #MeToo is about raising awareness. Just because the Senate\'s awareness hasn\'t been raised, doesn\'t mean that the rest of us haven\'t evolved and learned.\'"\n\nIn the years since she sat in that bright turquoise suit, in front of an estimated 20 million TV viewers, and calmly and deliberately recounted her allegations of workplace harassment against Thomas, Hill has been somewhat of a reluctant heroine to many women, living a quiet academic life at Brandeis University for two decades now. The Kavanaugh hearing, in which Christine Blasey Ford will detail her allegation of a sexual assault from when she and the judge were teenagers — a charge he denies — has trained the spotlight on Hill again, as people recall her 1991 ordeal and discuss similarities.\n\nHill herself will be nowhere near Washington when Thursday\'s hearing takes place. She\'ll be in Salt Lake City, where she was giving a lecture Wednesday evening at the University of Utah.\n\nAsked what advice she might give Ford, Hill is typically measured in response.\n\n"Our circumstances are very different," she says. "And I try not to give blanket advice because these situations are just so personal. I don\'t know her, I don\'t know her state of mind, the entirety of her story. It\'s unprofessional as a lawyer but insensitive as a human being, to mete out personal advice to someone you don\'t know."\n\nOne thing Hill does know, she says, is that the session will be stacked against Ford.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to imagine it can be fair," she says, criticizing the lack of an FBI investigation and allow witnesses to testify (only Kavanaugh and Ford will testify).\n\n"Sexual assault does not happen in a vacuum," Hill says. "There is a context." Ford contends a drunken Kavanaugh groped her and tried to take off her clothes at a party when he was 17 and she was 15. Ford says Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream.\n\nA full investigation would provide context, says Hill, such as the culture of high school drinking that Kavanaugh may have been part of. "The reason I think it\'s not going to be fair is that it doesn\'t give you all the information," she says. "And I believe it is designed to pit his word against hers, and we know that (he) has all of the power of the presidency behind him. And she doesn\'t."\n\nIt\'s not lost on Hill, and many others, that the current Judiciary Committee shares some optics with the committee that questioned her. In 1991 it was composed of 14 white men; there were only two women in the entire Senate. Now the committee\'s 11 Republicans are all men. Of 10 Democrats, four are women.\n\nThe composition of the committee "doesn\'t surprise me because the Senate is dominated by men," Hill says. "There are women on the committee, and that\'s new, but the overwhelming vision of the Senate Judiciary committee is still largely white and male. We know that even a few women can change the conversation, so we have to keep pushing to make sure that representation IS truly representative."\n\nPart of Hill\'s work today is as head of a commission in Hollywood aimed at targeting sexual abuse and harassment in media and entertainment.\n\n"It\'s not a short term project," she says. "It will take time because we are looking at an entire industry and it\'s an industry made up of different components." But, she says, "I\'ll tell you that a new level of awareness has come in the last year or so."\n\nHill has plans that go beyond her #MeToo-related work and her teaching. She is finally starting in earnest this year, she says, a longtime project to sort through thousands of letters of support from 1991 and 1992. Many writers gave descriptions of their harassment or abuse.\n\n"It\'s going to be interesting to see whether or not peoples\' experiences have changed in the past 20-something years," she says.\n\nHere\'s something that hasn\'t changed: that famous suit. Hill never put it on again, and resolved to one day let it go and give it to the Smithsonian.\n\n"No update," Hill says with a sigh. "It\'s still in a garment bag. But yes, it will leave my possession at some point. I haven\'t quite figured out when."'

That was 40 years ago.\n\n"It has nothing to do about what we\'re talking about today about this man being a judge on the Supreme Court."'

article_2008 = 'Top Republicans voiced confidence Thursday that Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the US Supreme Court this weekend, as they asserted that an FBI probe had found nothing to support sexual assault allegations against President Donald Trump\'s nominee.\n\n"Judge Kavanaugh should be confirmed on Saturday," Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters.\n\n"Hopefully, we\'re 48 hours away from having a new person on the Supreme Court," he added.\n\n"I hope we can just move forward and get this done," said another senior Republican senator, Orrin Hatch of Utah.\n\n"I apologize to him for the way he\'s been treated," Hatch said.\n\nHe defended the FBI investigation into the sexual assault accusations against the 53-year-old conservative appeals court judge, which Democrats have criticized as "incomplete" and "very limited."\n\n"We have found nothing, nothing to corroborate accusations against him," Hatch said. I\'m grateful to the FBI for their efforts in doing a thorough, very important investigation."\n\nKavanaugh\'s confirmation for a lifetime appointment on the nation\'s top court hinges on the votes of three Republicans, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski, in the Senate, where Republicans hold a slim 51-49 majority.\n\nNone of the three was present at the press conference by the senior Republican lawmakers.\n\nAs they talked to reporters, a Democratic senator who had been seen as a potential vote for Kavanaugh, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, said she would oppose his confirmation.\n\nThe White House expressed confidence that nothing in a supplemental FBI investigation prompted by sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh would derail the Supreme Court nominee, as Senate Republicans press ahead with plans for a Friday test vote.\n\nA top Senate Republican said Thursday the confidential FBI report on charges that Brett Kavanaugh sexually abused women three decades ago "found no hint of misconduct" by the Supreme Court nominee.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, made his remarks — and urged his colleagues to confirm the conservative judge — in a written statement hours after the post-midnight delivery of the FBI document to Congress. With Kavanaugh\'s uncertain prospects for approval depending in part on the decisions of five wavering senators, lawmakers began viewing the document in a secure room in the Capitol complex.\n\n"There\'s nothing in it that we didn\'t already know," Grassley contended, basing his comment on a briefing he said he\'d received from committee aides. He added, "This investigation found no hint of misconduct."\n\nPerhaps more importantly, two key senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Jeff Flake of Arizona, expressed satisfaction with the FBI report.\n\nCollins, who has not indicated how she would vote, said that “It appears to be a very thorough investigation but I’m going back later to personally read the interviews.”\n\nFlake told reporters, “We’ve seen no additional corroborating information.”\n\nCollins, Flake and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are the critical votes that could ensure Brett M. Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court.\n\nDemocrats have complained that the FBI\'s reopening of its Kavanaugh background check has been far too limited, leaving out contact with crucial potential witnesses. They say some people had reached out to be interviewed by the FBI or the Judiciary Committee but were not questioned.\n\nWhite House spokesman Raj Shah rebuffed that idea, saying, "What critics want is a never-ending fishing expedition into high school drinking." He said the FBI reached out to 10 people and interviewed nine, including "several individuals at the request of the Senate, and had a series of follow-up interviews ... following certain leads."\n\nWhile the FBI interviews were to focus on sexual assault allegations, Democrats have also questioned his drinking habits during high school and college and dishonest comments they say he\'s made about his background. Kavanaugh has said stories of bad behavior while drinking are exaggerated.\n\nGrassley said the FBI could not "locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations," and he said there is "no contemporaneous evidence." He provided no specific detail.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has already started a process that will produce a crucial test vote in his polarized chamber Friday on Kavanaugh\'s fate. Should Republicans get the majority of votes they need — and Vice President Mike Pence is available to cast the tie-breaker, if necessary — that would set up a decisive roll call on his confirmation, likely over the weekend.\n\n"Senators ought to wipe away the muck from all the mudslinging and politics and look at this nomination with clear eyes," Grassley said, echoing accusations against Democrats that McConnell has been making. He added, "It\'s time to vote. I\'ll be voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh."\n\nThree women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in separate incidents in the 1980s. Kavanaugh, 53, now a judge on the powerful District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, has denied the claims.\n\nThe White House received the FBI report around 3 a.m. Thursday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump weighed in hours later in a tweet in which he denounced what he called "the harsh and unfair treatment" of Kavanaugh. "This great life cannot be ruined by mean" and "despicable Democrats and totally uncorroborated allegations!"\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois told reporters Thursday that time slots for reading the FBI file are so full that senators are being told they might have to wait until Friday to read it. "They\'re so swamped," she said.\n\nThe report arrived at a Capitol palpably tense over the political stakes of the nomination fight and from aggressive anti-Kavanaugh protesters who have rattled and reportedly harassed senators. Feeding the anxiety was an unusually beefy presence of the U.S. Capitol Police, who were keeping demonstrators and frequently reporters at arm\'s length by forming wedges around lawmakers walking through corridors.\n\nBarring leaks, it was unclear how much of the FBI report, if any, would be made public. While senators from both sides have expressed support for revealing at least parts of the findings, FBI background checks on nominees are supposed to remain confidential.\n\nWith Republicans clinging to a razor-thin 51-49 Senate majority and five senators — including three Republicans — still publicly undeclared, the conservative jurist\'s prospects of Senate confirmation could hinge largely on the file\'s contents.\n\nThe three undecided GOP senators rebuked Trump for mocking one accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, by mimicking her responses to questions at last week\'s dramatic Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters that Trump\'s lampooning of Ford at a Tuesday night Mississippi campaign rally was "just plain wrong." Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, called it "wholly inappropriate and in my view unacceptable," and Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said on NBC\'s "Today" show that the remarks were "kind of appalling."\n\nThose senators, along with Democrats Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have yet to declare how they will vote.\n\nTrump drew laughs Tuesday with his rendition of how Ford answered questions at last week\'s hearing. "I had one beer — that\'s the only thing I remember," he stated inaccurately.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Trump\'s insults marked a "new low."\n\nUnderscoring rising tensions, Democrats suggested that previous FBI background checks of Kavanaugh may have unearthed misconduct by the nominee.\n\nDemocrats wrote to Grassley challenging a Tuesday tweet by GOP aides saying prior investigations never found "a whiff of ANY issue — at all — related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse." Democrats wrote that the GOP tweet contained information that is "not accurate."\n\nCommittee Republicans tweeted in response that their prior tweet was "completely truthful" and accused Democrats of "false smears."\n\nThe California psychology professor has testified that a drunken Kavanaugh sexually abused her in a locked room at a high school party in the 1980s and has said she believed he was trying to rape her.\n\nThe FBI interviewed several people, including three who Ford has said attended a 1982 high school gathering in suburban Maryland where she says Kavanaugh\'s attack occurred, plus another Kavanaugh friend. The agency has also spoken to a second woman, Deborah Ramirez, who has claimed Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a Yale party when both were freshmen.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.'

article_2493 = "Brett Kavanaugh has located his personal calendars from the summer of 1982, and they could be used to exonerate him of accusations made by Christine Blasey Ford, the New York Times reported Sunday.\n\nKavanaugh plans to hand the documentation over to the Senate Judiciary Committee this week.\n\nWhat's on the calendars?\n\nThe calendars reportedly do not list a party mentioned by Ford in her accusation.\n\nKavanaugh’s team has admitted they do not disprove anything. For example, he could have attended a party that is not listed. But his team will argue to senators that they also offer no proof of her claim that he allegedly pinned her to a bed and attempted to remove her clothing, the report notes.\n\nThe New York Times stated it examined the calendar pages from June, July and August of 1982, which detail that Kavanaugh was for most of the summer either out of town, at the beach or away with his parents. Included on the calendars are “basketball games, movie outings, football workouts and college interviews.”\n\nA few parties are listed but do not show names of friends mentioned by Blasey, the report stated.\n\nSenators are trying to confirm or deny Blasey’s account of the alleged sexual assault. She has said she cannot recall the exact day or location, but believes it was in the summer of 1982. Blasey has also said she was wearing a bathing suit with other clothing on top of it.\n\nKavanaugh has denied the allegations.\n\nKavanaugh and Blasey are scheduled to testify before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, which is considering whether to endorse his Supreme Court nomination. The New York Times called it a “public test of credibility.”\n\nBlasey’s sexual assault allegation is slowing down what was seemed to be a swift path to confirmation for Kavanaugh.\n\nHow old were they back then?\n\nAt the time of the alleged assault, Blasey would have been 15 and Kavanaugh, 17.\n\nBack then, Kavanaugh was a student at the all-boys Georgetown Preparatory School, and Blasey was attending the the all-girls Holton-Arms School. Students from the two private schools in the Maryland suburbs sometimes socialized together, the report notes.\n\nKavanaugh’s advisers have said Blasey's account of what happened will not be challenged, but they will argue it was not him, the report stated."
