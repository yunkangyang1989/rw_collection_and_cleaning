wsj,Main Street: It's Susan Collins's Moment,"If Brett Kavanaugh were on trial for sexual assault, all he'd need do is demonstrate reasonable doubt about the charges being made against him. But a Republican nominee to the Supreme Court is tried in the media, where Mr. Kavanaugh must now do the impossible: prove an assault never happened.Christine Blasey Ford alleges that at a high-school party 36 years ago, 17-year-old Brett Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, tried to remove her clothes, and covered her mouth so she couldn't scream. Ms. Ford, now a professor at California's Palo Alto University, says she was able to flee the room only after a friend of Mr. Kavanaugh's, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them and they all tumbled off the bed. Ms. Ford further says she didn't tell anyone what happened at the time.Judge Kavanaugh's denial is categorical: ""I have never done anything like what the accuser describes -- to her or anyone,"" he said in a statement Monday. Mr. Judge likewise denies it all. ""It's just absolutely nuts,"" he told the Weekly Standard. ""I never saw Brett act that way.""The truth is, no one knows what went on in that Maryland bedroom at that party -- or if Mr. Kavanaugh was even there. Absent corroborating testimony, even the Federal Bureau of Investigation would have no way to reveal much more.So here we are, just days before what should have been a Thursday vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Since Ms. Ford's name became public, one member of that committee, Jeff Flake, the retiring Republican from Arizona, announced he wouldn't feel comfortable going ahead with a vote without a fuller airing of Ms. Ford's complaint. In a committee of 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats, Mr. Flake would give the Democrats the majority they need to stall a vote.Republicans Bob Corker, the retiring senator from Tennessee, and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski have also come out against holding a vote until Ms. Ford can be heard. They are joined by Democratic incumbents facing tight election races in states carried by Donald Trump: Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Joe Manchin (W.Va.). Though Democrats would love to kill the Kavanaugh nomination, the more practical aim is a lengthy delay that would spare these Democrats a tough vote before the November midterms.But there's another senator who may hold the key to whether the GOP hangs together or heads for the tall grass. On Sunday Maine Republican Susan Collins told the New York Times that she considers the allegations of sexual assault serious and wants Ms. Ford interviewed to get her whole story. Just as telling, she made clear she finds the low and the last-minute nature of the way the Democrats handled the charges fishy.""If they believed Professor Ford, why didn't they surface this information earlier so that he could be questioned about it?"" Ms. Collins said. ""And if they didn't believe her and chose to withhold the information, why did they decide at the 11th hour to release it? It is really not fair to either of them the way it was handled.""Ms. Collins's complaints about fairness aren't easily dismissed. She's a strong advocate for women's rights; she announced in 2016 she wouldn't vote for Donald Trump; and she hasn't been afraid to buck her party, as when she voted against ObamaCare repeal. She's also firmly pro-choice but recently stood up to a nasty crowdfunding effort to bribe her into voting against Judge Kavanaugh over claims he would overturn Roe v. Wade.In remarks to reporters Monday afternoon, Ms. Collins called for accuser and accused to testify before the Judiciary Committee under oath. Not long after that, the Judiciary Committee scheduled a one-day hearing Monday on the issue. Ms. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh will each be heard.This is a risky accommodation, because the media and Democrats won't be satisfied no matter what Republicans do. But if it provides the space GOP senators need to move ahead to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, it may be the least damaging accommodation. The test is whether the hearing serves the purpose of keeping confirmation process close to schedule, or whether it will be turn into what the Democrats are really pushing for: the first of many delaying actions to come -- what one Judiciary Committee staffer describes as ""Borking 2.0.""By all means let's hear what Ms. Ford has to say. But let us hope Ms. Collins insists it not be at the expense of fairness to Judge Kavanaugh. Because right now the effort to put off his confirmation votes seems aimed at establishing an odious, new post-hearing precedent, whereby a single, inconclusive and uncorroborated #MeToo accusation can upend all Senate norms and leave a man with an otherwise sterling reputation twisting in the wind."
wsj,Christine Blasey Ford vs. Brett Kavanaugh,"Regarding your editorial ""The #MeToo Kavanaugh Ambush"" (Sept. 18): I am watching with anger and sadness the Democrats' last-ditch effort to derail the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. I wonder if the Democrats have thought this tactic out. If it works with an unverifiable accusation, who will be safe in the contentious midterm political campaign season finale in November? If Judge Kavanaugh, who has an impeccable reputation going back decades and has been through six very thorough background checks by the FBI, can be destroyed, who can't be?Nancy IngalsbeeAllegan, Mich.---As a wife and mother of a teenage son, I have sympathy for Christine Blasey Ford but find Mr. Kavanaugh's predicament truly terrifying. Ms. Ford doesn't know the day, month or even the exact year the alleged attack occurred. She doesn't describe herself as being drugged or drunk on arrival at the party, yet she seems unable to recall the address or even the general location of the house where the incident allegedly occurred, remembering only that it was somewhere in Montgomery County, Md. Presumably too young to drive, Ms. Ford cannot explain how she arrived at the party or how she returned home. She does remember wearing a swimsuit and being attacked by Mr. Kavanaugh in a bedroom, with Mark Judge looking on. Mr. Judge, the only other party guest whose name Ms. Ford can recall, vehemently denies the incident ever happened. Notes from a 2012 therapist visit by Ms. Ford reference the supposed attack, but don't mention Mr. Kavanaugh by name and contradict Ms. Ford's account of the number of people present.Putting aside the utterly suspicious timing of the claim, how is Mr. Kanvanaugh supposed to defend himself against a charge that lacks any specificity whatsoever? How would your husband or son defend himself? If a qualified Supreme Court nominee can be derailed by an 11th-hour, 36-year-old attempted assault allegation that lacks a location, date, time and any witnesses, then the #MeToo movement has become a mockery.Ronda RossAustin, Texas---My heart goes out to Judge Kavanaugh's young daughters and his wife who must live through this nightmare of allegations against their father and husband, respectively, that will forever cloud their lives. The #MeToo movement has gone too far when women use ""women's rights"" as an excuse to push an at best murky narrative of abuse that cannot be remembered in detail by the accuser or confirmed by credible evidence.Sign me up for the #WhatGoesRoundComesRound movement, which I hope catches up with women who carelessly use their gender to destroy the reputation of other human beings.Helen AldersonKennett Square, Pa.---As an 81-year-old woman I can still recall, after 70 years, an attempted sexual assault that happened to me. It is as clear to me now as the night it happened. I don't remember the names of any other families I babysat for, but I shall never forget my assailant's name. If he were alive, I am confident he would say he couldn't recall that anything happened.Most men in no way understand the emotional impact unwanted sexual advances make on females of all ages. Most 17-year-old boys would probably forget or not recall jumping on a girl 36 years ago and trying to rip her clothes off. To them it would have been nothing more than a playful, maybe somewhat inebriated, antic.The men in the Senate who are protecting their nominee are also from the age where men were ignorant (many still are) of the impact unwanted sexual advances have on a woman. I applaud Ms. Ford for coming forward. This wasn't an easy choice for her.Fran KassabianAlameda, Calif.---""The vagaries of memory are well known,"" as you say. Perhaps Mr. Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, who were allegedly quite drunk, had their own memory lapse. Given that scenario, they could conceivably pass a lie detector test as well as Ms. Ford has. There is simply no way to know the truth for sure, and eventually we need to move on.Bruce BowersLos Altos, Calif.---Do you honestly believe that an allegation of sexual assault against a Supreme Court nominee should be glossed over? I've been a therapist for over 40 years and know it is extremely rare that women lie about this because they know the public humiliation Anita Hill endured and that Ms. Ford is about to. Imagine putting your entire sexual history on display on national TV and being grilled by hostile senators willing to say and insinuate anything. Get serious. Things like morality, integrity and honesty are more important than anyone's political career.John LardyTucson, Ariz.---One can debate Sen. Dianne Feinstein's questionable delay or whether Judge Kavanaugh may or may not have participated in some questionable behavior in high school. However, the real issue is whether anyone's stupid behavior in high school or college, short of a violent felony, should be considered when evaluating a person's capability and qualifications for serving in public office or any other position more than 30 years later. Millions of young people have done something stupid or behaved badly during their high school and college years. Most eventually mature and lead exemplary lives thereafter. If we believe in rehabilitation and redemption, we should judge people on their actions during adulthood. If we disqualify every person who behaved stupidly or badly in their youth, we are going to exclude many great people from public life.Stephan WilliamsWorcester, Mass.---This is why fewer than 35% of potential voters actually vote.Nate SachritzPortage, Mich."
wsj,"Sen. Feinstein, Clean Up Your Mess","Republicans and others who live in California and are appalled by the Senate's Brett Kavanaugh spectacle at least can do something about it. In November, they can hold their noses and pull the lever for Dianne Feinstein's ultraliberal challenger and thereby send the state's four-term Senate doyenne down to landslide defeat.Mrs. Feinstein's ending an otherwise a long and creditable career in humiliation and ignominy would be justice not only because of her culpable role in the Kavanaugh travesty. It would be poetic for her to finish under a real and recent cloud given actions that have cast a cloud over Judge Kavanaugh because of unprovable, last-minute claims about how he may have behaved in his teens.Mrs. Feinstein could learn something from the New York Times in its own debunking of the latest ill-sourced Kavanaugh allegation, in which the paper says it contacted dozens of potential witnesses and found none who would verify a complaint floated Sunday in backhanded fashion by the New Yorker magazine.Lesson: You don't need the FBI. Private investigators are available. Opposition researchers can be hired -- just not the Fusion GPS kind, who specialize in producing anonymous, unsubstantiated slurs rather than checking them out.The Senate Judiciary Committee and the Democratic Party have ample resources. In fact, Democrats can still do something to repair the damage, in partnership with Senate Republicans. If Mrs. Feinstein weren't so narrowed by her life in politics that she can't see a bigger picture, she would already have owned up to her failure in this regard and tried to clean up the mess.After all, she is the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. She could refuse to participate in Thursday's hearing. She could demand that it be called off. She could point out the obvious: A hearing in the absence of any attempt by the Senate to seek verifiable facts against which to measure the vague memories of accusant Christine Blasey Ford can only be a ""he said, she said"" travesty, a modern-day gladiatorial contest in which tribal loyalty and the loudest shouting will substitute for truth and justice.Whatever the truth of Mr. Kavanaugh's teenage behavior, this is not a creditworthy exercise in advise and consent. Judge Kavanaugh evidently feels obliged to go along rather than have a refusal be interpreted as guilt. He will be subjected to cross-examination by Senate Democrats in which he will be forced to admit that he drank beer in high school and went to parties. This will be more than enough for Sen. Mazie Hirono, who has already determined that Judge Kavanaugh is a liar because he's a man, and a rapist because as a judge he might uphold democratically enacted restrictions on abortion.Republicans are stuck playing for the mildest possible political disaster, which means pushing through Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation even while the allegations remain unresolved. But Republicans won't, for fear of increasing their jeopardy with women, subject Ms. Ford to the cross-examination that would be requisite in any truly fact-finding forum. They likely won't even challenge her behavior since the allegations surfaced, which has clearly seemed more aimed at conveniencing Democratic strategy in the midterms than at putting her testimony before the senators so they can assess it.Mrs. Feinstein so far has behaved as we expect politicians to behave on most occasions: as if there is no consideration higher than what she must do to assure her re-election. But she's 85 years old. She doesn't need another term in the Senate. She doesn't need one more ritual of incumbency validation.Since the glaring absence here is any context of facts in which her fellow senators can weigh the accusation that Sen. Feinstein allowed to be sprung on Judge Kavanaugh at the last minute, she should be the one to request that the nomination be briefly put on hold. She should propose that Democrats and Republicans jointly sponsor an investigator to take a week or two to question anybody and everybody who might have been present at the alleged party or know anything about the history of Judge Kavanaugh and Ms. Ford.Mrs. Feinstein could even agree, as a gesture of expiation and good faith, to support Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation if the investigation yields no information to support Ms. Ford's claim.Failing that, the right thing to do is spare Judge Kavanaugh and Ms. Ford an awful, purposeless hearing that cannot be anything but a disgrace to the Senate. Republicans should vote up or down based on what is on the record. Ms. Ford is free to tell her story to any senator who wants to hear it. She is free to tell it to the media as many times as she wants; she is not being denied a right to be heard. The media are free to chase down every allegation that she or anybody cares to make about Brett Kavanaugh.All this will not be satisfying, but it wouldn't get more satisfying as the result of Thursday's planned hearing. And at least the Senate will not be an agent of further disgracing itself in the process. Sen. Feinstein is the author of this abomination, whether she meant to be or not, and is the one who ought to call it off."
wsj,GOP Speeds Up Kavanaugh Vote,"The Senate Republican leadership is moving to expedite the final stages of Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court after Thursday's planned hearing featuring the woman who has accused him of sexual assault when they were teenagers.The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a vote Friday on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office alerted senators they should be prepared to work over the weekend, suggesting the chamber could take a procedural vote that would clear the way for a final, full-Senate vote early next week.President Trump wants Judge Kavanaugh to take the seat of retired Justice Anthony Kennedy by Oct. 1, the start of the high court's next term. Republican lawmakers are also pressing to fill the lifetime appointment before the November midterm elections in which they are fighting to maintain their majorities in the House and Senate.""I think that it's going to be pretty hard to move this along without having votes on certainly Friday or Saturday, probably,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah).Christine Blasey Ford, the California college professor who has accused the judge of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school during the 1980s, is set to appear Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Judge Kavanaugh, who has denied Dr. Ford's claims, is also scheduled to appear Thursday before the committee.Democrats are objecting to Republicans pushing forward on the nomination and vote without first having the Federal Bureau of Investigate Dr. Ford's allegations.""Republicans are already talking about rushing to a vote -- before we even got to this hearing, before there is an investigation, and while women are sharing more stories,"" Sen. Patty Murray (D., Wash.) said on Twitter.Committee rules require Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) to issue a public notice of a meeting three days in advance. He also has the right to postpone it, which the committee did earlier this week as negotiations for Thursday's hearing showed progress.Mr. Trump is frustrated by the delay in the vote, a White House official said Tuesday. The president spoke with the Senate majority leader over the weekend, with Mr. McConnell explaining he had to accommodate certain senators who wanted to ensure that Dr. Ford gets a hearing, the official said.It wasn't clear if Republicans have the 50 votes needed to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. Republicans have a 51-49 majority in the Senate. To prevail, they can afford no more than one defection, assuming all Democratic caucus members oppose the nomination. If they lose one vote, they could then have Vice President Mike Pence break a tie.""I am not going to speculate on where I am. Our meetings certainly went well. He certainly has the credentials,"" Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) said Tuesday. ""But we now have a serious allegation made and I look forward to the hearing on Thursday.""Earlier Tuesday, the White House said it was open to congressional testimony from a second woman, who has accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual aggression when he was a college student. There was no indication Senate Republicans would go along with that as a Thursday hearing set to include Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh approached.""We would be open to that, and that process could take place on Thursday,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" when asked whether the president wanted to hear from Deborah Ramirez, a Yale University classmate of the nominee.Ms. Ramirez's attorney, John Clune, told CNN on Tuesday that he was in contact with the Judiciary Committee but that Republicans declined to participate in a call until Ms. Ramirez sent more information. He said his client wants the FBI to investigate the allegations first before she provides more details to lawmakers.Her allegations couldn't be independently verified by The Wall Street Journal. Judge Kavanaugh, who spoke to Senate committee aides about the Ramirez accusation on Tuesday, has denied her claims.In a Fox News interview Monday, Judge Kavanaugh repeated his denials of Dr. Ford's claims and said, ""I've never sexually assaulted anyone. I did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter.""Steve Kantrowitz, a Yale classmate who is now a history professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, questioned that assertion. He wrote on Twitter Tuesday morning, ""Perhaps Brett Kavanaugh was a virgin for many years after high school. But he claimed otherwise in a conversation with me during our freshman year in Lawrance Hall at Yale, in the living room of my suite.""Mr. Kantrowitz said via email Tuesday that he posted the tweet because of the importance of ""honest and integrity"" in serving as a justice, and he remembered the conversation because it was surprising. Kerri Kupec, a White House spokeswoman, said Judge Kavanaugh spoke ""honestly and forthrightly"" in the Fox interview.""The press has been carrying Democrats' and Dr. Ford's narrative,"" a White House official said Tuesday. ""They haven't carried forward the clarity of the judge's denials. We thought having him on TV and presenting that to the country was important. That was the goal and that was what he accomplished.""After viewing the interview, people close to Judge Kavanaugh's nomination are recommending he show more feistiness in the hearing on Thursday and they have made that point to him."
wsj,"Stark Divide, Raw Emotion --- Kavanaugh and Ford give sharply different accounts at Senate committee hearing","Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual misconduct, testified for a more than eight hours in an often-wrenching hearing Thursday that highlighted and exposed many of the nation's raw divisions.The hearing, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, laid bare the enormous stakes as the GOP tries to advance a nomination that would tilt the high court to the right and Democrats push for a thorough investigation into sexual-misconduct allegations in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Hovering over the proceedings were the coming November elections, which will determine control of Congress and the Trump administration's ability to advance its agenda.Shortly after the conclusion of the hearing, President Trump, who has forcefully defended his nominee, described the judge's testimony as ""powerful, honest and riveting"" in a tweet. He also called for the Senate to vote on his nomination and criticized the process as a ""total sham."" Later at a fundraiser, Mr. Trump said Mr. Kavanaugh ""did great.""The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote Friday on the nomination. Republican senators said they expected the full chamber would hold its first procedural vote Saturday, and a final vote is expected early next week.Judge Kavanaugh, fired up with indignation and frequently fighting back tears, defended his personal reputation against the assault allegations, while taking partisan swipes at the panel's Democrats. ""This confirmation process has become a national disgrace,"" he told the committee. ""You have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy.""Earlier in the day, Dr. Ford, a California college professor, her voice halting at times, told lawmakers she had been ""haunted by memories"" since the alleged attack at a house party in the summer of 1982, which she said had left her struggling academically and coping with panic and anxiety for decades.She said she was ""100%"" certain it was Judge Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge who pushed her into a room, and that it was the judge who groped her and tried to remove her clothes. Mr. Judge has said he has no memory of the incident. Dr. Ford, 51 years old, said her memory of ""the laughter, the uproarious laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense"" was ""indelible.""Judge Kavanaugh, 53, has denied the allegations.All eyes now will be on three Republican senators who have said they are concerned by the allegations and haven't committed to backing Mr. Kavanaugh: Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine.Mr. Flake said late Thursday he was still undecided on the Kavanaugh vote. His position is of more immediate import because he is on the Judiciary Committee. Republicans have an 11-10 advantage on the panel, so a single ""no"" vote means the panel would send Judge Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate with a negative recommendation. In the full Senate, Republicans hold a 51-49 advantage, so Judge Kavanaugh can afford no more than one GOP defection if all Democrats vote against him. Ms. Murkowski demurred when asked if she had made up her mind on the nomination. ""I'm going to go home, have some dinner and have a chance to think about all that's gone on today,"" she said.Democrats on Thursday night reiterated their calls to have the FBI investigate the allegations and force Mr. Judge to testify.""Dr. Ford provided compelling testimony today, and all of us were reminded this morning that she came forward with nothing to gain and quite a bit to lose,"" Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement Thursday night. ""Before the Judiciary Committee moves to a final vote, we should pause for a week to seek further investigation and insight into the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh.""The hearing was one of the Capitol's landmark moments, evoking the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas hearings 27 years ago that focused on sexual-harassment claims, and on Thursday television sets and digital screens across the country lit up with the same event. And it wasn't just inside the Beltway: Images shared on social media showed people watching on airplanes, and stock brokers froze to attention at the New York Stock Exchange.Mr. Trump watched the start of the hearings on Air Force One as he flew back to Washington from United Nations meetings in New York. He watched Judge Kavanaugh in the White House residence.The two central figures in the showdown, Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh, didn't watch each other's testimony, according to their representatives.The hearing came just short of one year since the #MeToo movement was launched with the New York Times's first revelations about Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. The movement has cut a swath through the political world, as at least a dozen politicians at the federal level have resigned, lost elections or announced they were retiring in the face of allegations of sexual misconduct.Republicans avoided attacking Dr. Ford directly and set their aim on Democratic lawmakers, accusing them of withholding information about her allegations until the near-final stages of Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing. In response, Democrats repeatedly pressed Judge Kavanaugh to ask for a full Federal Bureau of Investigation look into the matter. The judge didn't commit to pursuing a further investigation.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) at one point blasted Democrats and suggested the accusations against the judge were part of a power grab, telling fellow Republicans that if they voted down Judge Kavanaugh, ""You're legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics.""In later questioning, Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) cited Mr. Graham's comments in asking Judge Kavanaugh: ""Do you think that people who would believe Dr. Ford are legitimizing despicable things?"" Judge Kavanaugh replied by saying, ""Listen to both sides before you make a bottom-line conclusion.""At stake in the hearing was the fate of a Supreme Court pick who could deliver a conservative tilt to the court for decades. The near-term political stakes were also high, as Republicans battle to keep their majorities in the House and Senate this fall.The confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is the top priority for many GOP voters, with filling the federal bench with conservatives a key reason that even those with reservations about Mr. Trump backed him in 2016. Republicans worry that if they can't deliver confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh, it would demoralize GOP voters and depress turnout in a midterm election where their majority hinges on multiple tossup races.But Republicans also run the risk of seeming insensitive to women voters who are already defecting in droves to the Democratic Party's candidates. To limit that risk, they delegated the job of questioning Dr. Ford to an outside counsel, Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, while the Republicans on the panel mostly questioned Judge Kavanaugh themselves."
wsj,"GOP Sticks to Hearing Plan on Nominee --- An attorney for Ford, Kavanaugh's accuser, says more witnesses should be included","WASHINGTON -- Republicans forged ahead with a planned Monday hearing to consider sexual-assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and set a deadline of Friday to determine whether his accuser would appear.White House spokesman Raj Shah said the president won't look at naming any replacement nominee unless there is a clear need. The administration, he said, was going ""full steam ahead"" to support Judge Kavanaugh, who has denied the assault accusations.GOP leaders in the Senate said they were continuing to seek the testimony of Judge Kavanaugh's accuser, California college professor Christine Blasey Ford. Earlier, Republicans rejected calls from her attorneys and Democrats for an investigation of the allegations as a condition for her appearing at the hearing.Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the hearing would start at 10 a.m. Monday, and he pressed Dr. Ford to testify. In a letter to her lawyers, he gave her a deadline of 10 a.m. Friday to submit her biography and prepared remarks if she planned to testify.Lisa Banks, an attorney for Dr. Ford, issued a statement late Wednesday calling for more witnesses to be involved in the hearing -- not just Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford. The statement didn't say whether Dr. Ford would attend the hearing. ""The rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the Committee discovering the truth,"" the attorney wrote.Democrats endorsed Dr. Ford's call for an investigation before a Senate hearing, and they pushed back against what they characterized as a rushed confirmation process.""Professor Ford's request for an FBI investigation is completely reasonable. Senate Republicans want to rush this hearing and have set an arbitrary deadline for Monday,"" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.). ""That's no way to vet these accusations or confirm a lifetime appointment to our highest court.""Republicans have argued that no further FBI background investigation is needed because such inquiries are designed to gather information in a confidential manner and Dr. Ford's accusations are now public. The Federal Bureau of Investigation could reopen its background investigation of Judge Kavanaugh, but that would be up to President Trump to order the agency to do so -- and he has dismissed the idea.Republicans have also said Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford are the only necessary witnesses.Judge Kavanaugh attended meetings at the White House on Monday and Tuesday to prepare for the potential hearing, according to a person familiar with the matter.It wasn't clear how committed Mr. Trump is to the nomination. A person close to Mr. Trump said the president views Judge Kavanaugh as the pick of outgoing White House counsel Don McGahn and ""won't lose any sleep if he has to choose someone else.""At the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he wanted to see Dr. Ford testify but indicated he didn't want to delay the hearing or the nomination for an investigation. Of Judge Kavanaugh, he said: ""He is such an outstanding man. Very hard for me to imagine that anything happened.""Republican leaders want Judge Kavanaugh confirmed by the start of the Supreme Court session on Oct. 1. They delayed a planned committee vote on the nomination this week and offered to hold the hearing Monday with both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford. Her legal team initially said she would be willing to testify. But in a letter Tuesday to Mr. Grassley, her attorneys said they would first require ""a full investigation by law-enforcement officials"" to ""ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a nonpartisan manner.""Mr. Grassley said committee investigators are following up on allegations and no outside investigation is necessary. He said the committee is ""going to continue to try to hear from Dr. Ford in any format she's comfortable"" with, be it an open session, private staff interviews or public staff interviews, ""because her information is very important.""Democrats argued that Republicans, by not delaying the process for a further FBI investigation, aren't committed to getting to the bottom of the assault allegation.""Senate Republicans and the White House should drop their inexplicable opposition to an FBI investigation, allow all the facts to come out, and then proceed with a fair process in the Senate,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.The Senate hasn't set a new date for the Judiciary Committee vote, but time is running short ahead of the new Supreme Court session. If the committee vote on the nomination were held Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could then file for cloture Tuesday. That would start the clock on debate that would then lead to a procedural vote on Thursday and a final, full-Senate confirmation vote by late Friday, Sept. 28, assuming Democrats use all of their allotted time.The new Supreme Court session will proceed with eight members if Judge Kavanaugh isn't confirmed. If the justices were to split 4-to-4 in a case, they could hold it and have it reargued when a ninth member joins the court.Republicans hold a 51-49 advantage in the Senate and can only afford to lose one vote if Democrats vote against the nominee as a bloc. At the same time, several red-state Democrats are also seen as potential ""yes"" votes.On Sunday, Dr. Ford made public her accusations from when she and Judge Kavanaugh were teenagers at a high-school party in the early 1980s. Dr. Ford alleged that Judge Kavanaugh and one of his friends, pulled her into a bedroom, where Judge Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her and attempted to remove her clothing before she escaped. Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegations."
wsj,The #MeToo Kavanaugh Ambush,"The woman accusing Brett Kavanaugh of a drunken assault when both were teenagers has now come forward publicly, and on Monday it caused Republicans to delay a confirmation vote and schedule another public hearing. Yet there is no way to confirm her story after 36 years, and to let it stop Mr. Kavanaugh's confirmation would ratify what has all the earmarks of a calculated political ambush.This is not to say Christine Blasey Ford isn't sincere in what she remembers. In an interview published in the Washington Post on Sunday, Ms. Ford offered a few more details of the story she told anonymously starting in July. She says she was 15 when Mr. Kavanaugh, who would have been 17, and a male friend pushed her into a bedroom at a drinking party, held her down, and pawed her until the male friend jumped on them both and she escaped to a bathroom until the two boys left the room.Mr. Kavanaugh denies all this ""categorically and unequivocally,"" and there is simply no way to prove it. The only witness to the event is Mr. Kavanaugh's high school male friend, Mark Judge, who also says he recalls no such event. Ms. Ford concedes she told no one about it -- not even a high school girl friend or family member -- until 2012 when she told the story as part of couples therapy with her husband.The vagaries of memory are well known, all the more so when they emerge in the cauldron of a therapy session to rescue a marriage. Experts know that human beings can come to believe firmly over the years that something happened when it never did or is based on partial truth. Mistaken identity is also possible.The Post reports that the therapist's notes from 2012 say there were four male assailants, but Ms. Ford says that was a mistake. Ms. Ford also can't recall in whose home the alleged assault took place, how she got there, or how she got home that evening.This is simply too distant and uncorroborated a story to warrant a new hearing or to delay a vote. We've heard from all three principals, and there are no other witnesses to call. Democrats will use Monday's hearing as a political spectacle to coax Mr. Kavanaugh into looking defensive or angry, and to portray Republicans as anti-women. Odds are it will be a circus.---The timing and details of how Ms. Ford came forward, and how her name was coaxed into public view, should also raise red flags about the partisan motives at play. The Post says Ms. Ford contacted the paper via a tip line in July but wanted to remain anonymous. She then brought her story to a Democratic official while still hoping to stay anonymous.Yet she also then retained a lawyer, Debra Katz, who has a history of Democratic activism and spoke in public defense of Bill Clinton against the accusations by Paula Jones. Ms. Katz urged Ms. Ford to take a polygraph test. The Post says she passed the polygraph, though a polygraph merely shows that she believes the story she is telling.The more relevant question is why go to such lengths if Ms. Ford really wanted her name to stay a secret? Even this weekend she could have chosen to remain anonymous. These are the actions of someone who was prepared to go public from the beginning if she had to.The role of Senator Dianne Feinstein is also highly irregular and transparently political. The ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee knew about Ms. Ford's accusations in late July or early August yet kept quiet. If she took it seriously, she had multiple opportunities to ask Judge Kavanaugh or have committee staff interview the principals. But in that event the details would have been vetted and Senators would have had time to assess their credibility.Instead Ms. Feinstein waited until the day before a committee markup on the nomination to release a statement that she had ""information"" about the accusation and had sent it to the FBI. Her statement was a political stunt.She was seeking to insulate herself from liberal charges that she sat on the letter. Or -- and this seems increasingly likely given the course of events -- Senator Feinstein was holding the story to spring at the last minute in the hope that events would play out as they have. Surely she knew that once word of the accusation was public, the press would pursue the story and Ms. Ford would be identified by name one way or another.---Democrats waited until Ms. Ford went public to make public statements. But clearly some were feeding the names of Ms. Ford and her lawyer to the press, and now they are piling on what they hope will be an election-eve #MeToo conflagration.""Senator [and Judiciary Chairman] Grassley must postpone the vote until, at a very minimum, these serious and credible allegations are thoroughly investigated,"" declared Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Sunday. ""For too long, when women have made serious allegations of abuse, they have been ignored. That cannot happen in this case.""His obvious political goal is to delay the confirmation vote past the election, fan the #MeToo political furies until then, and hope that at least two GOP Senators wilt under political pressure. If Republican Senators Jeff Flake andBob Corker think a hearing will satisfy Mr. Schumer, they are right to retire from politics.GOP Senators should understand that the political cost of defeating Mr. Kavanaugh will likely include the loss of the Senate. Democrats are already motivated to vote against Donald Trump, and if Republicans panic now their own voters will rightly be furious. They would be letting Democrats get away with the same dirty trick they tried and failed to pull off against Clarence Thomas.It would also be a serious injustice to a man who has by all accounts other than Ms. Ford's led a life of respect for women and the law. Every #MeToo miscreant is a repeat offender. The accusation against Mr. Kavanaugh is behavior manifested nowhere else in his life.No one, including Donald Trump, needs to attack Ms. Ford. She believes what she believes. This is not he said-she said. This is a case of an alleged teenage encounter, partially recalled 30 years later without corroboration, and brought forward to ruin Mr. Kavanaugh's reputation for partisan purposes.Letting an accusation that is this old, this unsubstantiated and this procedurally irregular defeat Mr. Kavanaugh would also mean weaponizing every sexual assault allegation no matter the evidence. It will tarnish the #MeToo cause with the smear of partisanship, and it will unleash even greater polarizing furies"
wsj,Confirm Brett Kavanaugh,"Thursday's Senate hearing on Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination was an embarrassment that should have never happened. Judge Kavanaugh was right to call the confirmation process a ""disgrace"" in his passionate self-defense, and whatever one thinks of Christine Blasey Ford's assault accusation, she offered no corroboration or new supporting evidence.Ms. Ford certainly was a sympathetic witness -- by her own admission ""terrified"" at the start and appearing to be emotionally fragile. Her description of the assault and its impact on her was wrenching. She clearly believes what she says happened to her. Her allegation should have been vetted privately, in confidence, as she said she would have preferred. Instead ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein held it for six weeks and it was leaked -- perhaps to cause precisely such a hearing circus.Yet there is still no confirming evidence beyond her own testimony, and some of what she says has been contradicted. The female friend Ms. Ford says was at the home the night of the assault says she wasn't there. The number of people she says were there has varied from four to five and perhaps more, but every potential witness she has cited by name says he or she doesn't recall the party.She still can't recall the home where the assault took place, how she got there or how she got home that evening. She has no witnesses who say she told them about the alleged assault at the time -- until she first spoke of it at a couples therapy session 30 years later in 2012. Mr. Kavanaugh's name doesn't appear in the notes of her therapist.As for Judge Kavanaugh, his self-defense was as powerful and emotional as the moment demanded. If he was angry at times, imagine how you would feel if you were so accused and were innocent as he says he is. To deny the allegations as he did -- invoking his children and parents and so many others who know him -- and be lying would mean that he is a sociopath. If he were found to be lying, he would be impeached and probably prosecuted. Nothing in his long record in public life betrays the kind of behavior he is accused of against women.Had he not been as forceful, his opponents would have said he looked guilty. Because he called the Democrats out for their character assassination, the critics now say he lacks the right temperament. The truth is that there is no answer, and no demeanor, that Brett Kavanaugh could offer that the left would credit. Their goal isn't the truth. They want to destroy Judge Kavanaugh.Republican Senators turned over their questioning of Ms. Ford to a trained prosecutor from Arizona, who attempted to clarify facts and fill holes in her testimony. Democrats showed zero interest in getting any facts from Ms. Ford. They spent their question time saying they believed Ms. Ford while badgering Republican Chairman Chuck Grassley to call other witnesses.Yet those potential witnesses have all given sworn statements to Senate staff under penalty of felony that say they don't recall the party or the alleged assault. Hauling them before the Senate wouldn't illuminate the truth any more than Thursday's hearing did.Incredibly, Democrats spent their time with Judge Kavanaugh asking about drinking games and lines in his high school yearbook. Once Senator Lindsey Graham made that look foolish (see below), Democrats focused on their only other argument, which is that the FBI should investigate. But they well know the FBI would merely repeat the interviews they and the Senate Judiciary staff have already done.***The real Democratic goal is to push a confirmation vote past Election Day. They can then spare their incumbents running for re-election from taking a difficult vote. If they win the election, they will then try to block any confirmation until they take over the Senate in January. No nominee to the right of Merrick Garland would then be confirmed in the final two years of the Trump Presidency. The Supreme Court would be divided 4-4 until 2021 at least.Senate Republicans should understand that these are the real political stakes. This nomination isn't only about the fate of a single man whose reputation can be discarded like some tabloid celebrity. This is about the future of the Supreme Court and who will control the Senate. If Republicans reject Mr. Kavanaugh based on what we know now, millions of voters will rightly be furious.But as important, a rejection will bring dishonor to the Senate. It will validate the ambush and smear politics that Democrats are using. And it will turn Supreme Court nominations over to the justice of the social-media mob and the politics of accusation. It's time for Senators to stand up and confirm Brett Kavanaugh."
wsj,Another Kavanaugh Flakeout,"Democrats must be secretly delighted, not that they'll admit it. A couple of GOP Senators fell on Friday for their ruse of seeking an FBI investigation of an assault accusation against Brett Kavanaugh, and now this Supreme Court nomination ordeal will continue for at least another week. Who knows what new dirt against the judge they can throw on the Senate wall?On Friday the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the Supreme Court nominee in an 11-10 party-line vote, with Arizona Senator Jeff Flake the last convert. That should have sent the nomination to the Senate floor and a vote early next week.But then Mr. Flake had a crisis of, well, something and said he wanted another FBI investigation before a floor vote. After Alaska's Lisa Murkowski said she agreed with Mr. Flake, GOP Senate leaders agreed to a one-week FBI probe into current accusations. President Trump obliged and put the FBI on the case again.---The mystery is what new evidence Mr. Flake and Ms. Murkowski expect the FBI to find. The Senate this week heard six hours of public testimony from Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford.The potential witnesses Ms. Ford has named have given statements under penalty of perjury saying they don't recall the 1982 party she describes. No corroboration has materialized, leaving Democrats and the media to pick over high-school yearbook entries from 1983. Ms. Ford said Thursday that she is ""100%"" certain Judge Kavanaugh assaulted her. He told the Senate that he is ""100%"" certain of his innocence.Now the FBI will spend a week redoing all these interviews. To what end? FBI background investigations aren't criminal probes. They reach no conclusions. The agents conduct interviews, record what the subjects say, and put the summaries in a nominee's file. The Senators are then expected to draw their conclusions and vote. After a week Mr. Flake and Ms. Murkowski may find themselves in the same place, since Ms. Ford's charge is too imprecise in date, place or recollections to corroborate.Not that even this extra week will satisfy Democrats -- or Ms. Ford's Democratic handlers. Debra Katz, Ms. Ford's lawyer who was recommended by Democrat Dianne Feinstein, said Friday after news of the delay that ""no artificial limits as to time or scope should be imposed on this investigation.""Look for Democrats and the party's media wing to repeat this like the Rockettes. They're already floating that FBI Director Christopher Wray attended Yale a couple of years after Mr. Kavanaugh did, so, you know, the FBI probe they demanded may also be tainted.The truth is that no amount of investigating by the FBI or anyone else will change a single Democratic vote. And if more accusations arise, no matter how preposterous, Democrats will demand another investigation and more interviews.---Meanwhile, Democrats also received an in-kind political contribution Friday from the head of the American Bar Association, who sent a letter to the Senate calling for an FBI probe and delay. ""The basic principles that underscore the Senate's constitutional duty of advice and consent on federal judicial nominees require nothing less,"" wrote Robert Carlson. Surely it's a coincidence that Mr. Carlson, according to campaign-finance records at OpenSecrets.org, was a donor to Hillary Clinton.Mr. Carlson wants to give the impression that the ABA is walking away from its previous expansive praise for Judge Kavanaugh. The ABA has a Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary that reviews nominees, and on Aug. 30 it gave Judge Kavanaugh its highest rating.This included a glowing report on his character and competence. Dozens of law professors reviewed his writings. Comments were solicited from 471 judges, lawyers and academics. This material was collated into 1,635 pages.The ABA committee then voted unanimously that Judge Kavanaugh is ""well qualified"" for the Supreme Court. Its final report quotes unnamed colleagues and observers: ""His integrity is absolutely unquestioned."" ""He is what he seems, very decent, humble, and honest."" ""He is just the best -- brilliant, a great writer, fair, and he is open-minded.""Mr. Carlson is not a member of that committee, and he is not supposed to speak for the ABA unless the legal group has made a policy decision. In this case he is trying to sandbag his own ABA colleagues. Paul Moxley, the Utah lawyer who chairs the ABA's judicial committee, made that clear on Friday when he wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Mr. Carlson's letter ""was not received"" by his ABA committee ""prior to its issuance."" Mr. Moxley added: ""The ABA's rating for Judge Kavanaugh is not affected by Mr. Carlson's letter.""In other words, Mr. Carlson is free-lancing for partisan purposes and the Senate should ignore him. For the rest of us, however, this is one more reason to bar the ABA from any judicial vetting. Some of us still remember the ABA's shoddy treatment of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.---Sooner or later Republicans have to recognize all of this for the political charade it is. Democrats don't want to find the truth. They want to delay a vote, destroy Judge Kavanaugh's reputation in the meantime, win Senate control in November and then leave the Supreme Court with an empty seat through 2021.If the Senate now wants to give the FBI one more week, Mr. Flake and Ms. Murkowski should spend it getting used to the idea that Mr. Kavanaugh can't prove that something didn't happen. They'll have to vote anyway."
wsj,Brett Kavanaugh's Righteous Anger,"A notable shift occurred in the left's anti-Kavanaugh campaign over the weekend. Attention has turned away from Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault -- the entire reason for last week's hearing and the ensuing delay in Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation vote -- and toward his behavior at the hearing.We're starting to see arguments like the following: Even if Judge Kavanaugh is innocent, what he said at the hearing, and how he said it, is disqualifying.This is rich. The hearing occurred in the first place only because of Democratic duplicity. It occurred only because Senate Democrats sat on Ms. Ford's allegations for six weeks rather than referring them to committee investigators, as they should have done immediately. It occurred only because Ms. Ford's lawyers -- recommended to Ms. Ford by Senate Democrats -- refused to tell their client of our invitation to testify privately in California, as she said she preferred.That Judge Kavanaugh had the temerity to defend himself vigorously is now being counted as a strike against him. Over and over we hear him described as ""angry,"" ""belligerent"" or ""partisan,"" followed by the claim that his conduct at the hearing shows that he lacks a judicial temperament. Even ""Saturday Night Live"" got in on the action.You've got to be kidding me. Do the people making this argument really expect a man who until five seconds ago had an unblemished reputation to sit passively while his reputation is viciously and permanently destroyed? While he is accused of the most horrific and obscene acts imaginable? Judge Kavanaugh's critics seem to be aghast that he is a human being who is unwilling to take slander lying down.Had Judge Kavanaugh sat dispassionately through Thursday's hearing and denied the allegations weakly, his critics would have taken his lack of forcefulness as proof of guilt. We all know this. We're not stupid. Spare us the pearl-clutching.More to the point, this whole ""temperament"" argument is a non sequitur. Obviously Judge Kavanaugh would recuse himself if his own case came before the court. We're told that a man who reacts with understandable indignation when he is falsely accused cannot be a dispassionate arbiter of disputes involving third parties.But we don't need to guess about how Judge Kavanaugh behaves when he's actually on the bench. He has a 12-year track record. And here's what the American Bar Association had to say about him after interviewing more than 100 fellow judges and lawyers who know and have appeared before him: ""Lawyers and judges overwhelmingly praised Judge Kavanaugh's judicial temperament.""Then there's the matter of Judge Kavanaugh's alcohol consumption. Not since Prohibition have so many news outlets reported on drinking habits with such interest.Countless articles have been written about how Judge Kavanaugh ""lied"" about his high-school and college drinking at the hearing, thereby calling into question his honesty. These articles claim the judge portrayed himself as a ""choirboy"" who, in the words of the New York Times, enjoyed ""a beer or two as a high school and college student."" Then they hit back with quotes from college acquaintances who say they saw the judge drink quite a lot.This is known in the business as a straw man. Judge Kavanaugh never claimed he always drank in moderation. To the contrary, he admitted, ""Sometimes I had too many beers."" If Judge Kavanaugh's opponents want to claim he lied about his drinking when he was younger, perhaps they should stop lying about what he actually said.A slightly different straw man concerns Judge Kavanaugh's statements at the hearing that he never blacked out from drinking. The Times and others have gathered testimonials from classmates who say they heard the judge ""slur his words"" and saw him ""staggering"" from alcohol consumption, as if this were proof that he blacked out from drinking. But of course Judge Kavanaugh never denied that he slurred his words or staggered. He said he never blacked out. Even a teetotaling Mormon knows the difference.What's going on here is obvious. Having failed to bring down Judge Kavanaugh with unsubstantiated allegations of sexual abuse, his opponents are now trying to call into question his character in defending himself from those allegations. It's the ultimate set-up job. If the initial charges don't work, we'll destroy him when he defends himself. The good judge is damned no matter what he does.This is further evidence that this whole sordid saga was never about the truth. It was never about justice for Ms. Ford. It was always and only about defeating Judge Kavanaugh by any means necessary. If the claims about sexual assault -- a serious and important topic that deserves respectful consideration, not this farce -- fail to stick, we'll take him down with straw men about drinking and nitpicking about yearbooks.The latest claim is that Judge Kavanaugh lied when he testified that he first learned about Deborah Ramirez's allegations of lewd conduct from ""the New Yorker story."" NBC News reports he might have discussed the matter with fellow Yale alumni before the story's publication. In fact, he testified he'd heard ""that she was calling around to classmates trying to see if they remembered"" the events she described. The New Yorker quotes him denying the allegations -- so it seems a fair conclusion he learned of the precise claim from the New Yorker story as it was being prepared for publication.He also reportedly threw ice at someone in a bar in 1985. So there's that.I for one have had enough of this charade. Judge Kavanaugh is a good man and a good judge who doesn't deserve this treatment or anything like it. What he does deserve is confirmation."
wsj,The Kavanaugh Standard,"Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to replace Anthony Kennedy on the U.S. Supreme Court is a watershed event that will define America's politics for years. If the Kavanaugh nomination fails because of the accusations made against him by Christine Blasey Ford and others, America's system of politics, indeed its everyday social relations, will be conducted in the future on the Kavanaugh Standard. It will deepen the country's divisions for a generation.The Kavanaugh Standard will hold that any decision requiring a deliberative consideration of contested positions can and should be decided on just one thing: belief. Belief is sufficient. Nothing else matters.Rape is already a prosecutable crime. Definitions of sexual harassment are undergoing a reconsideration that may yet produce new legal standards to determine liability or suitability for employment. Right now, we are not close to a consensus.Once the decades-old accusations had been made against Judge Kavanaugh, with no corroboration available or likely, the Senate Judiciary Committee had no practical or formal basis for enlarging the discussion about his nomination. For everyone, the way forward was into a fog.Then something new happened. Half of the Senate Judiciary Committee created this standard: ""I believe Christine.""It is an inescapable irony that the Kavanaugh Standard -- ""I believe"" -- is being established inside the context of a nomination to the highest U.S. court. This new standard for court nominees (and surely others in and outside politics) would be that judgment can be rendered in the absence of substantive argument or any legal standard relating to corroboration, cross-examination or presumption of innocence.In fact, the Kavanaugh Standard would have less intellectual content than liberalism's previous judicial gold standard -- agreement with the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. The new, operative standard, assuming two Republican senators abandon Judge Kavanaugh, will come down to a leap of faith.For a political cynic, like Chuck Schumer or Dianne Feinstein, all these considerations are pointless and irrelevant. Just win, baby. A bloodless political actor such as Sen. Schumer would say: Look, if there's a problem of some sort with compromised legal standards, we can make adjustments later. They won't do that.If Democrats regain control of Congress and the presidency, this is how they will govern -- with belief alone sufficient as justification for imposing policy.Something like a politics-by-belief emerged with the Obama presidency's remarkable number of broadly applicable executive orders issued by the Labor, Education and Justice departments and the Environmental Protection Agency. But even these orders, however coercive, permitted challenge as a misreading of available facts. The defeat of this Supreme Court nominee would be simply asserted. It would have about as much political legitimacy as a one-man-rule decree.I have been wondering what the rest of the nation's sitting judges are making of the Kavanaugh proceedings. Or more specifically, what Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan think of what they imply for the future of the law's role in the U.S.Looking at what has happened recently to university professors accused and then abandoned by their schools and colleagues for alleged racial offenses, or at the spectrum of proof in GBP MeToo incidents, it is clear that the political and academic left are contesting centuries-old standards of evidence.Liberal jurisprudence and its arguments with conservatives, for example over Fourth Amendment search cases, is being displaced by a Democratic left -- there is no other way to describe it -- that prefers rough justice.Rough justice is what the political left and the media left, notably the New Yorker and New York Times, is meting out to Brett Kavanaugh. Hawaii's Sen. Mazie Hirono has emerged from this hearing as a hero of the new rough justice.Professors at Yale Law School canceled classes this week so that much of the student body could travel to Washington to support Ms. Ford's allegations, which suggests that the most popular class at Yale these days must be ""Legal Principles from the Stone Age to the 10th Century."" It's not a joke. In 20 years, a President Ocasio-Cortez will be naming these advocates of faith-based reasoning to the federal appeals courts.In a more conciliatory atmosphere, one might say that even if the claims of a high-school offense were true, surely there is a case in adulthood for forgiveness. But these are unforgiving times, and that virtue is out the window.Ultimately, this drama comes down to the choices about to be made by Republican Sens. Jeff Flake, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. The question is whether the Senate's advice and consent for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court should be reduced to simple secular belief. More important is that the entire country is watching now, and we'll find out soon what the American system of law is going to look like for the next 25 years."
wsj,Kavanaugh Probe Nears Its End,"WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pressed Tuesday to hold a vote as soon as possible on Judge Brett Kavanaugh, with the FBI expected to wrap up its probe into allegations of sexual assault and misconduct by the Supreme Court nominee as soon as Wednesday.Mr. McConnell was vague on the timing of his next steps. While he made clear the FBI's findings wouldn't derail plans for a vote, he retained flexibility to address the concerns of three undecided GOP senators -- Jeff Flake of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.Given the GOP's thin Senate majority, Mr. McConnell would need support of two of those three lawmakers if all Democrats vote against the judge.""What I can tell you with certainty -- we'll have an FBI report this week, and we'll have a vote this week,"" Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, told reporters.At a political rally in Mississippi late Tuesday, President Trump mocked the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, a research psychologist who alleged Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a Maryland house party when they were teenagers. Judge Kavanaugh, now 53 years old, has categorically denied the allegation.It was the first time the president has aimed direct public criticism at Dr. Ford.""How did you get home?"" Mr. Trump asked, mimicking a questioner during last week's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. ""I don't remember,"" Mr. Trump said in mock response of Dr. Ford.One of Dr. Ford's lawyers, Michael Bromwich, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Trump's comments were ""a vicious, vile and soulless attack.""The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman sent a letter Tuesday to Dr. Ford's attorneys asking for evidence buttressing her claim of sexual assault, writing that her allegations have ""put Judge Kavanaugh on trial before the nation.""In his letter, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) said that Dr. Ford's attorneys have withheld evidence that senators need to evaluate the allegations before voting on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination.He requested material covering three separate areas: notes from Dr. Ford's therapy sessions; recordings of the lie detector test she took; and exchanges she had with the news media.Dr. Ford's lawyers didn't respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.The letter raises a separate issue involving Dr. Ford's truthfulness. When she testified at the Judiciary Committee hearing last week, Dr. Ford was asked if she had ever talked to anyone beside her attorneys on how to take a lie-detector test.""Never,"" she said.Asked if she had discussed with anyone tips in taking a polygraph, she said, ""No.""In seeking the lie detector records, Mr. Grassley said that the committee had gotten a sworn statement from an unnamed former boyfriend of Dr. Ford. The statement was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.The writer, whose name was redacted, said that he dated Dr. Ford from 1992 to 1998, found her to be ""truthful"" and that he had no ill will toward her.He said that while they were dating, Dr. Ford lived with a female friend. That person was interviewing for a federal job. The writer said he witnessed Dr. Ford help her friend prepare to take a lie-detector test.Because of her background in psychology, the writer said, Dr. Ford was able to help her friend understand ""what to expect, and how polygraphs worked,"" putting her mind at ease about the forthcoming test.In his letter, Sen. Grassley wrote that Dr. Ford's testimony at the hearing ""raises specific concerns about the reliability of her polygraph examination results. The Senate therefore needs this information.""On Tuesday, Mr. McConnell sidestepped questions on how long senators would have to review the Federal Bureau of Investigation's findings and when he would hold a required procedural vote to set up the final confirmation.It remained unclear whether the public would have access to the FBI findings. Mr. McConnell said only senators would be able to see them, but his No. 2, Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas), said ""there does need to be some sort of public statement, if not the reports themselves.""The Democrats' Senate leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, called for the FBI to brief senators on their findings at least 24 hours before a vote.""Why are our Republican colleagues so afraid of making this public?"" he said. ""Almost every step they take, it seems they have something to hide."" Democrats are pushing for the probe's results to be public.By Tuesday evening, FBI agents had interviewed three people who Dr. Ford said were at the gathering on the night of her alleged assault. The bureau had also questioned two friends of Judge Kavanaugh referenced in a 1982 calendar, Tim Gaudette and Chris Garrett, known as ""Squi,"" according to their lawyers. Judge Kavanaugh's calendar indicated that on July 1, 1982, he went to ""Timmy's"" house for ""skis w/Judge, Tom, PJ, Bernie, Squi,"" which he told lawmakers was a reference to brewskis, or beers, at Mr. Gaudette's home.The FBI has also spoken to Deborah Ramirez, a Yale University classmate who told the New Yorker that Mr. Kavanaugh exposed himself to her when they were in college. The judge has denied that allegation.Ms. Ramirez's attorney said Tuesday that the FBI spoke to his client for more than two hours on Sunday, but that he was concerned that investigators hadn't yet contacted the more than 20 people Ms. Ramirez had told them could corroborate her account.Democrats have made it clear they are likely to raise questions about the scope of the probe if they believe it is incomplete.Mr. Trump, while praising the nominee, has said the FBI should conduct a comprehensive probe and that its findings could affect his support. He said it wouldn't be ""acceptable"" if it emerged that Judge Kavanaugh had lied to Congress.The president had been advised not the criticize Dr. Ford and had displayed restraint after her testimony last week before the Judiciary Committee.But on Tuesday night at the rally in Mississippi, Mr. Trump criticized gaps in Dr. Ford's retelling of the alleged sexual assault at a house party in a Maryland suburb of Washington in the early 1980s.""How'd you get there? I don't remember. . . . Where is the place? . . . I don't remember . . . How many years ago was it? I don't know,"" Mr. Trump said, mocking Dr. Ford's testimony as the crowd cheered.""Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don't know. But I had one beer. That's the only thing I remember.""Dr. Ford couldn't recall certain details, but she testified that she was ""100 percent"" certain that Judge Kavanaugh was her attacker, which he vehemently denies.Mr. Bromwich, Dr. Ford's attorney, wrote on Twitter after Mr. Trump's remarks: ""Is it any wonder that she was terrified to come forward, and that other sexual assault survivors are as well? She is a remarkable profile in courage. He is a profile in cowardice."""
wsj,FBI Probe Delays Kavanaugh Vote,"WASHINGTON -- The fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh took another unexpected turn Friday when Sen. Jeff Flake forced a delay of up to one week on a Senate vote toallow the FBI time to investigate decades-old allegations of sexual assault against the judge.In a tumultuous day, Mr. Flake (R., Ariz.) both provided the key vote to advance Judge Kavanaugh through the Judiciary Committee and used a threat of later withholding his support to force GOP leaders to slow the confirmation process.""This country is being ripped apart here, and we have to be sure we're doing due diligence,"" Mr. Flake said at the hearing, ending frenzied negotiations that saw lawmakers slipping off the committee dais to head into a nearby anteroom corridor to join the conversations.By day's end, a White House that had been ""shellshocked"" by Friday's events, according to a person close to the confirmation team, acquiesced. Speaking alongside the president of Chile, President Trump said he would do ""whatever they think is necessary"" to keep the Kavanaugh nomination alive.Hours later, Mr. Trump ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to conduct a ""supplemental investigation"" that would be limited to credible allegations of sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh and conclude in less than a week.The latest twist means Judge Kavanaugh likely won't see a Senate vote until at least the end of next week, leaving about a month before midterm elections, after which the political dynamic may shift. That provides a backdrop of fierce political partisanship, with each side using Judge Kavanaugh's nomination to fuel enthusiasm and turnout for the midterms.Democrats are seen as favorites to win control of the House, and they could challenge for control of the Senate as well. That possibility has Democrats accusing Republicans of rushing to confirm Judge Kavanaugh now, and Republicans saying Democrats are dragging out the process long enough to scotch the nominee's chances.Mr. Flake was able to impose his will because of the Republicans' narrow Senate advantage, 51 to 49, and he wasn't alone. The White House can afford only one Republican defection in the confirmation vote, assuming all Democrats vote against him. Mr. Flake was joined later by GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine in insisting on the FBI review of California college professor Christine Blasey Ford's claim that the judge assaulted her when they were teenagers.""At the end of the day, it is the undecided senators who most hold the key here,"" Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) said. Democrats have been calling for a further FBI review of the allegations, and Mr. Coons had suggested a one-week delay in his remarks Friday before the Judiciary panel, which he said he had revised in an effort to appeal to Mr. Flake.In testimony that riveted the Capitol and much of the nation Thursday, Dr. Ford said that an inebriated Mr. Kavanaugh and a friend locked her in a bedroom during an early 1980s party, groped her and tried to remove her clothes. She said she managed to get away but the alleged assault left her struggling academically and coping with anxiety for years.A defiant Judge Kavanaugh later Thursday rebutted her allegations, saying he was too busy with sports and other summertime events to party hard and that he was likely out of town when the alleged assault occurred.Mr. Flake had arrived at the Senate Judiciary Committee prepared to support Judge Kavanaugh, according to a statement released by his office. Moments later, on his way to the committee hearing room, he was confronted by protesters as he entered an elevator.In a video widely shared on social media and on cable news channels, Maria Gallagher, 23 years old, tearfully told the senator that she was the victim of a sexual assault. ""Nobody believed me,"" she said, as Mr. Flake listened with his head bowed. ""You're telling all women in America that they don't matter.""At the White House, aides as of Thursday night were upbeat about Judge Kavanaugh's combative defense of the allegations, the person close to the confirmation team said. Then, late Thursday, the American Bar Association in a letter urged the Judiciary Committee to vote on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination only after a ""thorough"" FBI investigation. After that, the person said, ""It kind of fell apart.""It wasn't clear what would be involved in the FBI investigation beyond Dr. Ford's allegation.Two other women have alleged sexual misconduct connected with Judge Kavanaugh, which he has denied. Deborah Ramirez alleged in a New Yorker article that Mr. Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken party when they were both freshmen at Yale University. And earlier this past week, Julie Swetnick alleged Mr. Kavanaugh was at a party in the early 1980s when she was gang-raped and that he tried to get women drunk at several gatherings so they could be targeted for an attack.A lawyer for Ms. Swetnick said his client would cooperate. ""We are anxious to meet with the FBI, which is what we have been demanding,"" said the lawyer, Michael Avenatti. A lawyer for Ms. Ramirez didn't return a request for comment."
wsj,"Brett Kavanaugh, Presumption and Fairness","Regarding your editorial ""The Politics of Destruction"" (Sept. 25): An accused is entitled to due process when the state contemplates taking away the accused's rights. The opportunity to become a Supreme Court justice is a privilege, not a right. You do a disservice applying a rights-based notion to a privilege situation.When we grant privilege amid controversy, we are all free to apply the benefit of the doubt as we choose and to encourage others to adopt our standard.Jonathan A. GoodmanBoulder, Colo.---What is even more pernicious than the new standard of the presumption of guilt is the selective presumption of guilt. Accusers of those who hold particular real or perceived political leanings that don't jibe with left-leaning groupthink are both believed and lauded for their courage upon making nothing more than a completely unsubstantiated charge, while those who accuse favored, left-leaning political actors, often with detailed facts and evidence, are ignored. The targeting of and dismissal of Bill Clinton's accusers is legion in this regard.This type of behavior that assassinates well-established moral and legal principles, along with the character assassination of perceived enemies, is now situated almost entirely within the progressive movement that has infected the larger Democratic Party. This unjust cudgel is an early feature of all totalitarianism wherein individual rights erode for the disfavored while being elevated for the favored.James GottschalkTequesta, Fla.---Before Democrats finally revealed that an anonymous claim of sexual misconduct was made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh based on an alleged incident 36 years ago, 33% of American voters supported his nomination to the Supreme Court, with 29% opposed. The WSJ/NBC poll last week (after Christine Blasey Ford came forward) showed 34% in support and 38% opposed.Even if Judge Kavanaugh survives this liberal trial by ordeal and squeaks by to serve on the Supreme Court, the ""J'accuse"" tactic will have worked politically, particularly if the Democrats go on to win control of Congress in the midterm elections.Dave PalmerColumbia, S.C.---The same ""progressives"" who decried the practice of racial profiling are now engaging in gender profiling, i.e., if he is a man, then he is assumed guilty of sexual assault unless proved innocent. This practice has now entered the public arena.Allen WeitznerAventura, Fla.---The letters of Sept. 21 included one from the honest 81-year-old woman who told of the attempted sexual assault she so unfortunately endured when she was 11. She states: ""It is as clear to me now as the night it happened."" She makes the point victims of such horrible, unwanted sexual advances have vivid, specific memories. According to what her attorney tells us, Christine Blasey Ford does not. Thanks to Fran Kassabian for elucidating that point.Mary DuCoinStuart, Fla.---Forget Brett Kavanaugh.

wsj,Kavanaugh: An Easy Vote,"This is not hard. Democrats and the media have worked ceaselessly to create the impression that Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation vote is the toughest the Senate will ever take. It isn't. Not even close.True, by using some of the most vicious, ruthless and soulless tactics ever seen in Washington, the left has managed to escalate this moment. But step back, wipe the mud from your eyes, and view this nomination again with 20/20 vision. It's an easy vote.Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most respected jurists in the country, with 12 years and hundreds of opinions on the nation's pre-eminent court of appeals. He has served his country ably and with distinction for decades. He is the definition of a bright, solid conservative jurist, a natural pick for any Republican president -- a George W. Bush, a John McCain, a Mitt Romney. Voting for a stellar judge universally praised across the establishment? Easy.Senators should remember that he was chosen in part for these specific credentials -- to spare more-moderate Republicans the debates over abortion and other touchy subjects that might have accompanied different nominees. The entire process has been marked by deference to those moderates -- from White House pre-nomination consultations to a rock-solid confirmation process that was the most transparent in history.Judge Kavanaugh endured 31 hours of initial hearings and answered nearly 1,300 subsequent written questions. He met 65 senators. The Judiciary Committee made available to senators thousands of documents spanning his career in government service. All this was done to ensure an orderly, thorough and honest process. Voting for a man who has been more thoroughly vetted than any nominee in history? Easy.Republicans can also point to a fair and exhaustive examination of the ugly allegations lodged at the last minute against the nominee. Christine Blasey Ford's claims were immediately investigated by the Judiciary Committee. She was provided a hearing and treated with utmost courtesy. At senators' requests, the vote was delayed and the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted a seventh Kavanaugh background check, this one into the claims of Ms. Ford and Deborah Ramirez. The resulting report confirms the allegations are entirely uncorroborated, and the people the accusers claim were present deny any knowledge of the purported events. Voting for a man who is innocent under any standard of due process? Easy.The new claim that Judge Kavanaugh lacks the ""temperament"" to sit on the court is likewise untethered from reality. When he appeared at last week's hearing, he was not testifying in his capacity as a judge, a federal employee or even a lawyer. He was testifying as a human being -- one falsely accused by Senate Democrats of gang rape. Of course he was indignant. But whatever his reaction, it bears no relation to his judicial temperament, to how he conducts himself on the bench. On that score his record is beyond reproach. The ABA interviewed hundreds of people about him and reported: ""Lawyers and judges overwhelmingly praised Judge Kavanaugh's judicial temperament."" Voting for a man who is described in that report as ""honest,"" ""humble,"" ""open-minded,"" ""decent"" and ""fair""? Easy.Politically, too, this is easy. Republican voters are furious about the treatment of Judge Kavanaugh and want him confirmed. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll this week showed the Democratic ""enthusiasm"" edge in the midterms has evaporated. As many Republicans as Democrats now say this election is ""very important"" -- which directly ties to the Kavanaugh battle. Recent polls show Democratic senators from red states who have declared against Judge Kavanaugh to be in growing political peril -- from North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp to Missouri's Claire McCaskill to Montana's Jon Tester. Any Republican who votes against this judge puts himself in the same camp as Dianne Feinstein, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, and risks turning that voter wrath onto themselves.Don't tell the ""resistance,"" but the hard vote to defend would be a ""no."" That's the vote that would legitimize these shameful tactics and guarantee similar gruesome treatment for future nominees. That's the vote that turns GBP MeToo into GBP MeCarthyism. It's the vote that potentially removes Judge Kavanaugh from even his existing position, as Democrats pursue perjury charges and impeachment. A ""no"" is a vote against every value Republican senators claim to hold dear -- due process, the presumption of innocence, civility, conservative jurisprudence, the Senate's solemn role in advice and consent.Democrats want Republicans to fear this vote. Republicans should embrace it. Because it is the right thing to do, and because the Supreme Court rulings that will come with a Justice Kavanaugh will serve as a point of pride for decades to come."
wsj,The Attack on Kavanaugh Is Un-American,"A reputation is a fragile thing. Last week was a testament to that simple truth. Within hours of being accused of an unsubstantiated and uncorroborated three-decades-old assault, Judge Brett Kavanaugh's reputation as a highly respected jurist with an unblemished personal record was permanently damaged. Many rushed to declare Judge Kavanaugh guilty merely because he had been accused. Democrats all too happily called for him to withdraw his Supreme Court nomination, while his accuser's lawyer basked in the left's glory for slowing a Supreme Court nomination that seemed a sure thing.As the #MeToo tidal wave crests, it is crucial to remember what happens when we blindly assume the truth of allegations rather than require evidence and adhere to the notion that people are innocent until proven guilty. I have seen firsthand what happens when people mindlessly follow preconceived narratives, disregard evidence, and indiscriminately believe accusers. I represented Nicole Eramo, a dean at the University of Virginia, who was victimized by one of the most notorious false rape accusations in recent history.Rolling Stone magazine claimed in 2014 that Ms. Eramo had tried to cover up a horrific gang rape at a UVA fraternity. The campus exploded in protest, and Ms. Eramo -- who had dedicated her career to helping survivors of sexual assault and had supported the purported victim -- became a national villain, receiving public condemnation and death threats.Although we were ultimately able to vindicate Ms. Eramo publicly, winning a $3 million jury verdict for defamation, we faced the tremendously difficult task of proving what had not happened: that the reported gang rape did not occur, and that Ms. Eramo did not dismiss the accuser's allegations. That required months of litigation -- not to mention the public backlash my law firm endured by daring to ask a purported victim of sexual assault questions about her allegations.Judge Kavanaugh finds himself in a similar unenviable position: being expected to prove a negative. To vindicate himself in the eyes of those who assume his guilt, he must show that something else happened, for example that he was somewhere else when the incident -- whose location is itself unspecified -- allegedly occurred. To make matters worse, the purported assault took place before cellphones, text messages, emails -- making it hard to find contemporaneous documents to demonstrate the falsity of the claim.That's precisely why Democrats have latched onto these allegations -- because they are unprovable. It is her word against his. And how dare a white man, from a privileged background, confront his accuser -- either himself or through his lawyer. Even if that lawyer is a woman. The left tells us that to do so would be ""insensitive"" and would ""revictimize"" her. But with that approach, due process is thrown out the window, all law is politics, and mob rule becomes the standard. It is un-American, and all Americans should be fearful.Senate Republicans should not have invited Christine Blasey Ford to testify without first requiring her to answer written questions under oath and produce any documents supporting her claims. The polygraph results were finally released Wednesday, but where are those therapist notes? What questions was Ms. Ford asked, and how did she answer them, in each of those settings? What do others -- witnesses either to the alleged assault or to Ms. Ford's recounting of it -- have to say about it under oath?An adversarial process -- with testimony by relevant witnesses supported by contemporaneous documents -- is the best way to make a determination about Ms. Ford's and Judge Kavanaugh's credibility. A he-said-she-said back-and-forth without documents or witnesses will produce nothing except political theater.Senate Republicans and Democrats -- along with the American public -- should remember that in civil and criminal settings, the prosecution bears the burden of proof. The Senate Judiciary Committee in its advice-and-consent role for Supreme Court nominations should not disregard this bedrock principle of American jurisprudence -- it should firmly embrace it. Unless Ms. Ford can satisfy her burden of proof by calling witnesses with contemporaneous knowledge of her claims or producing relevant documents supporting her allegations, Judge Kavanaugh should be presumed innocent and his nomination should be confirmed.At this point, all we know is that every purported witness denies any knowledge of the party where the assault is supposed to have happened -- including a female friend of Ms. Ford's, who says she doesn't even know Judge Kavanaugh. Ms. Ford, through her Democratic lawyer, Debra Katz, has only referenced -- or produced portions of -- very self-serving documents. The American people should be permitted to hear from these witnesses and to review these documents. And they are entitled to answers to other relevant questions to determine whether this is -- as many Republicans suspect -- merely a political hatchet job.When did Ms. Ford retain Ms. Katz? Who referred Ms. Ford to Ms. Katz? If this is not a political attack, why did she choose Ms. Katz as her lawyer? What communications did she, or Ms. Katz, have with Senate Democrats before publicly making these allegations? Why did Ms. Ford report her allegation to a Democratic politician, rather than to local law enforcement or to the FBI?The controversy erupting around the Kavanaugh nomination underlines the power of the #MeToo movement, which is predicated on the idea that the dynamics between the sexes rob women of their power. But anyone still holding to that Victorian notion should have been disabused of it last week.The circus this process has become demonstrates not only the power of #MeToo but also its potential as a weapon -- and how an audience eager for victim narratives and sinister power dynamics can be galvanized without proof to shatter a man's reputation built over a lifetime of hard work. When preconceived narratives replace the demand for facts and evidence, accusations become self-proving. Don't be surprised when people with ulterior motives invent false accusations that destroy the innocent."
wsj,How Kavanaugh Could Help the GOP,"Following last week's extraordinary testimony by Prof. Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett Kavanaugh, public attitudes are split and malleable.The hearing eroded support for Judge Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation, according to a Sept. 30 Harvard-Harris poll. Before the hearing, 36% of voters favored his confirmation with 38% opposed and 26% undecided. After the hearing, support for confirmation was roughly unchanged, but opposition ticked up to 44% as the share of undecideds fell. Responses broke along partisan lines: Republicans favored confirmation 72% to 13%, while Democrats opposed it 71% to 16%. Independents also opposed confirmation, 45% to 28%.But the tide of opinion could reverse after the Federal Bureau of Investigation finishes its supplemental background check. The Harvard-Harris survey also asked respondents where they would stand if the FBI review ""finds no corroboration"" of Ms. Ford's accusations. In that case, support for confirming Judge Kavanaugh rises to 60% -- including 58% among independents -- while opposition drops to 40%.This is why Democrats -- who demanded an FBI investigation -- are likely to disparage it once it concludes. They will argue it was rushed even though Sen. Amy Klobuchar initially said ""let's give this one week"" and Sen. Mazie Hirono said over the weekend ""there is time to get to the bottom of it, even if it's seven days."" In a Sept. 20 letter to the White House, Democratic senators noted that ""the FBI finished its work in three days"" when investigating accusations against Clarence Thomas in 1991.But Sen. Richard Blumenthal has already called the FBI's time frame ""too accelerated and too artificial."" After Democrats warned the White House not to influence the FBI's work, Mr. Blumenthal now demands the FBI question 25 people. Once the investigation wraps up, Democrats may insist on another televised hearing. Others will drop the sexual-assault issue and turn to teenage drinking and yearbook scribbles to suggest Judge Kavanaugh misled the Judiciary Committee.Democrats aren't the only ones revved up by all this. The Harvard-Harris poll found 46% of Republicans along with 50% of Democrats agreed ""the battle over Brett Kavanaugh"" made them ""more likely to turn out and vote in this November's midterm elections."" Republicans have generally been less enthusiastic than Democrats, but they may have been jolted into action by this controversy.The GOP could strengthen its hand further -- especially with independents -- by keeping the focus on how Democrats created this mess. Sixty-nine percent of all voters -- not just Republicans -- believe ""the Senate confirmation hearings ... have been a national disgrace."" Seventy-five percent of voters agree Sen. Dianne Feinstein should ""have immediately turned over the letter from Christine Blasey Ford"" rather than sit on it for six weeks until it was leaked in the media. Note to California Republicans, left without a Senate candidate by the state's open primary: Vote for Mrs. Feinstein's Democratic opponent, Kevin de Leon. The better his showing in California's red precincts, the bigger the rebuke to Mrs. Feinstein.How will this ugly confirmation fight affect the midterms? In crucial Senate races in red states like Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia, it will hurt Democrats. There are simply a lot more Republicans than Democrats in these states, and Republicans support Judge Kavanaugh. That's why North Dakota's Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, West Virginia's Sen. Joe Manchin and Tennessee hopeful Phil Bredesen, all Democrats, have yet to join their party's mob trying to destroy the nominee.Two other red-state Democratic senators, Missouri's Claire McCaskill and Montana's Jon Tester, oppose the judge, but offered reasons other than Ms. Ford's accusations. Indiana's Joe Donnelly may find himself in a pickle. He came out against Judge Kavanaugh over Ms. Ford's claim and said it ""should be investigated by the FBI."" But if the FBI cannot corroborate the accusations, Mr. Donnelly can be hammered for rushing to judgment on Mr. Kavanaugh without waiting for the evidence he asked for.In purple states such as Arizona, Florida and Nevada, this issue will cut more evenly between the parties. GOP candidates there must emphasize that the hearings were a mess that could have been avoided if Mrs. Feinstein turned over Ms. Ford's letter promptly. That way her privacy could have been protected and the charges examined in the FBI's normal process.It would have been better for Ms. Ford, Judge Kavanaugh and the country if regular order had been followed. But Democrats refused. Now America will have to live with the ugly consequences, which will only be made worse if a good man is kept from the bench by an uncorroborated charge promoted by a party that specializes in last-minute character assassination."
wsj,U.S. News: Kavanaugh Vote to Test Murkowski,"ANCHORAGE -- The nomination fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is testing the independent streaks of several moderate senators, including Alaska's Lisa Murkowski whose extraordinary, write-in re-election victory eight years ago has left her less shackled to the party hierarchy.Ms. Murkowski this week dismissed demands to act quickly on the nomination. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has said that he plans to vote soon after the expected release of a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into allegations of sexual assault and misconduct leveled against the nominee.""He talked about a vote last week, too,"" Ms. Murkowski said.To prevail, Mr. McConnell can lose only one Republican if all Democrats oppose the nominee, who has denied the allegations against him. Three Republicans are undecided: Ms. Murkowski as well as Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine.While Ms. Collins and Mr. Flake have been in the spotlight, particularly because of his decision to broker a Judiciary Committee deal to allow time for the FBI probe, Ms. Murkowski has been able to minimize attention in Washington.In an interview Tuesday with Alaska Public Media, Ms. Murkowski called the volume of constituent feedback unprecedented. ""All of the voice-mail boxes are literally filled within the first hour,"" she said. ""We've hired additional staff to do nothing more than sort through the volume of calls that have come in overnight.""Her final decision on the nomination is complicated because it touches many forces that animate her politics. Ms. Murkowski, 61, has a history of prioritizing women's causes, and polls show a sharp gender gap in which a plurality of women oppose Judge Kavanaugh while men support him. But as one of the last remaining swing votes, she also uses her power cautiously, tending to break with her party only to help Alaska. That was the case when she voted against a GOP attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act partly because of threatened Medicaid cuts and against school-choice advocate Betsy DeVos to run the Education Department because of threats to rural public-school budgets. The Republican senator stayed with the herd when the GOP last year drove through a sweeping, $1.5 trillion tax cut.""Lisa is on this kind of teeter-totter,"" said Ivan Moore, an Anchorage polling expert. ""Whenever it totters too much to one side, she throws some red meat to the other side.""In Alaska, the battle for her vote is becoming pitched. On the left, her office has been barraged with emails, letters and calls from unions, tribes, women's groups and others opposing Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation on multiple grounds. This week, about 100 women representing the groups were scheduled to make the 3,400-mile flight to Washington to register their views in person.""She voted the right way on health care and we want to make sure she does so again,"" said Kim Hays, deputy political director for the Alaska AFL-CIO, which opposes Judge Kavanaugh partly on the basis of past rulings in which the group says he often sided with employers over workers.Meanwhile, 39 leaders of the Alaska Republican Party signed a letter to Ms. Murkowski asking that she vote in favor of the judge at a meeting last month in Wasilla.""I will be sorely disappointed if she doesn't, and shocked,"" said Tuckerman Babcock, chairman of the state party.The push-and-pull has given Ms. Murkowski leverage. She owes little to the GOP establishment; she was left for dead in her 2010 race, when she lost a Republican primary but mounted a successful write-in campaign with the help of traditional Democratic constituencies like women and Alaska Natives.A survey completed on Sept. 25 by Mr. Moore's Alaska Survey Research found she has a higher approval rating among Democrats than Republicans, in large part because she is a centrist Republican in a state party dominated by conservatives. Mr. Moore's survey of likely Alaska voters found 46.5% of them would like for Ms. Murkowski to vote yes on Judge Kavanaugh while 43.4% said no and 10% were undecided.So far, Ms. Murkowski's influence has been most visible in her decision to join Sens. Flake and Collins to insist on a supplemental FBI investigation into sexual-assault allegations raised by Christine Blasey Ford. Dr. Ford said Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers and he was drunk. He has denied the allegation."
wsj,The Continuing Saga of Judge Kavanaugh,"Regarding your editorial ""Another Kavanaugh Flakeout"" (Sept. 29) and other Journal opinion pieces: Watching Christine Blasey Ford tell how her letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein ended up being disclosed to the public, I think Ms. Ford has been victimized twice. By her account, she was a victim of adolescent hormones in that upstairs bedroom 36 years ago but remained silent for years. With her July letter she broke her silence but proceeded cautiously, wishing to remain anonymous.It appears someone on Sen. Feinstein's staff outed Dr. Ford. She was again victimized, only this time it was political hormones that couldn't restrain themselves. Whether in that bedroom long ago or in Washington's halls of power, her private pleas were callously ignored and a sexually abused woman was exploited again.Ken RicciLarchmont, N.Y.---As U.S. citizens, taxpayers and voters who respect the civilizing rule of law, we should all thank Sen. Jeff Flake for his abiding honor, decency and courage, against enormous pressure few will ever know or imagine, to call for an FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh.Mike ScottLafayette, Calif.---If allegations of sexual abuse, dishonesty and more were brought up in any corporate hiring process, a board or CEO would be severely remiss not to seriously investigate them, if not to outright dismiss the candidate and move on to others. And if the candidate reacted with petulance, outrage, bluster and evasion during the interview, even if innocent, his (or her) fitness for such an important and stressful position would be even further questionable. Any board I have served on would reject such a candidate -- especially as there would likely be others far better suited for the job.Steve HeiligSan Francisco---I have been both sexually assaulted and wrongly accused. I'm hard pressed to say which was worse.Kate JohnsHurricane, Utah---The U.S. Senate has turned into the Jerry Springer show.Susan CharnasLakewood Ranch, Fla.---Since 1989 numerous inmates have been exonerated of murder or sexual assault charges, primarily by the discovery of objective DNA evidence (362 according to the Innocence Project). Many of the sexual-assault convictions involved victims who had sworn in court that there was absolutely no doubt in their minds that the accused had sexually assaulted them. The victims were 100% sure that the accused was the assailant.The falsely accused, completely innocent inmates had spent years or even decades in prison.Ivars LacisPeachtree City, Ga.---I really think that President Trump should nominate Hillary Clinton to the Supreme Court so an investigation of her can finally get started.Michael AdlerMiromar Lakes, Fla."
wsj,U.S. News: Lawyer Wouldn't Prosecute Kavanaugh,"WASHINGTON -- The sex-crimes prosecutor hired by the Senate Judiciary Committee to question Christine Blasey Ford about her allegations of assault against Brett Kavanaugh told the panel she wouldn't have prosecuted the case, according to documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal.Rachel Mitchell, an Arizona prosecutor for more than two decades whom Republicans hired for last Thursday's hearing with Dr. Ford and the Supreme Court nominee, told senators on the panel in a memo Sunday that a reasonable prosecutor wouldn't proceed because of a lack of sufficient evidence.In her memo, Ms. Mitchell acknowledged that ""there is no clear standard of proof for allegations made during the Senate's confirmation process,"" but said that because she is a prosecutor, she was providing her legal assessment on whether the allegations could be prosecuted in court.At the hearing, Ms. Mitchell questioned Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford, a California college professor who has accused the judge of attempting to rape her when they were both teenagers.Judge Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.Ms. Mitchell asked Dr. Ford about the location of the alleged assault and what she remembered. She also asked Judge Kavanaugh about his sexual behavior, though Republican senators largely questioned the high-court nominee on their own.""A 'he said, she said' case is incredibly difficult to prove. But this case is even weaker than that,"" Ms. Mitchell wrote in her memo to the committee. She outlined reasons why, noting that Dr. Ford had given an inconsistent date for when the alleged assault had happened and didn't remember key details, such as how she got home after the alleged attack.In her testimony on Thursday, a steady but emotional Dr. Ford told lawmakers she had been ""haunted by memories"" since the alleged attack at a house party. She said she was ""100%"" certain it was Judge Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge who pushed her into a room, and said her memory of ""the laughter, the uproarious laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense"" was ""indelible.""An attorney for Dr. Ford declined to comment on the memo."
wsj,Kavanaugh May Be the Democrats' Waterloo,"The nine long faces that stare back in photographs of the U.S. Supreme Court radiate a sobriety intended to convince us that it is a bastion of deliberation, reason and uprightness, walled off from the messy business of politics. Nothing has done more to turn that perception upside-down than the past two weeks of sound and fury over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.Perhaps the perception itself has been part of the problem. From the beginning, the Supreme Court was much more of a political cockpit than the legend of jurisprudential neutrality suggests. John Marshall, the most significant chief justice in the court's history, was appointed by President John Adams in the dying weeks of Adams's administration specifically to discomfit the incoming president, Thomas Jefferson. Marshall did so by asserting the court's power to review federal legislation and giving Jefferson's nemesis, Aaron Burr, a free pass at his treason trial in 1807.The courts were notoriously politicized in the fight over slavery. The Judiciary Acts of 1789 and 1837 both required that as new states were admitted to the Union, new federal judicial districts be created for them. If those new states were slave states, pro-slavery jurists from them became candidates for the Supreme Court. By the 1850s, the Supreme Court was composed of ""five slaveholders and two or three doughfaces,"" in the words of Horace Greeley.Not much has changed in the last half-century of culture wars. The 1969 nominations of Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell both foundered on civil-rights politics. Robert Bork went aground on both civil rights and Roe v. Wade -- which was itself the product of considerable political jockeying among the justices on the court at that time. Anyone who imagines that the Supreme Court floats serenely above the political fray knows little of its history. The Kavanaugh fight was just another turn of the screw.When President Trump nominated Judge Kavanaugh in July to fill Justice Anthony Kennedy's seat, the consensus among the wise heads was that the president had played it safe. Judge Kavanaugh was a carefully vetted Kennedy protege with a sterling reputation and a long history of inside-the-Beltway service. The liberal Yale Law School professor Akhil Amar wrote that the nomination was Mr. Trump's ""classiest move"" yet.What turned Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation process into the biggest judicial firestorm in decades had little to do with Judge Kavanaugh and a lot to do with Democrats's overconfidence that his nomination could be turned into a Republican Waterloo. Driven by the conviction that they were riding a big blue wave to the November shore, Democrats laid into Judge Kavanaugh in the hope that something about the nominee could be confected into a seismic rumble and turn the wave into a tsunami.They did not find much. Although Judge Kavanaugh generated baskets upon baskets of documents during his years in the Bush White House, they contained little that set political pulses fluttering. Ditto for his decisions on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which were routinely very conservative but largely concerned out-of-the-spotlight issues such as environmental regulation and due process. Of the 14 Kavanaugh opinions later reviewed by the Supreme Court, 13 were upheld.It was not until a sensational sexual-assault allegation lodged by Christine Blasey Ford was made public in mid-September that the Kavanaugh confirmation appeared to be in any danger, and even then, the charge had the uncomfortable appearance of a Democratic Hail Mary play. The case did not grow stronger over the 10 days that followed Ms. Ford's first public statement. Purported participants or witnesses denied recollection of any assault or of even being present at the party Ms. Ford described.In their testimonies last week, both Judge Kavanaugh and Ms. Ford had some pinholes pricked through their testimonies: he about his wild student life at Georgetown Prep and Yale, she about factual inconsistencies and potential political motivations. But by the end Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the Judiciary Committee Democrats were left without a meaningful case. Judge Kavanaugh might have gone on to a swift confirmation vote had it not been for the last-minute insistence of Sen. Jeff Flake on an additional FBI investigation into the Ford allegations.I have undergone an FBI investigation. In my case, it was for a relatively harmless executive appointment. While it might sound like a forbidding exercise in mystery noir, the reality was nearly as humdrum as a mail delivery. Calls for an investigation arose less from a genuine effort to uncover the truth about a 1982 teen drinking party than from a desire simply to delay the vote. But with the submission of the FBI report, nods of approval from Sens. Flake and Joe Manchin, and Sen. Susan Collins's powerful speech Friday announcing her support for Judge Kavanaugh, the last obstacles to confirmation evaporated. The Democrats spent a lot of credibility over seven days, but they didn't get anything in return except the opportunity to grandstand.If Sen. Feinstein was convinced that Ms. Ford's allegations were serious, she should have shared them with the Judiciary Committee or law enforcement when they first came to her attention weeks earlier. That hesitation -- and then the demand for a delay to conduct an FBI investigation -- have combined to make Mrs. Feinstein look uncertain and perhaps unscrupulous. Judge Kavanaugh's critics did not make themselves look better by turning on the FBI itself when it did not find what they wanted, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal making the McCarthyesque claim that it ""smacks of a coverup."" Ms. Feinstein herself said ""the most notable part of this report is what's not in it,"" suggesting (again) that she has access to some secret knowledge about the case that she won't share.Democrats have also cited Judge Kavanaugh's angry testimony denying sexual assault as itself disqualifying -- as if he had no business crying out while being stretched on the rack. He might not have been as deferential to the senators as norms of judicial gravitas would dictate, but he was certainly more poised than his inquisitors. In the end, even that line of attack accomplished nothing.This process has inflicted real damage to Judge Kavanaugh and Ms. Ford -- enough to make any intelligent citizen wonder if it would ever be worth entering public service. But the most immediate casualty is likely to be the much-hyped November blue wave. If a vote for a Democratic majority in the Senate is a vote for the tactics of Sen. Feinstein, or for the boorish behavior of Sens. Blumenthal, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, then that vote may not materialize at all.In the Missouri Senate race, Republican Josh Hawley has overtaken incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill, largely in reaction to the Kavanaugh hearings. In North Dakota, Republican Kevin Cramer has opened up a yawning lead over Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. The newest Quinnipiac and NPR/PBS NewsHour polls show that the Democratic generic-ballot advantage has halved and the party's enthusiasm advantage has vanished.Napoleon counted on offensive bluster at Waterloo to give him victory, and it failed. By amplifying the politicization of the judiciary, Democrats may have achieved a Waterloo -- but not the one they imagined."
wsj,Kavanaugh's Foes Politicize the FBI,"The bipartisan bonhomie occasioned by the reopening of Judge Brett Kavanaugh's background investigation dissipated quickly. By the weekend, Senate Democrats -- who had demanded the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation -- were challenging its credibility, objecting to its scope and focus, and lamenting that the White House had any involvement in shaping the process.The reopened investigation, according to Sen. Lindsey Graham -- reflecting the White House's view -- potentially entailed interviewing Deborah Ramirez, who claims that Judge Kavanaugh committed lewd conduct while a freshmen at Yale, and the three purported witnesses named by first accuser Christine Blasey Ford -- Mark Judge, P.J. Smyth and Leland Keyser -- all of whom have attested they have no memory that would corroborate her accusation. Julie Swetnick's sordid and implausible claims were to be left out, and if any new allegations against Judge Kavanaugh were to emerge, these also wouldn't be investigated.President Trump told reporters Monday: ""The FBI should interview anybody that they want within reason, but you have to say within reason."" That qualification is crucial. It is clear that Judge Kavanaugh's opponents are clamoring for an open-ended fishing expedition that, probably by design, would go on much longer than a week. They are insisting that the FBI investigate Judge Kavanaugh's drinking while in high school and college and interview anyone who might know about it. Two such people have already come forward, and there are no disincentives for new claimants, possibly driven by partisan or personal animus, to emerge.Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) tried to justify his demand to broaden the FBI investigation by claiming that heavy drinking was ""directly relevant"" to the sexual-assault allegations. If this approach were adopted, the FBI would have to interview a very large pool of witnesses about Judge Kavanaugh's alcohol intake, and possibly many other personal traits, over many years. Never mind that alcohol use is a standard FBI question, certainly asked in the course of Judge Kavanaugh's previous six background investigations.Kavanaugh foes also want the FBI to interview people who might challenge the credibility of pro-Kavanaugh witnesses. Mr. Judge is a prominent target here. His former girlfriend Elizabeth Rasor has stated publicly that he has disclosed to her facts relating to his past sexual activities that have nothing to do with Judge Kavanaugh, but cast Mr. Judge in a negative light. This approach could also open up a never-ending investigation, in which the FBI inquires into the credibility of all witnesses, whether pro- or anti-Kavanaugh, including witnesses interviewed to test other witnesses' credibility.The demands get even more absurd. ""For its investigation to be comprehensive, the FBI must also get to the bottom of what 'boofing' means,"" wrote Brian Fallon, who worked as press secretary for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, in Politico on Monday. That's a reference to a joke in Mr. Kavanaugh's high-school yearbook entry. As Mr. Fallon notes, ""Kavanaugh said it referred to 'flatulence.'""The entire debate is complicated by confusion about what the FBI does in a background investigation. Even former Director James Comey is mixed up. He penned a vastly misleading New York Times op-ed Sunday, in which he seemed to conflate background checks with criminal probes. ""It is one thing to have your lawyer submit a statement on your behalf,"" Mr. Comey wrote. ""It is a very different thing to sit across from two F.B.I. special agents and answer their relentless questions.""The FBI is primarily a law-enforcement agency. Its criminal investigations are often wide-ranging, can be potentially expanded into new areas, and have no preset time limits. Although the president has authority under the Constitution to direct the exercise of all federal law-enforcement activities, in practice the FBI enjoys great autonomy when conducting criminal investigations. Agents seek both to uncover the facts and to assess the credibility of everybody they interview. Their questioning is often aggressive and repetitive. Interviewees are warned they will face criminal penalties if they lie to the FBI.FBI background investigations are a fundamentally different affair. They are not based on any explicit statutory authorization but are founded on regulations authorizing investigations of persons who seek federal government employment. The bureau's authority to conduct investigations of nominees dates to at least President Eisenhower's Executive Order 10450 of 1953, though some scholars credit the beginning of the process to President Hoover and his request of Attorney General William Mitchell to investigate the qualification of applicants for judicial positions.FBI background investigations are carried out by a special team within the bureau called Special Inquiry and General Background Investigations Unit. SIGBIU functions as a gatherer of facts. It doesn't cajole or challenge witnesses and routinely offers them anonymity. It never proffers any credibility assessments or speculates about the motives of witnesses.SIGBIU operates on tight deadlines and usually moves faster with Supreme Court nominations. The process begins and is completed well before the nominee's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing takes place. Occasionally, SIGBIU is directed to conduct further interviews. Throughout the whole process, it operates under instructions from both the Justice Department and the White House Counsel's Office.Significantly, there is a firewall between SIGBIU and FBI's criminal-investigative divisions. SIGBIU's goal is to have witnesses be open and forthcoming. Agents routinely assure witnesses that nothing that they say during the interview will be referred for criminal investigation. Even more fundamental, the FBI's velvet-glove approach to background investigations reflects its recognition that people they interview are not suspected of any crimes and cannot be coerced into cooperating or threatened with a grand jury subpoena.Running a background investigation as if it were a criminal one would destroy the FBI's ability to conduct the former. It would cause many Americans to refuse to cooperate. It would cause the bureau to exceed its constitutionally proper remit. And having the FBI proffer credibility determinations in the context of a judicial appointment would politicize the bureau -- and, as then-Sen. Joe Biden correctly asserted during Justice Clarence Thomas's 1991 confirmation hearings, it would usurp a function that properly belongs to the president and the Senate.The demands by anti-Kavanaugh Democrats are blatantly partisan and unfair. What they seek has never been done with any judicial nominee in American history. They also run afoul of important legal and practical realities of FBI-conducted background investigations. If countenanced, they would politicize the FBI and destroy the judicial confirmation process."
wsj,Kavanaugh and the Senate's Honor,"Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has scheduled a Senate vote for Friday morning to close debate and move Brett Kavanaugh toward a final confirmation vote on Saturday, and it's about time. The undecided Senators have had their extra week for an FBI probe, the review has turned up nothing to support the assault accusations against him, and now Senators should vote to put a worthy judge on the Supreme Court.Democrats are complaining that the FBI report is incomplete, but then no report would satisfy them unless it found evidence that apparently doesn't exist. ""The most notable part of this report is what's not in it,"" said Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She thinks accusations that have no corroboration are credible because the FBI can't prove that something didn't happen.---The FBI was always likely to turn up little new evidence because Christine Blasey Ford recalls so little about the assault she says took place 36 years ago. The witnesses she says were there, including her best friend, say they don't recall the party or refute that it happened. There are no corroborating witnesses and no incriminating evidence, and Ms. Ford's story about key details also keeps changing.The best summary of her case is in the memo by Rachel Mitchell, the Arizona prosecutor who specializes in sexual-assault cases and was invited to question Ms. Ford by Judiciary Republicans. ""A 'he said, she-said' case is incredibly difficult to prove. But this case is even weaker than that,"" Ms. Mitchell wrote. ""I do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the Committee. Nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.""You don't have to believe Ms. Ford is lying to vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, and we don't doubt her sincerity. You can simply assume that memories can be wrong after so many decades, and that it would be a terrible precedent to disqualify such a distinguished nominee when he categorically denies it and there is no corroborating evidence.The latest liberal attack is that Judge Kavanaugh's passionate defense of his integrity and his criticism of Democrats at his second hearing shows he lacks proper ""judicial temperament."" Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski is said to be vexed by this point, though she didn't raise it when she asked for an additional week for the FBI to investigate.Mr. Kavanaugh has exhibited impeccable temperament in his 12 years on the federal bench, while teaching at Harvard, and in the rest of his public life. Only after Democrats accused him of vile behavior, and the media amplified it as if it were fact, did the judge react with the indignation that any normal innocent person would.By this temperament standard, Democrats are entitled to accuse him of abusing women, being a drunk and committing crimes, and he is supposed to take it with a smile and a thank you for the question, good sir. Had he meekly pleaded for mercy at the Democratic Judiciary court, opponents would have said he looked guilty.Then there is the claim that Mr. Kavanaugh has been treated no worse than Judge Merrick Garland, the Barack Obama nominee who was denied a Senate hearing and confirmation vote in 2016. So destroying a man's reputation and accusing him of gang rape is the same as putting a nomination on hold for several months to let the voters decide who should nominate the next Supreme Court Justice?The idea of delaying a confirmation vote in a presidential election year was set by none other than current Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. ""We should not confirm any Bush nominee to the Supreme Court, except in extraordinary circumstances,"" Mr. Schumer said in a July 2007 speech to the American Constitution Society. Democrats then held the Senate, and Mr. Schumer was putting down a marker if someone on the High Court were to retire in George W. Bush's final year as President.---Judge Kavanaugh is by all accounts one of the most qualified nominees for the Supreme Court in recent history. He has more appellate-court experience than Antonin Scalia did in 1986, and he has had more of his judicial reasoning adopted by the Supreme Court. Nothing in his three decades of public life echoes the behavior that his accusers claim they saw in his high school and college days. On the merits, confirmation is an easy vote.Yet the stakes are larger because of the smears and character assassination. To reject Judge Kavanaugh now would ratify these Democratic tactics, with damaging consequences for the Senate, the Supreme Court and American politics. If uncorroborated accusations from decades ago can destroy a distinguished career for political reasons, then the same can happen to anyone and will happen to many.Democrats have done great damage to the Senate that will take years to undo, but the first crucial step is confirming Brett Kavanaugh."
wsj,U.S. News: Kavanaugh Case Is Test for Accuser's Lawyer,"Debra Katz has long been a Washington fixture on sexual harassment cases and the #MeToo movement. But never has she faced anything like the scrutiny accompanying the Brett Kavanaugh case, with its far-reaching political, social, and legal stakes.If Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed, he could bring a rightward shift to the Supreme Court for decades, and the battle is playing out amid a divided country. The impact of Thursday's pivotal hearing could depend in no small part on Ms. Katz's skill in navigating these cross-currents.Ms. Katz, a 59-year-old attorney representing Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford, has worked on women's rights for more than three decades. As more women have come forward with allegations of harassment, assault and retaliation in recent years, she has built a high-profile portfolio.She represented an aide alleging harassment by former Rep. Pat Meehan (R., Pa.), who resigned in April, and has guided other Capitol Hill women. She represented women alleging harassment by a former NPR news executive, and students alleging a hostile environment at the University of Mary Washington. She sued celebrity chef Mike Isabella on behalf of an employee alleging a sexually abusive work environment, a case that settled in May.With the Kavanaugh controversy, Ms. Katz has become a polarizing figure. Conservatives suggest she is motivated by partisanship, citing donations to Democratic candidates and support for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Her supporters counter that she has pursued men of different political stripes, for example handling allegations against Democrat Eric Schneiderman, New York's former attorney general.""I've handled a number of high-profile matters, and I've handled a number of matters that no one has ever read about,"" Ms. Katz said in an interview. ""This is obviously in the public domain on a level that I have not had experience with before. This has definitely been a very intense period.""Dr. Ford alleges that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a party when the two were teenagers, a claim he categorically denies.While Ms. Katz is playing a big role in the #MeToo movement, some Kavanaugh supporters say the allegation, involving one purported incident from his teenage years, should not be seen as part of that movement.""Let's not compare what's one allegation from 36 years ago against Judge Kavanaugh-- that he has completely denied-- to what has happened as a matter of pattern and practice that went on for years, if not decades, in some of the most powerful C-suites in our country,"" Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to President Trump, said on CNN.Despite the high stakes, the Kavanaugh case is an extension of Ms. Katz's career rather than a break from it. Her work on sexual harassment dates to 1985, when she held a women's rights fellowship at Georgetown University. There she worked on a landmark case that went to the Supreme Court, Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, which established that workplace sexual harassment constituted sex discrimination in violation of federal law.She started a two-person law firm in 1987 specializing in employment discrimination and whistleblowing."
wsj,A Kavanaugh Hearing Without Facts Would Be a Sham,"It's as if Democrats found the Christine Blasey Ford allegations too good to risk finding out if they were true. That's the real problem.A thinking person realizes that even if the charges themselves remain unprovable, there are plenty of unknown but potentially knowable facts about the alleged events in question -- facts that could have been found out.She doesn't remember at whose house the party was held, is uncertain of the year or what the occasion was, but she can name four other people who were present. Not much digging in these people's circle of acquaintance by a competent and motivated Democratic investigator might well have yielded answers that could have led to more witnesses and more answers.Unclear in her accounts is how well she knew Brett Kavanaugh before the alleged incident, or on what basis she now identifies the Supreme Court nominee as the 17-year-old who attacked her when she was 15. This information could have been nailed down as well by a discreet investigator without necessarily even describing Ms. Ford's complaint, which she had wished to keep confidential.At least some of the facts, if they exist, were ripe to be fleshed out weeks ago if Democrats had bothered to make a conscientious determination: Either pursue the matter or drop it. Instead Sen. Dianne Feinstein did both. She sat on the allegations for weeks, perhaps judging them unprovable. Then she changed course when she apparently feared her own re-election might be endangered if fellow liberals found out she had been sitting on them.Republicans, who recognize the horrible precedent of a nominee (of any party) being blockable by a single, last-minute, ancient, unprovable allegation, will also realize that confirming Judge Kavanaugh doesn't end it. The knowable facts will be pursued and come out eventually.One thing we can be grateful for: A public hearing seems unlikely, which could only have been a clown show, a ""he said, she said"" circus of no dispositive value in the absence of senators' first getting to the bottom of the knowable facts.We pause here to make a point that can't be made often enough. Americans who are horrified by the election of Donald Trump have not reckoned with the fact that, by the well-informed lights of millions of their fellow citizens, our existing leaders have been nothing to write home about. The idea that Mr. Trump is some great derogation from the normally high quality of officeholders is much exaggerated.To hold hearings without nailing down the knowable facts would be purposeless except to show respect for Ms. Ford's accusations. Judge Kavanaugh would likely be peppered with absurd questions meant to suggest a connection between a propensity to rape and skepticism about Roe v. Wade. From Republicans, who would fear being accused of badgering a victim, there would have been no searching questions about Ms. Ford's motives, the relationship troubles that 30 years after the fact she evidently blamed on Mr. Kavanaugh, or the clarity of her memories.If you take Ms. Ford at her word, her story still leaves room for doubt about whether the episode was, as she characterizes it, attempted rape. Her interpretation of the incident, by her own reported account, changed in hindsight. Plus the idea that memory is a reliable stenographer of events is so thoroughly discredited that it's no wonder we constantly have to be reminded of the fact.On the flip side, a rite of passage of the American teenager is discovering what sort of person he or she becomes under the influence of alcohol. In many cases it is not a happy discovery. Mr. Kavanaugh has conducted himself ever since in a manner that suggests that, even if the alleged acts occurred in some fashion, they are unrepresentative.Let us hope, when this episode is over, the reputational damage falls where it should: less on the two protagonists than on senators who have so completely botched their own job. Take Sen. Mazie Hirono, who declaimed far and wide: ""Not only do women like Dr. Ford, who bravely comes forward, need to be heard, but they need to be believed. . . . I believe her.""This is not the attitude of a responsible adult, let alone one whose job is making the factual determinations on which national policy is based. Your wishes don't make facts. A claim is not true because it comes from the mouth of a woman or false because it comes from the mouth of a man (or vice versa).That such a person is in a position of power, of course, is less worrisome in a democracy than in any other system. In a democracy, the frequent imbecility of decision-making is a vice we willingly live with because of democracy's great virtue: its many and constant feedback loops that allow idiotic policies to be reversed or ameliorated.America has been demonstrating this proposition for 242 years. It's a chief selling point of the U.S. model. This is also why we might be wise to worry a bit less about Donald Trump (who is democracy personified in this sense) and a bit more about some of the antidemocratic means used to oppose him."
wsj,Kavanaugh Heads for Confirmation --- Support from Senator Collins clears path for nominee ahead of Saturday floor vote,"WASHINGTON -- Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court was all but secured on Friday when Sen. Susan Collins declared her support on the Senate floor, capping a tumultuous 13-week battle that was stirred in recent weeks by allegations of sexual misconduct and raw emotion in both parties.The day unfolded with slow suspense, after Judge Kavanaugh cleared a key procedural hurdle in a 51-49 vote, but the handful of undecided senators announced their final stances one at a time over the course of the afternoon. By late afternoon, it was clear that Judge Kavanaugh would win the simple majority needed for confirmation. That sets up a final vote in the Senate on Saturday on a nomination that would cement a 5-4 conservative majority on the Supreme Court.Judge Kavanaugh could join the court as early as Tuesday, when the high court is to hear two cases involving sentencing rules under the Armed Career Criminal Act.Friday's vote marked the winding down of a brutally partisan fight in the Senate with only a month before midterm elections. The already intense battle over whether President Trump would be able to tip the court further to the right was fueled by the explosive allegations of sexual misconduct in recent weeks, and a disagreement over the extent of a further Federal Bureau of Investigation probe that was pushed by wavering GOP senators late last week.Ms. Collins, of Maine, the last undecided Republican senator, delivered the 50th vote for the judge. Later, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said that he, too, would vote in favor of the nominee, the sole Democrat to do so.""I struggled with it for a long time,"" Ms. Collins said, adding she reached the decision on Thursday evening after pondering the recent testimony of California professor Christine Blasey Ford.""I was very disturbed by the allegations that were put forth and I found Christine Ford's testimony to be very heart-wrenching, painful and compelling. But there was a lack of corroborating evidence no matter where you looked.""In the end, a single Republican -- Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- announced her opposition to Judge Kavanaugh, though she said she would vote ""present"" on Saturday to account for an absent GOP senator. That highlighted the shift of the Supreme Court confirmation process from one that was relatively bipartisan a few decades ago to a sharply polarized undertaking today.Friday's procedural vote came after the FBI probe into decades-old allegations of sexual misconduct by the future judge ended Thursday without new concerns being raised by the handful of undecided senators. The nominee has denied the allegations.Republicans appeared more confident of the nomination after reading the report, saying there was no corroboration of the allegations. Democrats argued the probe was too limited in scope. During the turbulent confirmation process, Democrats cited Judge Kavanaugh's emails as a White House aide, past court decisions and actions from high school in declaring him unfit. Republicans asked if anyone would ever expose themselves to such withering -- and, they said, deeply unfair -- scrutiny again.One year after the #MeToo movement began costing high-profile men in Congress, media and Wall Street their jobs, women dressed in black filled the halls of Senate office buildings, angry that a man accused of sexual assault would be confirmed to the high court. But Judge Kavanaugh's words resonated with many who feared that the nominee was being targeted by accusations for which there was too little corroboration.""Every person -- man or woman -- who makes a charge of sexual assault deserves to be heard and treated with respect,"" Ms. Collins said on the Senate floor Friday as Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation crossed the 50-vote threshold. ""The #MeToo movement is real. It matters. It is needed. And it is long overdue.""Mr. Manchin said he made the decision to support the nominee on Friday morning, after again reviewing the FBI report in a secured area.""I believe Dr. Ford, something happened to Dr. Ford,"" Mr. Manchin said. ""I don't believe the facts that show that it was Brett Kavanaugh.""The vote marked a victory both for Mr. Trump -- who cites his first Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch, as an accomplishment -- as well for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who has made shaping the judiciary a central part of his agenda.The FBI report into the sexual assault allegations moved several wavering Republicans to support Judge Kavanaugh. Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said Friday he would support the nominee, after having been previously undecided.Ms. Murkowski, however, told reporters that she didn't believe confirming Judge Kavanaugh would shore up public faith in the high court.""This hasn't been fair to the judge, but I also recognize we need to have institutions that are viewed as fair,"" she said.As the nomination entered its final stretch, Democrats said FBI agents had failed to conduct a legitimate investigation and hadn't interviewed all relevant witnesses. The bureau questioned nine witnesses and contacted a 10th to produce its 46-page report.The FBI didn't interview Dr. Ford, who accused Judge Kavanaugh of having assaulted her at a party when they were teenagers, Democrats noted"
wsj,Deal Sets Up Hearing on Kavanaugh --- Some details still under discussion as parties wrangle ahead of Thursday showdown,"The stage was set for a dramatic public hearing Thursday over sexual-assault allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, with Democrats planning to delve broadly into the Supreme Court nominee's past and Republicans aiming to keep a narrow focus on the substance of the accusations.Lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford, Judge Kavanaugh's accuser, said Sunday that she would appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee at 10 a.m. Thursday and answer questions about her allegation that Judge Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her and tried to remove her clothing when they were teenagers. Judge Kavanaugh has denied the allegation.Details of the hearing were still being hammered out late Sunday, after days of wrangling and partisan positioning. The hearing would play a big role in determining whether Judge Kavanaugh, who many think would likely tilt the high court further to the right, is confirmed by the Republican-majority Senate.On Sunday evening, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee's top Democrat, asked for an immediate postponement of the hearing after new allegations surfaced in an article in the New Yorker.Deborah Ramirez, a college classmate of Judge Kavanaugh, told the magazine that she remembered that Judge Kavanaugh had exposed himself to her at a drunken party when they were at Yale University. Judge Kavanaugh said in a statement Sunday that the alleged incident didn't happen, and the White House said it stood by the nominee.Judge Kavanaugh said, ""This is a smear, plain and simple.""The Wall Street Journal couldn't verify the allegations. Ms. Ramirez and her lawyer didnt return requests seeking comment.Looking ahead to the hearing, Democrats said that they plan to press Judge Kavanaugh, 53 years old, on his teenage drinking habits. Dr. Ford, now a 51-year-old college professor in California, has said she believes he was drunk when the incident she alleges occurred at a party when she was 15 and he was 17.""It's certainly relevant to the whole conversation. Dr. Ford has said that they were stumbling at the time that this occurred,"" Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, said on ABC. ""There have been a lot of things said about the alcohol that was consumed by the judge as well as by others in his school. That has to be part of any relevant questioning.""Some Republicans, meanwhile, said Judge Kavanaugh's nomination shouldn't be derailed without sufficient evidence. ""Unless there's something more, no, I'm not going to ruin Judge Kavanaugh's life over this,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said on Fox Sunday morning.The White House has developed a two-track approach for the hearing, a person close to the confirmation process said. Officials argue questions about Judge Kavanaugh's high-school drinking should be off-limits. If Democrats make such inquiries, similar questions should be asked of Dr. Ford, this person said.It isn't clear how much sway the White House can exert over the senators, but Judge Kavanaugh could decline to answer questions he considers out of bounds, the person said. In practice sessions, he has been prepping to do just that, said a Republican who has discussed the matter with White House officials.Over the weekend, Republicans stressed that in addition to Judge Kavanaugh, three people publicly identified as being at the party where the assault allegedly occurred said they don't recall it.A lawyer for Patrick Smyth, whose name surfaced in connection with the party last week, emailed the Judiciary Committee that he had ""no knowledge"" of the party and had ""never witnessed any improper conduct by Brett Kavanaugh towards women.""In addition, Judiciary Committee aides sent a letter to Leland Keyser on Tuesday, after the Washington Post reported that Dr. Ford said Ms. Keyser attended the party.In a letter to the committee, Ms. Keyser's attorney, Howard Walsh, said, ""Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford."" Ms. Keyser told the Post, however, that she believed Dr. Ford's allegations.Debra Katz, a lawyer for Dr. Ford, said the lack of recollection isn't surprising. ""As Dr. Ford has said, she did not share her story publicly or with anyone for years following the incident with Judge Kavanaugh,"" she said in a statement. ""It's not surprising that Ms. Keyser has no recollection of the evening as they did not discuss it.""Judge Kavanaugh also plans to turn over calendar records from his teenage years that don't include an entry for the sort of party that Dr. Ford described, a person familiar with the process said.Among several points of contention late Sunday, Republicans said they would insist on a key point: that outside lawyers, in addition to senators, be allowed to question Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. Dr. Ford has objected to fending off questions from anyone other than lawmakers.Republican lawmakers and White House officials have privately said they are worried about the optics of the 11 male GOP senators on the Judiciary Committee questioning a woman who is alleging she was sexually assaulted. Sen. Graham said on Fox that a designated lawyer would ferret out more information.""We've got 11 politicians who haven't done a trial in about 20 years,"" said Sen. Graham, adding, ""I thought it would be really smart to have somebody come in who knows what the hell they're doing, to ask the questions, to be respectful.""Four of the 10 Democratic Judiciary members are women, and they argue Republicans are seeking to hide the lack of Republican women on the committee. Democrats are also continuing to press for other witnesses at the hearing, including Mark Judge, who Dr. Ford has said was present during the alleged assault. A lawyer for Mr. Judge said in a letter to the Judiciary Committee last week that he has no memory of the alleged incident and doesn't want to testify.Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), the committee's chairman, suggested he wouldn't yield on these points. ""The Committee determines which witnesses to call, how many witnesses to call, in what order to call them, and who will question them,"" Mr. Grassley's aides said in a statement.---Terms & ConditionsLawyers and congressional aides have spent days haggling over the terms of Thursday's hearing featuring Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s. The judge has denied the allegations.Republicans have agreed to some of Dr. Ford's requests; others remain in dispute. Here's a further look:What has been settled:-- The hearing will begin at 10 a.m. Thursday. There will be a break every 45 minutes, with additional breaks as requested.-- Dr. Ford will have a dedicated security team and will have two lawyers at the table with her while testifying.-- Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh won't be in the hearing room at the same time.-- Dr. Ford will testify first, giving Judge Kavanaugh a chance to defend himself against the specifics of her allegations.-- Democratic lawmakers will question Judge Kavanaugh themselves.-- Senators from each side will be given the same number of rounds of questions, with an equal number of minutes per round.-- Limited access for TV cameras and other media.What remains unresolved:-- Who will question Dr. Ford on the GOP side? Republicans want to use female staff attorneys or outside counsel to question Dr. Ford before senators do, but her lawyers are resisting that.-- How long will senators ask questions? That's still being determined.-- Who will testify? Republicans say only Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh should appear. Democrats want additional witnesses including Mark Judge, whom Dr. Ford says was in the room during the assault; a former FBI agent who gave her a polygraph test; and trauma experts.-- Kristina Peterson"
wsj,FBI Report Fuels GOP Confidence --- Two key lawmakers signal approval of a reopened investigation into Judge Kavanaugh,"WASHINGTON -- Republican leaders said they were increasingly confident Thursday that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh would win confirmation after a reopened FBI investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct ended without new concerns being raised by the handful of undecided senators.Judge Kavanaugh faces a critical procedural vote Friday morning, which is expected to forecast the tally of the final confirmation vote on Saturday. Democrats, infuriated by the limits of the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into allegations leveled against him, have grown gloomier at the prospect of losing the wrenching national fight over a seat that would tip the balance of the high court to the right.After weeks in limbo, Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation picked up momentum Thursday after Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine, two of the three undecided GOP senators, said they found the FBI investigation to be thorough.Asked whether he now had enough information to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, Mr. Flake -- who last week was prepared to vote for the nominee -- suggested the report contained no new evidence supporting the sexual-misconduct allegations.""I'm still reviewing the information, but we've seen no additional information yet -- no additional corroborating information,"" Mr. Flake said. Ms. Collins praised the FBI for completing a ""very thorough investigation,"" though she said she was still reviewing the documents.The third publicly undecided Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, gave no signal of her leanings on Thursday. If all Democrats vote no, Republicans, who hold a 51-49 advantage in the Senate, can afford to lose no more than one of their own troops.Entering the final stretch of the bitter fight over Judge Kavanaugh, Democrats said FBI agents had failed to conduct a legitimate investigation because they hadn't interviewed all relevant witnesses. The bureau questioned nine witnesses and contacted a tenth to produce the 46-page report that was delivered to the Capitol at 2:30 a.m. Thursday.The FBI didn't interview Christine Blasey Ford, the California college psychology professor who accused Judge Kavanaugh of assaulting her at a party when they were teenagers, Democrats noted.The FBI did speak with Deborah Ramirez, who told the New Yorker an inebriated Judge Kavanaugh exposed himself to her when they were in college. Her lawyer, however, said she named more than 20 individuals ""likely to have relevant information,"" and the FBI contacted few if any of them.Judge Kavanaugh has denied the allegations lodged by Dr. Ford and Ms. Ramirez, saying he has never sexually assaulted anyone and characterizing the accusations as a political smear.Democrats ridiculed what they described as the probe's skimpiness. ""All of our worst fears about this being incomplete in the extreme have been justified,"" said Sen. Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii). ""It's like you lose your keys in your apartment and you only look on the bathroom floor and you decide the keys are gone.""Friday's procedural vote on Judge Kavanaugh was set to divide largely along party lines. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, a Democrat running for re-election in a conservative state, said Thursday she would oppose Judge Kavanaugh, leaving Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia as the only undecided Democrat.Lawmakers from both parties predicted Mr. Manchin, also up for re-election in a state won by Republican President Trump, would end up backing Mr. Kavanaugh. GOP senators and aides were optimistic that Mr. Flake also would vote for Judge Kavanaugh. In the event of a 50-50 tie, Vice President Mike Pence would cast a vote to break the impasse.Although some strategists initially believed Ms. Collins's support for abortion rights made her a possible no vote, she has praised Judge Kavanaugh and said she doesn't believe he would overturn the Roe v. Wade abortion case.Among Republicans, the biggest question mark remained Ms. Murkowski, who was steadfastly noncommittal Thursday. She won an unusual write-in re-election victory eight years ago, leaving her liberated from the GOP hierarchy. Some of the Alaska Natives who helped fuel her victory oppose Judge Kavanaugh because of a case in which he questioned whether constitutional protections for Native American tribes should extend to Native Hawaiians, a view they fear could threaten similar protections enjoyed by Alaskan Natives.All day Thursday, senators streamed in and out of the secure room in the Capitol complex where they could examine a single copy of the FBI report, whose 12 sections were distributed among whichever lawmakers were present. Senators had to sign up for specific time slots to review the FBI's findings, which they were permitted to discuss publicly only in vague terms.The White House renewed its calls to move forward. Senators ""have been given ample time to review this seventh background investigation,"" said White House spokesman Raj Shah, referring to earlier FBI background probes of Judge Kavanaugh.Lawyers for Dr. Ford said they were ""profoundly disappointed"" that the FBI didn't speak to her. ""An FBI supplemental background investigation that did not include an interview of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford -- nor the witnesses who corroborate her testimony -- cannot be called an investigation,"" said Michael Bromwich, an attorney for Dr. Ford.The FBI questioned several people who Dr. Ford said were at the house party when she was allegedly assaulted, including Judge Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge, who was said to be in the room during the alleged assault, and P.J. Smyth, a football teammate, as well as Dr. Ford's friend Leland Keyser.Democrats had listed about two dozen individuals they said should be interviewed to support or disprove the allegations, but the FBI didn't question most of them."
wsj,"GOP, Accuser Dig In On Terms --- Grassley says vote on Kavanaugh would go ahead if talks fail to resolve disagreements","WASHINGTON -- Negotiations between Republicans and lawyers for the woman accusing Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault stretched into late Friday, with both sides trying to shape terms of a hearing next week that would likely determine whether the Supreme Court nominee is confirmed.Late Friday, there were several points of contention: the day of the week; whether Judge Kavanaugh or his accuser, California professor Christine Blasey Ford, would speak first; and whether other people would be brought in to testify and to question the witnesses.In a statement Friday evening, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) told Dr. Ford's attorneys that if they didn't respond later Friday night, the panel would go ahead and vote on the nominee Monday. ""We cannot continue to delay,"" Mr. Grassley said in the statement.Dr. Ford's attorney asked for an additional day to respond, saying her client had been meeting with the Federal Bureau of Investigation about death threats she had been receiving, and needed more time.Meantime, President Trump weighed in more aggressively Friday, challenging Dr. Ford's account against his Supreme Court nominee.As Republican lawmakers conferred on how to respond to the conditions Dr. Ford's attorneys listed for her to testify, it was uncertain whether the disputes would derail the chance that she would agree to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Dr. Ford, 51 years old, alleges that while they were both in high school in the early 1980s, Judge Kavanaugh, 53, groped her and tried to remove her clothes after he and a friend pulled her into a room. Judge Kavanaugh has strongly denied the allegations.Republican lawmakers earlier had offered Wednesday, not Thursday, which Dr. Ford's lawyers requested. They rejected Dr. Ford's request that Judge Kavanaugh speak first in the hearing, saying they wanted the nominee to have a chance to respond to her accusations. And they objected to bringing in other people to testify besides Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford, as Democrats and Dr. Ford's lawyers want.GOP lawmakers also are pushing for outside counsels -- rather than solely the lawmakers on the committee -- to question Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh in any hearing. Dr. Ford's legal team has opposed that idea, saying the senators themselves should ask the questions.Among other things, Democrats believe Republicans are trying to avoid the image of the committee's 11 male GOP senators interrogating a woman who is alleging sexual assault. GOP senators say it makes sense to have legal professionals asking question.Republicans on the Judiciary Committee hope to vote on Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation within days or weeks, with a vote by the full Senate to follow shortly after that. The Supreme Court begins hearing cases on Oct. 1, with the Nov. 6 midterms looming shortly after that. Most political analysts believe Democrats have a chance, albeit a slim one, of retaking control of the Senate, where Republicans hold a 51-49 edge. That would create much more difficult terrain for the Republican Mr. Trump to get a Supreme Court nominee approved.In a tweet Friday, Mr. Trump signaled a tougher strategy against Dr. Ford. ""I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents,"" Mr. Trump tweeted. ""I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place!""Dr. Ford's attorney, Debra Katz, didn't respond to questions about the tweet. Dr. Ford's parents didn't return a call seeking comment.Experts say sexual-assault victims often don't come forward for years, if ever. The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network says about two-thirds of sexual assaults aren't reported to law enforcement.After Dr. Ford came forward with the allegation publicly last Sunday, the president for several days largely confined his comments to praising Judge Kavanaugh, saying Dr. Ford should be heard, and urging that any delay in the confirmation process be brief.Some areas of agreement did emerge Friday. Republicans appear willing to accommodate a request from Dr. Ford's attorneys to ensure the security of their client, who has received threats since coming forward. Dr. Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California, planned to meet with Federal Bureau of Investigation agents Friday in San Francisco about the threats.But the two sides remained apart in other areas. Democrats want to summon to testify Mark Judge, whom Dr. Ford has named as a friend of Judge Kavanaugh's and the only other person in the room during the alleged assault. Republicans oppose hearing from Mr. Judge.Despite the turbulence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) expressed confidence Friday that Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation was on track. ""You watch the fight, you watch the tactics, but here's what I want to tell you: In the very near future, Judge Kavanaugh will be"" on the Supreme Court, he told a conference for social conservatives in WashingtonSen. Maggie Hassan (D., N.H.) took issue with those comments. ""They are saying that even if Dr. Ford comes forward and tells her story . . . they don't care,"" she said on CNN."
wsj,Kavanaugh And Accuser Will Testify --- Senate panel sets a hearing next week on allegation of assault by high-court nominee,"WASHINGTON -- The Senate Judiciary Committee said Monday it would hold a hearing next week with Judge Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who has accused him of sexual assault, setting the stage for a dramatic public showdown that could determine the fate of his nomination to the Supreme Court.The hearing will give citizens and lawmakers a chance to hear more about the three-decades-old accusations against Judge Kavanaugh from his teenage years at a prep school in the Washington, D.C., area. Judge Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the accusation, and the White House has said it would proceed with his nomination.The planned session will ""give these recent allegations a full airing,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), the Judiciary Committee's chairman.Several Republican senators whose votes will be key to confirming Judge Kavanaugh have said the allegations are serious and merit a full public accounting. The hearing, to be held next Monday, will be Judge Kavanaugh's best chance to rescue his imperiled nomination and respond to the allegations in a public forum.The hearing will pit his credibility against an explosive accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford, a California college professor, who said he sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers. Mrs. Ford told the Washington Post that when she and Judge Kavanaugh were teenagers at a party in the Washington, D.C., area, he and a friend pulled her into a bedroom. Judge Kavanaugh pinned her down on the bed, groped her and attempted to remove her clothing before she escaped, Mrs. Ford said in the article.Mrs. Ford, now a professor at Palo Alto University in California, described the episode as aggressive. ""I thought he might inadvertently kill me,"" she told the Post. She said that Mr. Kavanaugh appeared to be intoxicated during their encounter. Efforts to reach Mrs. Ford weren't successful.Judge Kavanaugh called the accusation ""completely false."" He added: ""I have never done anything like what the accuser describes -- to her or to anyone."" He said he didn't know who was making the accusation until Mrs. Ford identified herself on Sunday.Republican leaders spent Monday behind closed doors debating over how to proceed with Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. He was tapped in July to succeed the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. The confirmation of a new, conservative justice to the high court is a top priority of both President Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress.After initial signals that Republican leaders would pursue private phone calls with the judge and his accuser rather than a public forum, Mr. Grassley said late Monday the panel would go ahead with a hearing featuring both Mrs. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. Mr. Grassley said he made the decision after his staff spoke with Mrs. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh in the afternoon.President Trump indicated he was willing to accept a small delay in the confirmation process to sort out the allegations.""We want to go through a full process . . . and hear everybody out,"" said Mr. Trump, while also praising Judge Kavanaugh. ""If it takes a little delay, it'll take a little delay.""Members of Republican Senate leadership expressed cautious optimism that the hearing could put Judge Kavanaugh's nomination back on track. Republicans had been hoping to hold a confirmation vote in committee this week and move him to the Senate floor next week -- in time for him to join the court at the start of its fall session.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he supported the decision to hold a hearing about the accusations.""The committee has made a good decision and we're going to go forward with it,"" he said. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), another member of Senate leadership, said of the hearing: ""I just think that's the only way that both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanuagh have the opportunity to make their case.""The path to Judge Kavanuagh's confirmation hinges on his performance in the hearing. The Republicans control the Senate by a narrow 51-49 advantage, so two Republican votes against Judge Kavanaugh would be enough to sink his nomination if Democrats were to vote against him as a bloc.Several Republicans have said that they are withholding judgment until the hearing, including key votes like Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona. ""I need to see them and listen to their answers to the questions in order to make an assessment,"" Ms. Collins said.Other Republicans stood by Judge Kavanaugh. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said he had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh and that the nominee denied being at the party in question. ""I believe him,"" Mr. Hatch said. ""He's a person of immense integrity.""The planned hearing is reminiscent of the 1991 confirmation hearing of now-Justice Clarence Thomas that featured testimony by Anita Hill, a college professor, that Justice Thomas had sexually harassed her when he had been her supervisor. Justice Thomas denied the allegation.This time, a hearing would unfold against the additional backdrop of a growing movement against sexual harassment and the fractious politics of the Trump presidency and the midterm election season.Judge Kavanaugh visited the White House Monday and spoke by phone to senators, fielding questions about the sexual-assault allegations, a White House official said.Mrs. Ford first contacted Congress with her allegations in July, hoping to remain anonymous. The matter spilled into public view several days ago when Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said she had reported a matter involving Judge Kavanaugh to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mrs. Feinstein didn't initially name Mrs. Ford, saying the individual had requested confidentiality.Democrats have been seeking to slow down the Kavanaugh confirmation process, which they argue has been rushed in an effort to get the judge seated before the midterms. Republicans, including Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell, see their success in putting conservatives on the bench, especially the Supreme Court, as a strong campaign message to their base voters.Liberal activists have also put heavy pressure on Democrats to oppose the nomination, concerned about Judge Kavanaugh's views on abortion rights, executive power and government regulation.Most Senate Democrats have already signaled opposition to the nomination, though several who are running for re-election this year in states won by Mr. Trump were believed to be possible ""yes"" votes before the accusations of sexual assault were made public."
wsj,Senators Brace for Report By FBI --- Move by McConnell could clear way for final vote on Kavanaugh as early as Saturday,"WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell set up a critical procedural vote Friday on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as senators prepared to scrutinize an FBI report into allegations of sexual assault against the nominee.Mr. McConnell (R., Ky.) said the Senate would receive the FBI supplemental background investigation into Judge Kavanaugh late Wednesday. He said senators would have time starting Thursday morning to review bureau's findings before voting later this week.Friday's vote is expected to indicate whether the nominee has the 50 votes he would need for confirmation, with Republican Vice President Mike Pence breaking a 50-50 tie. If Republicans prevail on Friday, a final vote could come as early as Saturday.""We need to end this. This has gotten beyond the absurd,"" said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber's second-ranking Republican.Late Wednesday, the White House found no corroboration of the allegations after examining interview reports from the FBI, according to people familiar with the matter. It was unclear whether the White House had completed its review of the FBI interview reports. A White House spokesman declined to comment.Senators of both parties have voiced dismay at the personal tenor of the confirmation fight since Christine Blasey Ford, a California psychology professor, came forward on Sept. 16 to allege that Judge Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, which he categorically denied. The dispute appears to be nearing its conclusion, but senators said they worried the wounds it opened may linger for years.As the end approached, it remained unclear whether Judge Kavanaugh would have the support to be confirmed, given the GOP's narrow 51-49 advantage in the Senate. Three crucial Republican senators have said their decision would depend in part on the findings of the Federal Bureau of Investigation report.Mr. McConnell has said the report won't be made public, and it isn't expected to draw explicit conclusions, so senators could take different messages from it.Judiciary committee staff will be briefed on the FBI report on Thursday morning, separated by party, with Republicans going first. The Democratic and Republican caucuses will then have separate briefings from staff.The report will be held in a secure room. Senators and staffers will not be allowed to speak publicly about details contained in the report.Before the report's completion, Democrats said they were concerned that the investigation wouldn't be comprehensive. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the fact that the FBI apparently wasn't interviewing Judge Kavanaugh or Dr. Ford, among others, ""raises serious concerns that this is not a credible investigation.""No matter the outcome, the fight is on track to leave behind a divided country, a potentially more politicized Supreme Court and continued disagreement on who was victimized.Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) said he talked to his colleagues at a bipartisan prayer breakfast on Wednesday about repairing their relationships.Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) said Judge Kavanaugh's attacks on Democrats at last week's hearing could cause lasting damage.""I really worry about how Kavanaugh's exposed himself as a partisan because I think that will provide incentive for a Democratic president to put a blatant, unrepentant partisan up for confirmation as well,"" he said.With the tension in the Senate high, and lawmakers, such as Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) surrounded by extra security, Mr. McConnell cast Republicans as the targets.""There's no chance in the world they're going to scare us out of doing our duty,"" he said on the Senate floor. ""I don't care how many members they chase, how many people they harass here in the halls.. . .We will not be intimidated by these people.""The FBI report will cover allegations brought by Dr. Ford and Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate who told the New Yorker that Judge Kavanaugh exposed himself to her in college. Judge Kavanaugh has denied Ms. Ramirez's allegations.Besides Ms. Collins, GOP Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska haven't committed to supporting the nominee. Among Democrats, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota -- both facing re-election in states that voted heavily for President Trump -- are publicly undecided.FBI agents have interviewed three people Dr. Ford said were at the social gathering where the alleged assault took place. The bureau also questioned two friends Judge Kavanaugh named in his 1982 calendar, Tim Gaudette and Chris Garrett, known as ""Squi,"" according to their lawyers.Judge Kavanaugh's calendar indicated that on July 1, 1982, he went to ""Timmy's"" house for ""skis w/Judge, Tom, PJ, Bernie, Squi."" He told lawmakers the entry was a reference to brewskis, or beers, at Mr. Gaudette's home.Investigators haven't interviewed Dr. Ford, her attorneys said Wednesday.Asked why he thought the FBI didn't reach out to the key accuser, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said that investigators could review transcripts from the hearing.Several Republicans criticized Mr. Trump on Wednesday for mocking Dr. Ford's testimony at a political rally in Mississippi late Tuesday. The GOP president cited a series of details he said she couldn't recall about the alleged incident.""How did you get home? I don't remember,"" Mr. Trump asked, mimicking a questioner at last week's hearing and Dr. Ford's response. He continued in that vein.Mr. Flake was sharply critical.""There is no time and no place for remarks like that, but to discuss something this sensitive at a political rally is just not right,"" he said on NBC. ""I wish he hadn't done it, and I just say it's kind of appalling.""White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the president was simply ""stating the facts that Dr. Ford herself laid out in her testimony."""
wsj,U.S. News: Ford Friend Felt Pressure to Revisit View,"A friend of Christine Blasey Ford told FBI investigators that she felt pressured by Dr. Ford's allies to revisit her initial statement that she knew nothing about an alleged sexual assault by a teenage Brett Kavanaugh, which she later updated to say that she believed but couldn't corroborate Dr. Ford's account, according to people familiar with the matter.Leland Keyser, who Dr. Ford has said was present at the gathering where she was allegedly assaulted in the 1980s, told investigators that Monica McLean, a retired Federal Bureau of Investigation agent and a friend of Dr. Ford's, had urged her to clarify her statement, the people said.The statement to the FBI offers a glimpse into how Dr. Ford's allies were working behind the scenes to lobby old classmates to bolster their versions of the alleged incident, as were Judge Kavanaugh's.Judge Kavanaugh, whose Supreme Court nomination will be debated in the Senate Friday, has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct.On Thursday, a day after sending to the White House the report on its investigation into the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, the FBI sent the White House and Senate an additional package of information that included text messages from Ms. McLean to Ms. Keyser, according to a person familiar with the matter.Ms. McLean's lawyer, David Laufman, said in a statement: ""Any notion or claim that Ms. McLean pressured Leland Keyser to alter Ms. Keyser's account of what she recalled concerning the alleged incident between Dr. Ford and Brett Kavanaugh is absolutely false.""Ms. Keyser's lawyer on Sept. 23 said in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she had no recollection of attending a party with Judge Kavanaugh, whom she said she didn't know. That same day, however, she told the Washington Post that she believed Dr. Ford. On Sept. 29, two days after Dr. Ford and the judge testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ms. Keyser's attorney sent a letter to the panel saying his client wasn't refuting Dr. Ford's account and that she believed it but couldn't corroborate it.A person close to the former classmates said it was her understanding that mutual friends of Dr. Ford and Ms. Keyser, including Ms. McLean, had contacted Ms. Keyser after her initial statement to warn her that her statement was being used by Republicans to rebut the allegation against Judge Kavanaugh. The friends told Ms. Keyser that if she had intended to say she didn't remember the party -- not that it had never happened -- that she should clarify her statement, the person said, adding that the friends hadn't ""pressured"" Ms. Keyser.Judge Kavanaugh and his allies also lobbied former classmates to defend him. Ahead of a Sept. 23 New Yorker article about an allegation by Deborah Ramirez that Judge Kavanaugh had exposed himself to her in their freshman year at Yale, a former classmate, Karen Yarasavage, said she had gotten a call from ""Brett's guy"" and that ""Brett asked me to go on record,"" according to a memo about the conversation by another former classmate. Ms. Yarasavage is quoted anonymously in the New Yorker piece, the memo said. The judge denied the claim that he exposed himself.Judge Kavanaugh, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed Thursday, said he had been ""subjected to wrongful and sometimes vicious allegations"" and that his youth had been ""ridiculously distorted.""If confirmed, he wrote, he would ""keep an open mind in every case, and always strive to preserve the Constitution.""Ms. Keyser's interview with the FBI -- which is subject to perjury laws -- may influence the Senate debate on the judge's confirmation. Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), who has said he would vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, told reporters earlier Thursday that he found the most significant interviews in the FBI report to be those from people close to Dr. Ford who wanted to corroborate her account and were ""sympathetic in wishing they could, but they could not.""Howard Walsh, a lawyer for Ms. Keyser, declined to comment.The FBI declined to comment on the investigation.There is no indication Dr. Ford and her legal team were involved in any effort to discuss Ms. Keyser's statement with her, according to people familiar with the matter"
wsj,Susan Collins Consents,"With no small sense of the dramatic moment, Maine Senator Susan Collins waited until the final words of her more than 30-minute floor speech Friday to announce her intention to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Moments after she finished, West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin used the less elevated platform of Twitter to say that he, too, will vote to confirm.This likely means the Senate will vote Saturday in favor of Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation. We say ""likely"" because rarely has the famous Yogi Berra saying been more true that it isn't over until it's over. With Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski defecting for reasons apparently known only to her, the vote to confirm sits at a still precarious 51 votes. Would anyone be the least bit surprised if the Democrats produced another Kavanaugh accuser before Saturday's vote? Or maybe another former Supreme Court Justice? (See nearby.)That is a low thought, but this was very much on Senator Collins's mind during her speech on the floor of the Senate. Her opening words went straight at the politics of the process.The confirmation process, she said, ""has hit rock bottom."" She said the Kavanaugh confirmation ""looked more like a caricature of a gutter-level political campaign than a solemn occasion.""She described the campaign against Judge Kavanaugh as driven by a frenzy of special-interest groups that spread outright falsehoods that produced dramatic headlines and were spread by social media.Having said that, she brought up advice and consent. Remember that?Advice and consent is the authority that Article II of the Constitution gives the U.S. Senate to confirm persons nominated to high office by the President. Senator Collins used her floor speech as a case study in advice and consent.She reviewed Judge Kavanaugh's record on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on a range of issues: the Affordable Care Act, the doctrine of severability when part of a law is found to be unconstitutional, presidential powers, same-sex marriage, Roe v. Wade and its related Supreme Court cases and the judge's independence from political influence.Senator Collins agreed with some of Judge Kavanaugh's positions, disagreed with others, and expressed her hope or expectation that he would not depart from her own views on matters such as abortion rights.In short, the speech was a U.S. Senator weighing a nominee's objective, known record against her own beliefs and politics. This, presumably, is the practical meaning of advice and consent.Any observer of the events of the past four weeks is aware that the Kavanaugh nomination process broke free of those traditional advice-and-consent boundaries. And so Senator Collins then also addressed the heart of the last-minute controversy over Judge Kavanaugh's nomination -- the accusation of sexual assault made against him by Christine Blasey Ford.There has never been any dispute, even from Ms. Ford's advocates, that no corroboration has been put forward for her accusations. The Judiciary Committee's Democrats made clear that the accusation alone was sufficient reason to reject Judge Kavanaugh.Given the emotional fires that have burned around this central issue, it is worth quoting Senator Collins's response in full:""Certain fundamental legal principles about due process, the presumption of innocence and fairness do bear on my thinking and I cannot abandon them. In evaluating any given claim of misconduct, we will be ill-served in the long run if we abandon innocence and fairness, tempting though it may be. We must always remember that it is when passions are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy."" The presumption of innocence, she said, ""is relevant to the advice and consent function.""This was a bracing and important moment. Senator Collins was asserting that even by the enormously flexible standards of American political give-and-take, the case against Judge Kavanaugh had gone too far. The current atmosphere, she said, ""would have alarmed the drafters of our Constitution."" Her seriousness and thoroughness on the floor of the Senate notably contrasted with the superficial analysis of so many other Senators of both political parties.This was in many ways an old-fashioned Senate floor speech espousing ideas about governance that obviously strike many today as old-fashioned. They are not. The Senator from Maine deserves gratitude for drawing her colleagues and the rest of us back to the meaning of political responsibility."
wsj,U.S. News: The Man Behind the Nominee's Strategy: Don McGahn,"WASHINGTON -- Waiting his turn to testify last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Brett Kavanaugh had a private word with White House counsel Don McGahn, who has been shepherding his Supreme Court nomination. Mr. McGahn cleared the holding room of staff, people familiar with the matter said.Christine Blasey Ford had just told senators that Judge Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were teens, and White House aides worried her account was compelling. Sitting with Judge Kavanaugh and his wife, Mr. McGahn told him he shouldn't hold back: When facing the senators he should show his true feelings about accusations that he said are false, the people said.Judge Kavanaugh offered an impassioned and raw defense of his career and character. It isn't clear yet whether the approach worked. Some senators say they were put off by Judge Kavanaugh's combative tone, questioning whether he has the temperament to serve on the high court. But President Trump said he was pleased by the performance.As the Senate vote on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination nears, the verdict will be a referendum of sorts on a strategy devised by Mr. McGahn, who is slated to step down from the White House once the drama is resolved. Both Mr. McGahn and Judge Kavanaugh declined to comment for this article.Mr. McGahn took a risk after Dr. Ford first went public with the allegations, advising that Judge Kavanaugh give a TV interview to rebut the charges on a bigger public forum, a White House official said. Putting a Supreme Court nominee on television before the confirmation vote is unprecedented in modern times. In the Fox News interview, Judge Kavanaugh leaned on talking points and presented himself as a model teen -- an image at odds with some classmates' later depictions of him as a hard-partying student.Still, White House officials, who have been monitoring focus groups measuring political fallout from the Kavanaugh nomination, say the TV appearance galvanized older women voters who are part of the president's political base.From the first, the White House has described the Kavanaugh nomination as a campaign with Mr. McGahn in the role of day-to-day manager and chairman. Mr. McGahn comes out of conservative legal circles and had admired Judge Kavanaugh's writings on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, a person familiar with the matter said.Since the nomination in July, the men have worked in tandem. The White House counsel accompanied the judge to Capitol Hill for days of courtesy calls to senators. When Judge Kavanaugh first testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. McGahn sat behind him.At a preparation session before testifying last week about the sexual-assault allegations, Judge Kavanaugh spoke to the assembled aides and sought to break the tension. Anticipating practice questions about his sex life and drinking habits, he said: ""You're about to learn more about me than you ever wanted to know,"" according to people familiar with the matter.Judge Kavanaugh recently engaged behind the scenes after learning of a New Yorker magazine article being prepared that would describe an alleged incident at Yale University in which a classmate, Deborah Ramirez, said he exposed himself to her at a drunken party. Mr. Kavanaugh has denied the accusation.In a memo about text messages she exchanged with fellow former Yale classmates ahead of the article's publication, Kerry Berchem described frequent contacts between Judge Kavanaugh, his team and his former classmates, according to a copy of the document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal."
wsj,The Never Conservatives,"Donald Trump didn't help Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation with his crude mockery of Christine Blasey Ford on Tuesday night in Tennessee, but then this Supreme Court moshpit isn't about this President. The left's all-out assault on the judge is clarifying because it shows that the ""resistance"" is really about anything and everything conservative in America. Mr. Trump is its foil to regain power.Brett Kavanaugh isn't part of Mr. Trump's New York menagerie, or some Steve Bannon insurgent. The judge is the epitome of the GOP legal establishment, a Supreme Court nominee from central casting. He went to the best schools and served his apprenticeship among legal elites including a clerkship with former Justice Anthony Kennedy.He has spent 26 years in public service instead of cashing in as a Beltway lawyer. He served at the highest levels of George W. Bush's White House staff in positions of great trust. On the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals for 12 years, he has written more than 300 opinions and had at least 10 adopted by the Supreme Court. He has taught at Harvard Law School at the invitation of then dean, and now Justice, Elena Kagan.With these credentials Judge Kavanaugh would have been on any Republican's short list for the Supreme Court. He could have been Jeb Bush's nominee, or John Kasich's, though Mr. Kasich in the ambitious ebb of his career now tilts with the anti-conservative left against Mr. Kavanaugh. In 2012 the New Yorker's Jeffrey Toobin wrote that Mr. Kavanaugh would have been Mitt Romney's ""most likely first nominee"" for the High Court. Mr. Toobin, who loathes conservatives, meant it as a warning.---Mr. Trump's nomination of Mr. Kavanaugh is a credit to the process he established to win the election and govern with conservative support. He sought the help of legal elites on the right, led by the Federalist Society, who compiled an impressive list of potential nominees. This isn't a rogue judicial operation to choose presidential cronies. It is the gold standard for legal talent that believes in the original meaning of the Constitution. It's hard to see how any GOP President would have done better, and others have done much worse.Yet this is precisely why Democrats and the left have set out to destroy Judge Kavanaugh -- not in legal philosophy or competence, which they knew was a political loser, but as a human being, a spouse and father. They need to destroy him personally with accusations but no corroboration, as they tried with Clarence Thomas, so they can deny the open Supreme Court seat to a judicial conservative.So much the better if playing the #MeToo card also helps Democrats retake Congress. In this sense too, Mr. Trump is the left's foil, though the Kavanaugh fight has usefully exposed the dishonesty of the loud worries about Mr. Trump's threat to ""democratic norms.""Democrats were so worried about Senate norms that they hid Ms. Ford's name from Republicans for six weeks, found her a lawyer, midwifed a lie detector test whose results they still haven't fully disclosed, and then orchestrated the rollout of her accusations. Mr. Trump's rhetoric is too often divisive and dissembling, but no action in his Presidency comes close to matching the partisan viciousness of the Senate ambush of Brett Kavanaugh. These are today's Democratic norms.The other Democratic targets here are Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell and the conservative GOP majorities in Congress that have cut taxes, eased crushing regulations and confirmed a record number of appellate judges. Democrats claim to want to be a ""check"" on Mr. Trump, but good luck with that.Their real goal is to retake Capitol Hill, roll back tax reform, expand the entitlement state, taunt Mr. Trump like a dancing bear, and set up 2020 for a return of the Obama agenda under the identity-politics leadership of Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren.---The media sometimes profess to be puzzled that more than 80% of Republicans across the country tell pollsters they support Mr. Trump despite his personal flaws. The Never Conservatives are the reason, and the assault on Judge Kavanaugh is the latest showcase of their methods. Republicans have figured out that if the left can willfully, even gleefully, destroy a man as distinguished as Brett Kavanaugh, they can and will do it to any conservative who threatens their grip on power.Republicans are well aware of Mr. Trump's excesses and falsehoods. But they have also come to understand that the resistance to him isn't rooted in principle or some august call to superior character. They know Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton in 2016 despite her history of deceit. Voters know this is about the left's will to power by any means necessary.Republicans across America can see, and certainly their Senators voting on Judge Kavanaugh should realize, that the left hates them as much or more than they loathe Mr. Trump. Conservatives understand that, for the American left, they are all deplorables now."
wsj,U.S. News: Hearing Rivets The Nation and Its Legislators,"WASHINGTON -- Wrenching back-to-back appearances by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of sexual assault, riveted the Capitol Thursday in a day of angry, often-personal exchanges and emotional testimony.Judge Kavanaugh, who appeared after Dr. Ford, swerved between teary references to his family and fiery lambasting of Democrats for demanding an investigation into the late-surfacing allegations against him in a nearly hourlong opening defense. He maintained his defiant tone during questioning, on occasion interrupting senators to turn their questions back on them.""This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups,"" Mr. Kavanaugh said.He choked up several times during his remarks, as had Dr. Ford when she spoke earlier. A psychology professor, Dr. Ford used a mix of clinical and emotional terms to describe the effect the alleged assault had on her life.""Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter, the uproarious laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense,"" Dr. Ford said, referring to her account of Judge Kavanaugh and a friend, Mark Judge, allegedly jumping on her and pinning her to the bed.Across the nation, Americans altered their routines Thursday to watch Dr. Ford's testimony and Judge Kavanaugh's impassioned response.At the historic Players Retreat restaurant in Raleigh, N.C., a small group of women reserved the private pool-table room to watch the hearing over sandwiches and salads.""To think how brave she is, it's overwhelming to me,"" said Ella Frantz, a mother of grown children and Democratic activist. ""People, maybe now, will have a voice and will come forward and tell their story.""Ms. Frantz later said she was glued to Mr. Kavanaugh's testimony and found it compelling, especially as he described his pain as a father, son, husband and professional whose reputation was at risk.If Dr. Ford's accusations aren't true, ""this is terrible,"" she said. ""But then I go back and think, there's nothing in it for her.""Dr. Ford said she first divulged details of the alleged assault to her husband in couples therapy in 2012, after they disagreed over whether to build a second front door to their home. She insisted on it, she said, because the incident as a teenager left her so anxious and claustrophobic.Dr. Ford also fleshed out another alleged encounter, describing Mr. Judge's reaction when she bumped into him at a grocery store six to eight weeks after the alleged assault. ""I said hello to him, and his face was white and very uncomfortable saying hello back,"" she said.The hearing's asymmetrical structure contributed to its extraordinary nature. Republicans, eager to avoid the spectacle of 11 GOP men interrogating Dr. Ford, hired an outside counsel, Rachel Mitchell, a sex-crimes prosecutor from Arizona, to question her. Democratic senators questioned her themselves.As the two sides alternated questions, Ms. Mitchell's calm, methodical questions were interspersed with Democrats' broader, more impassioned political remarks.Once Judge Kavanaugh took the stand, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) gave a speech angrily attacking his Democratic colleagues, and other Republicans began questioning the nominee themselves.His comments were striking in a chamber that has long valued collegiality. ""What you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold his seat open, and hope you win in 2020,"" Sen. Graham said.That accusation of intentional delay echoed the frustration many Democrats voiced at the fate of Judge Merrick Garland, whom Senate Republicans refused to consider after President Obama nominated him to the Supreme Court in March 2016.As many questions focused on Judge Kavanaugh's high-school behavior, several senators pressed the nominee on how much he drank and whether he ever blacked out.""Sometimes I had too many beers. I liked beer. I still like beer,"" Mr. Kavanaugh said. ""But I did not drink beer to the point of blacking out, and I never sexually assaulted anyone."""
wsj,Democrats Disgrace the Senate,"Thursday will be an immensely consequential day for America. As of this writing, Christine Blasey Ford is scheduled to appear in the morning before the Senate Judiciary Committee, followed by Judge Brett Kavanaugh. They both deserve to be heard, but the hearing could devolve into a circus.Sen. Dianne Feinstein could have avoided this chaos if she'd acted properly in July after receiving Ms. Ford's letter alleging Mr. Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a party of teenagers in the early 1980s. Mrs. Feinstein could have promptly delivered the letter to the FBI so agents could interview Ms. Ford, Judge Kavanaugh and the people she claims were present. Their responses would have been included in the judge's confidential background check.The Judiciary Committee could then have privately considered all the facts -- including that Ms. Ford can't remember when or where the alleged assault took place, and that the three people Ms. Ford claims attended the party all deny any recollection of it. Ms. Ford would have kept her anonymity and Judge Kavanaugh his reputation.But Mrs. Feinstein -- who finds herself in a difficult re-election campaign -- placed venomous partisanship above fair play and professionalism. She has brought dishonor to her decades in the Senate.Now comes an accusation in the New Yorker that Mr. Kavanaugh exposed himself to Deborah Ramirez at a Yale drinking session, and another, even more salacious allegation from ""resistance"" celebrity attorney Michael Avenatti. The New York Times earlier took a pass on Ms. Ramirez's story after interviewing ""several dozen people"" without finding any who could corroborate it. They also discovered she recently told classmates she wasn't certain Mr. Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself, asking them to confirm it. (According to the New Yorker story, Ms. Ramirez ""was at first hesitant to speak publicly, partly because her memories contained gaps because she had been drinking."" She ""felt confident"" of her story only ""after six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney."")Judge Kavanaugh had already undergone two extensive FBI background checks, one when he joined the White House staff and another when nominated to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. None of these allegations were raised either time.Senate Democrats seem to be competing to debase themselves most. Shouting at Chairman Chuck Grassley, Sen. Kamala Harris looked like she's already campaigning for president. Sen. Cory Booker (D., Thrace) repeatedly and defiantly boasted that he'd make public confidential documents -- whose release the committee had already authorized. Sen. Dick Durbin vacuously praised lawbreakers disrupting the hearing as the ""noise of democracy.""When running for the Senate in 2010, Richard Blumenthal falsely told constituents he had served in Vietnam. He now claims Judge Kavanaugh lacks credibility and so has ""a responsibility to come forward with evidence"" rebutting Ms. Ford -- that is, responsibility to prove a negative.But when it comes to recklessness it's hard to outdo Sen. Mazie Hirono, who told male colleagues and the men of America to ""shut up"" and ""do the right thing for a change,"" which is to believe Ms. Ford regardless of facts. Like the Queen of Hearts, she believes ""Sentence first -- verdict afterwards."" When asked about Judge Kavanaugh's denials, Ms. Hirono suggested he's not entitled to the presumption of innocence because of his conservative judicial philosophy. She then signed a fundraising appeal for MoveOn.org to help make Judge Kavanaugh's nomination ""an electoral issue . . . to make sure this costs Republicans extra seats.""Senate Judiciary Democrats have endorsed as acceptable (1) disruptive tactics unworthy of even a Third World country, (2) the presumption of guilt instead of innocence, and (3) determining a man guilty by accusation alone, even if the weight of evidence points the other way, so long as it suits their ideological agenda. Republicans should refuse to bow to such methods. They should also decline to resort to them when the tables are turned.Both parties will suffer politically if they lose. The Republican base will be furious at its leadership if Judge Kavanaugh is defeated or his nomination withdrawn. The Democratic base will be demoralized if he is confirmed -- although it will also use his presence on the Supreme Court to gin up turnout among liberal women and attack the GOP.I know Brett Kavanaugh, who is a former White House colleague. In hard times for our nation after 9/11, I came to deeply admire Brett's character, intellect and integrity. His reputation was spotless until Democrats began acting like a mob. Judge Kavanaugh deserves better than this sordid process. More importantly, the country does."
wsj,U.S. News: Inside the Room: Key Exchanges,"Some notable moments in Thursday's hearing:Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.): You were very clear about the attack. Being pushed into the room, you say you don't know quite by whom, but that it was Brett Kavanaugh that covered your mouth to prevent you from screaming, and then you escaped. How are you so sure that it was he?Dr. Christine Blasey Ford: The same way that I'm sure that I'm talking to you right now. It's -- just basic memory functions. And also just the level of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the brain that, sort of, as you know, encodes -- that neurotransmitter encodes memories into the hippocampus. And so, the trauma-related experience, then, is kind of locked there, whereas other details kind of drift.Sen. Feinstein: So what you are telling us is this could not be a case of mistaken identity?Dr. Ford: Absolutely not.---Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.): What is the strongest memory you have, the strongest memory of the incident, something that you cannot forget?Dr. Ford: Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter, the laugh -- the uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense.---Rachel Mitchell: Have you also educated yourself on the best way to get to memory and truth, in terms of interviewing victims of trauma? . . . Would you believe me if I told you that there's no study that says that this setting in five-minute increments is the best way to do that?(laughter)Ford attorney Michael Bromwich: We'll stipulate to that.---Judge Brett Kavanaugh: There is a bright line between drinking beer, which I gladly do, and which I fully embrace, and sexually assaulting someone, which is a violent crime. If every American who drinks beer or every American who drank beer in high school is suddenly presumed guilty of sexual assault, will be an ugly, new place in this country. I never committed sexual assault.---Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.): You started off with an impassioned statement at the beginning, and I can imagine -- try to imagine what you have been through and your family has been through and I'm sure I wouldn't get close to it.Judge Kavanaugh: No, you wouldn't.Sen. Durbin: I'm sure I wouldn't. It's an impassioned statement, and in the course of it you said I welcome any kind of investigation. I quote you.I've got a suggestion for you: Right now, turn to your left in the front row to Don McGahn, counsel to President Donald Trump. Ask him to suspend this hearing and nomination process until the FBI completes its investigation of the charges made by Dr. Ford and others.---Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.): Do you consider that you've been through a job interview?Judge Kavanaugh: I've been through a process of advice and consent under the Constitution which --Sen. Graham: Would you say you've been through hell?Judge Kavanaugh: I've been through hell and then some.Sen. Graham: This is not a job interview. This is hell. This is going to destroy the ability of good people to come forward because of this crap.---Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah): I hate to say this but this is worse than Robert Bork, and I didn't think it could get any worse than that. This is worse than Clarence Thomas, and I didn't think it could get any worse than that. This is a national disgrace the way you're being treated."
wsj,Tomorrow's Elite Lawyers Disavow Due Process,"At last count more than 1,700 law professors have signed an open letter complaining that Judge Brett Kavanaugh ""displayed a lack of judicial temperament"" in responding to uncorroborated sexual assault accusations against him. In his 12 years on the federal bench, Judge Kavanaugh has produced ample evidence of his judicial temperament. If anyone's temperament should be of concern to these professors, it's that of their students, enthralled by identity politics and victim ideology.Immediately after President Trump nominated Judge Kavanaugh in July, hundreds of Yale law students, alumni and faculty signed a petition claiming the nomination presented an ""emergency . . . for our safety."" When Christine Blasey Ford's allegations became public in September, Yale law students convened a town hall to combat a ""culture"" on campus ""that privileges power and prestige over safety and wellness, [and] that precludes many of us from flourishing in this space.""When the New Yorker published its own uncorroborated account of lewd conduct purportedly committed by Mr. Kavanaugh as a Yale freshman, Yale law-school alumnae organized an open letter supporting ""all women who have faced sexual assault, not only at Yale, but across the country."" Thirty-one Yale law professors canceled classes to facilitate student protests against Judge Kavanaugh, both in New Haven and on Capitol Hill. The Office of Student Affairs put out a plate of cookies to let students ""know we are thinking of you.""Not to be outdone, Harvard law students walked out of their classes the day after the New Yorker article appeared, wearing pink buttons declaring ""I Believe Christine Blasey Ford."" America must ""stand by these survivors,"" the president of the Harvard Black Law Students Association told the crowd. The dean of students announced, ""We are supporting our students as they grapple with these issues."" Whether she provided cookies is unknown.Judge Kavanaugh has taught a three-week course at Harvard every January since 2008. Nearly 1,000 Harvard Law alumni signed a petition saying his presence on campus now would send a message to female students that powerful men are above the law. In a letter to the dean, some first-year law students claimed that allowing Mr. Kavanaugh to teach would create a ""hostile environment for many students, and especially survivors."" Several undergraduates filed Title IX complaints on the same grounds, according to the Harvard Crimson. Earlier this week Judge Kavanaugh announced that he won't teach the class in 2019. His faculty page has been scrubbed from the school's website.The Kavanaugh hysteria has provided the country with a crash course in academic victim politics. The tribal denunciations of ""privileged white males,"" the moral panic over fantastical accounts of sexual predation, the spectacle of Ivy League law students claiming to feel ""unsafe,"" the assertion that a single uncorroborated outbreak of male teen hormones should cancel a lifetime of achievement in the law -- all originate in the anti-Enlightenment ethos of the academy, embodied in critical race studies, feminist legal theory, and the attacks on the Socratic teaching method as anti-female and anti-""survivor.""The GBP BelieveSurvivors mantra is a cornerstone of the campus grievance industry but inimical to everything that a law school should teach. It's a religious gesture, not a legal one: Such belief is independent of proof, arising out of a pre-existing commitment to a narrative of ubiquitous female abuse by patriarchal white males. The ""survivor"" label presupposes the conclusion that evidence should establish: that the accused is guilty of an offense. The fact-finder, if there even is one, regards contradictions or holes in a woman's story as evidence of ""trauma"" and thus as further corroboration. According to GBP BelieveSurvivors logic, the Innocence Project, which exists to vacate wrongful convictions and has a presence at law schools across the country, should be disbanded.Examples abound of student rape allegations arising out of voluntary drunken hookups, following which the self-described victim sought further sexual contact with her alleged rapist. Even if such cases weren't so common, to presume the guilt of the accused based on an accusation alone would still be an affront to due process.The current generation of elite law students will one day become judges themselves. If they remain committed to the circular logic of GBP BelieveSurvivors, the rule of law is in trouble."
wsj,The GOP Can't Win for Losing,"As the battle over Brett Kavanaugh rages on, pundits continue to speculate about what an unproven sexual-misconduct claim might mean for the future makeup of the Supreme Court, for subsequent nominations and for the credibility of the #MeToo movement.In the halls of Capitol Hill, the question centers on a much more immediate and political question: the fate of the Republican Party. The overwhelming verdict -- on right and left -- is that if Judge Kavanaugh goes down, so too does the GOP in the upcoming midterms.For now, the distinguished circuit-court judge is on track for confirmation. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley has handled Christine Blasey Ford's 36-year-old accusation with enormous accommodation, inviting her to give evidence in any manner of her choosing -- a public or private hearing, in Washington or California, in person or over the phone. Her decision to join with partisan Democratic calls for an FBI investigation, and her refusal to provide testimony in any form for a Monday hearing, has troubled Republican senators who insisted she be heard.Tennessee's Bob Corker put the point clearly in a tweet on Monday: ""Republicans extended a hand in good faith. If we don't hear from both sides on Monday, let's vote."" Even undecided Republican senators understand the Democratic playbook and appreciate how unjust it would be to allow a vague, uncorroborated claim to derail Judge Kavanaugh's career and reputation -- especially if his accuser won't even put her claims in the Senate record.But with Democrats and their media allies stopping at nothing to derail this nomination, even confident Republicans have been forced to consider the prospect of a defeat. A few GOP optimists, inside and outside the White House, are spreading the claim that a Kavanaugh loss could have a midterm upside. The argument: Candidates would light up the base by highlighting Democrats' ambush tactics. President Trump would name a new nominee, and voters would rush to the polls to guarantee a GOP Senate and an ultimate confirmation.And then a flock of porcine wonders will fly.Wiser Republicans note there's a reason Spartacus & Co. are working so hard to defeat this nomination. It's partly because they despise Judge Kavanaugh's philosophy and fear a fifth conservative on the high court. It's partly because they want to spare their red-state colleagues a difficult choice before the midterms. But it is mostly because it is a fabulous issue with the Democratic base. Nothing would more energize that part of the electorate than a Kavanaugh scalp.It would signal the ""resistance"" is effective and spur an avalanche of votes for liberal candidates who promise continued obstruction of Mr. Trump's agenda. Democrats will promise that Senate control would allow them to block any replacement nominee as well and keep the seat open until Democrats take the presidency in 2020. For voters still smarting over Merrick Garland, that's the ultimate motivator.Republican voters? Oh yes, the base is furious over the Democratic treatment of Judge Kavanaugh. They are angry over the theatrical and uncivil hearings. They are riled up over this late and dirty Democratic hit, the releasing of an accuser's letter months after it was first obtained.But listen to those base voters on Twitter, on radio, in public forums. They are prepared to release most of their rage over any Kavanaugh defeat on the Republican Party. One of their abiding complaints is that GOP politicians too easily succumb to liberal tactics. It is among the most-cited reasons they voted for Mr. Trump -- that (for better or worse) he doesn't back down. And while some are tolerant of a process that allows this accuser to speak, what the base mostly sees is an old, unsubstantiated, unprovable claim, and a partisan smear designed to deny a duly elected president his Supreme Court pick.These voters handed Republicans control of the White House and Congress in large part to oversee these Supreme Court fights. Republicans have 51 votes, a sterling candidate, and no excuses. Good luck to any GOP candidate who turns around and promises a new nominee after a Kavanaugh fail. Why would or should voters believe Republicans would get it done the next time? Especially given that Democrats know they can repeat the ambush exercise. Among the reasons base Republicans lag Democrats in enthusiasm for this election is bitterness that the GOP failed in core promises to repeal ObamaCare and to restrain spending. A blown Supreme Court nominee would make matters far worse.A newly minted Justice Kavanaugh is a crucial part of any winning 2018 message. His confirmation would be proof Republicans are willing to fight for and fulfill promises. It won't guarantee that they'll win the midterms and retain their majorities. But it will guard against the drubbing they'd receive from their own voters if they bow now to Chuck Schumer's underhanded tactics."
wsj,Politicizing the FBI,"Democrats continue to demand an FBI investigation into Christine Blasey Ford's allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, and on Wednesday we explained their political goal to delay a confirmation vote past Election Day. But it's worth a moment to point out why this is also an inappropriate, even dangerous, attempt to politicize the bureau.Democrats want the FBI to ""investigate"" an alleged assault from 35 or 36 years ago as if it were a federal crime. But the confirmation of a judicial nominee is not a criminal event. It is a political process under which the Senate has the responsibility to exercise its advice and consent power.The FBI's role is to perform a background check that provides confidential information to the White House about the character and integrity of the nominee. In a criminal probe, FBI agents offer judgments in their reports about the credibility of the people they interview. But in background investigations, or BIs as they're called, the FBI does not provide commentary or issue judgments.And thank heaven because to do so would be to turn investigators into political judges. No matter how well intentioned, agents would have to include their subjective view of the information they collected, or the credibility of the witnesses they interviewed. This would inevitably corrupt the bureau and its agents, who are unelected career employees.Under the Constitution, the Senate is the ultimate judge of the fitness of a nominee appointed by the President. In this case Senators must assess whether they think Ms. Ford's allegations are credible enough to disqualify Judge Kavanaugh. The Senate can't abdicate that task to the FBI, much less order an executive branch agency to do its own advising and consenting.Chairman Chuck Grassley has established a process under which the Senators and their staff can ask the two parties directly about the events, judge their credibility, and then decide how to vote. This is the essence of political accountability.Some on the left are pointing to what they claim is the ""Anita Hill precedent"" because the FBI interviewed witnesses after she made her allegations against Clarence Thomas in 1991. But as Mr. Grassley pointed out Wednesday in a letter to Democrats, the FBI did that when Ms. Hill's allegations were still private. Judiciary Chairman Joe Biden promptly notified the White House, which directed the FBI to conduct a handful of interviews within a few days. After Ms. Hill's charges leaked, Mr. Biden reopened a hearing within five days.""We are in the same position the Committee was in after Professor Hill's allegations were leaked,"" writes Mr. Grassley. ""After that leak, we did not ask the FBI to conduct an investigation. Instead, we reopened the hearing and assessed the testimony that was given on our own. As in 1991, it is now up to the Senate to gather and assess the relevant evidence.""Republicans have offered Ms. Ford a fair process and forum, public or private, for her to be heard. Democrats have already done enough harm to the Senate's confirmation process without also politicizing the FBI."
wsj,Feinstein Plays Key Role in Accusation --- Senator who first ran after the Hill-Thomas hearings is at center of a similar drama,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein's moves that teed up a public airing of allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have drawn the ire of Republicans, who accuse the California Democrat of seeking to delay the nomination of a jurist she opposes, and the support of Democrats, who say she was trying to ensure a constituent's confidentiality on an issue that deserved scrutiny.Mrs. Feinstein told reporters Tuesday that the accusation by Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford that Judge Kavanaugh sexually abused her when they were teenagers ""ought to be looked at seriously, it ought to be investigated."" She added: ""This is an incident that can change a woman's life."" Judge Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Tuesday that Mrs. Feinstein's withholding of information about the allegations until the end of the confirmation process was deliberate. ""It's pretty obvious this is all about delaying the process,"" he said.Mrs. Feinstein set in motion the ultimate disclosure of Dr. Ford's charges, leading to a planned hearing Monday and complicating Judge Kavanaugh's nomination before senators vote.What began in late July, according to Mrs. Feinstein, as an effort to protect a constituent's confidentiality has become a public spectacle, for which she has faced criticism from Republicans and the White House for what they see as an effort to delay and imperil the nomination of a talented jurist.By Tuesday night, Dr. Ford's lawyers said that ""an FBI investigation of the incident should be the first step in addressing her allegations,"" or before any hearing. The statement, in a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), threw the Monday hearing into question. Judge Kavanaugh has been set to appear before the panel to defend himself from the charge and try to set his nomination back on course.Mrs. Feinstein learned of Dr. Ford's allegations in a July 30 letter that also requested confidentiality, according to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D., Calif.).Dr. Ford first contacted Ms. Eshoo, who encouraged her to reach out to Mrs. Feinstein. Ms. Eshoo also called the senator to discuss the matter, and Mrs. Feinstein asked that the allegations be described in a letter. The letter was sent to Ms. Eshoo's office and hand-delivered to Mrs. Feinstein's office.Once they received it, Mrs. Feinstein's aides approached the Senate Ethics Committee to inquire about whether the Judiciary panel could hire an independent, outside counsel to evaluate the allegations, according to Mrs. Feinstein's spokesman.They were told the Rules Committee would have to approve such a request, and the Republican chairmen of that panel and the Judiciary panel would have to sign off on the request -- an action that would have violated Dr. Ford's desire to remain anonymous.On Sept. 12, after meeting with Democrats on the committee, Mrs. Feinstein decided to forward the letter to the FBI in hopes of prompting an investigation.Dr. Ford then went public with her story, first telling it to the Washington Post.Mrs. Feinstein said on Tuesday that she didn't regret forwarding the letter.The public debate unfolds against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement that has exposed sexual abuse in many sectors, including the journalism and entertainment industries.It also comes less than two months before a hotly contested midterm election and less than two weeks before the start of a new Supreme Court term.Mrs. Feinstein herself is a heavy favorite to win a sixth Senate term and, at 85, remain the oldest sitting senator.She has said that she can recall joining a crowd watching the Anita Hill hearings on a television in London's Heathrow airport as a committee of white men grilled an African-American woman about her allegation that she had been sexually harassed.Mrs. Feinstein has said those hearings influenced her first Senate bid, and her candidacy was propelled by a backlash among women angered by the hostile treatment Ms. Hill received from the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 as she testified against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Justice Thomas denied the harassment charges, and was narrowly confirmed."
wsj,#MeToo Becomes a Political Ploy,"Pity Lady Justice; she's had a rough couple of weeks. On ""State of the Union"" Sunday, CNN's Jake Tapper tossed Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii what should have been a grapefruit: ""Doesn't Kavanaugh have the same presumption of innocence as anyone else in America?"" Ms. Hirono responded: ""I put his denial in the context of everything that I know about him in terms of how he approaches cases."" Conservative jurists in America have been put on notice: They are to forfeit their most basic rights as punishment for their judicial philosophy.In the national circus that is the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing, sexual assault is very much beside the point. Christine Blasey Ford claims that 36 years ago she suffered an attempt at the most terrifying act of brutality a woman can live through. But in the hands of Senate Democrats, this is one more bit of materiel flung at the other side. Ms. Ford is merely the expedient means to a desirable end.I have no idea what if anything happened to Ms. Ford. (Is it necessary to say this?) I have no idea whether she is more credible than Leland Keyser, whom Ms. Ford places at the party, though Ms. Keyser has no memory of it and says she's never met Brett Kavanaugh. Neither do any of the senators, including Dianne Feinstein, who learned of the accusation and withheld it from her Republican colleagues and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for six weeks, knowing as every good gunslinger must, that if you've only got one bullet left, you don't let it go to waste.Imagine if we treated murder this way. Imagine if a woman had written to Mrs. Feinstein alleging that the man who was about to be appointed to the Supreme Court had murdered her brother 36 years ago. What would we say of a senator who failed to turn this evidence over immediately to the authorities? That the question is so easily answered indicates how much less seriously we already take crimes of sexual violence.Mrs. Feinstein was elected in 1992, the year after Justice Clarence Thomas's appointment. When he was accused, we were told the woman is always right. Why else would Anita Hill have brought these claims? A few years later, when the accused was Bill Clinton, elite opinion cried we shouldn't rush to believe the accuser. He was a good feminist -- and Paula Jones, not nearly our sort of girl. In both cases, we knew that the point was not any of the accusations. It was to shelter powerful men with views we liked or punish men with views we didn't.Then came #MeToo. For a moment, it seemed everything might change. Public opinion was on the side, not of all women exactly, but of those women with credible, corroborated claims who were willing to name powerful men -- even those men with the right political allegiances. In this light, Bill O'Reilly and Harvey Weinstein seemed more alike than different; they met the same disgrace not for their political beliefs but for behavior that Americans of every political stripe should want to stop. For the first time in years, even Bill Clinton seemed less a gift to women than a Trojan Horse.But now we're back to our cheap tricks, using sexual assault as a political ploy. If Judge Kavanaugh were liberal, Sen. Hirono makes clear, she would give him the benefit of the doubt. If he adjudicates like a conservative, that's evidence of rape.This is not a fair hearing. This is not any hearing at all. This is a series of political stunts calling itself ""debate"" over who should sit on the Supreme Court. Those who believe a sole witness's inchoate recollection of a never-reported incident 36 years ago have every right to this instinct, but they cannot pretend to have seen sufficient evidence to adjudicate the matter. Not without corroboration or any pattern of similar acts by the accused. For those who are already convinced of Judge Kavanaugh's guilt, it is enough to believe no politically conservative Catholic -- ""some frat boy named Brett"" -- as NARAL called him -- should ever sit on the highest court of the land. Who but a monster would refuse to endorse the right to abortion? And isn't that tantamount to violence against women? What other evidence do we really need?Either we're going to take sexual assault seriously because we're interested in protecting women, or we'll allow it to be transformed into merely the newest political weapon. If we choose the latter, we will have encouraged victims and witnesses of even the most heinous crimes to decline to report them for decades, waiting for the politically opportune moment. And we will have helped turn a grievous crime into a cheap register of public passion that flips like a weather vane at the next election."
wsj,Senate Weighs Judge's Fate After Emotional Testimony,"WASHINGTON -- The fate of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court now hangs in the balance as senators weigh hours of emotional testimony from him and Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him of sexual assault.If Judge Kavanaugh is approved by the full Senate, he would be seated on the Supreme Court a few days after the start of the court's new term, which begins Oct. 1.If, however, Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation fails in the Senate, the White House would be forced to start the nomination process over, just weeks before the November midterm elections, in which the GOP is facing a challenge to retain the House and to some extent the Senate.Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats pushed for a delay in Friday's committee vote so the Federal Bureau of Investigation could delve into the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, which he again emphatically denied on Thursday. But Senate Republicans seethed that they had been forced to delay to hear from Dr. Ford and late Thursday said they planned to move forward with a committee vote on Friday morning.""What you want to do is destroy this guy's life,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) to Democrats in the hearing. ""This is the most unethical sham since I've been in politics and if you really wanted to know the truth you sure as hell wouldn't have done what you did to this guy.""President Trump stood by his nominee Thursday night, tweeting that ""Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him"" and adding: ""The Senate must vote!""A poor performance from Judge Kavanaugh at the hearing could have provoked Mr. Trump ""to start up a conversation about finding someone else,"" one of the president's advisers said.A White House official said Mr. Trump was ""very impressed"" with Judge Kavanaugh as the president watched the hearing in the White House residence. But some people close to the White House said that Mr. Trump could still lose patience with Judge Kavanaugh should Senate confirmation prospects crumble.Mr. Trump nominated Judge Kavanaugh over a short-list of other finalists who, White House aides concede, may have been more appealing to the president's conservative base.A day after Mr. Trump formally offered Judge Kavanaugh the nomination, the president was still phoning associates and checking to see if they believed he was the best choice, a person familiar with the matter said.If Judge Kavanaugh clears the Judiciary Committee on Friday, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) could keep the Senate in session over the weekend and make a nondebatable motion to call for a procedural vote.The Senate could take another procedural vote on Monday, and Democrats would likely insist on two days of debate time before a confirmation vote, meaning the confirmation vote could happen midweek.But wavering senators could be compelled by Dr. Ford's heartfelt testimony, where she said she was 100% confident that Judge Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge had pulled her into a room where Judge Kavanaugh groped her and attempted to remove her clothes during a party in the early 1980s. Mr. Judge has said he has no memory of the incident.Judge Kavanaugh needs 51 votes for confirmation, the same number of Republicans in the Senate. He has support from the majority of Republicans and is opposed by the Democratic caucus. A handful of senators are seen as possibly wavering on the nomination. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona haven't announced how they would vote.Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.) said she has ""great empathy and sympathy"" for Dr. Ford. ""I think she's giving very compelling testimony."" Asked if she found Dr. Ford credible, she said Dr. Ford ""hasn't strayed from her testimony or from her first accounting.""Several Democratic senators up for re-election from states that President Trump won in 2016 have also not said how they would vote on the nomination and could potentially support Judge Kavanaugh. The senators are facing enormous pressure to support the president's pick from their opponents and conservatives in their home states."
wsj,GOP Forges Ahead on Court Pick,"WASHINGTON -- Republicans rallied around embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, vowing Monday to push his confirmation through the Senate even as a new allegation of sexual misconduct emerged days before a hearing on an earlier assault claim.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) took to the Senate floor to call the allegations a ""smear campaign"" and promise a vote on the Senate floor to confirm the judge ""in the near future."" President Trump, in New York for a United Nations meeting Monday, reiterated his support for his second Supreme Court pick, saying, ""I am with him all the way.""The judge and his wife, Ashley Estes Kavanaugh, also took part in a Fox News interview Monday evening, using the forum to combat depictions of him as a predatory high school and college student, telling the network that he was a virgin into his 20s.""We're talking about an allegation of sexual assault,"" he said. ""I've never sexually assaulted anyone. I did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter.""Christine Blasey Ford, a California college professor, has accused him of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school during the 1980s. Judge Kavanaugh again denied the accusation but didn't question why Dr. Ford hadn't raised the issue publicly before now -- something President Trump has done.He said he wasn't worried about losing Mr. Trump's backing. The president called him on Monday, he said, and told him ""he's standing by me.""White House officials cast Judge Kavanaugh's Fox interview as part of a weeklong campaign to build momentum for his nomination that has been losing ground in public opinion. They plan to deploy high-ranking female officials in TV appearances, including press secretary Sarah Sanders and Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, a White House official said Monday.A WSJ/NBC survey released last week found that 38% of registered voters oppose the Kavanaugh nomination, up from 29% in a Journal/NBC poll last month.Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee renewed their call for postponing a hearing scheduled for Thursday that will feature testimony from Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford.Judge Kavanaugh, in a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R., Iowa), said he ""will not be intimidated into withdrawing"" his name from consideration for the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy.A letter from Dr. Ford to Mr. Grassley was also released Monday in which she agreed to appear before the committee despite death threats and being tailed while driving. ""While I am frightened, please know, my fear will not hold me back from testifying and you will be provided with answers to all of your questions. I ask for fair and respectful treatment,"" she wrote, saying also that Judge Kavanaugh's alleged actions ""have had a lasting impact on my life.""Democrats are also urging Mr. Grassley to investigate allegations from Deborah Ramirez, who told the New Yorker in an article published Sunday that she recalled Judge Kavanaugh exposing himself to her at a drunken party when they were both students at Yale University in the 1980s.Her allegations couldn't be independently verified by The Wall Street Journal. Ms. Ramirez's attorney declined to comment on Monday.While some people cited in the article backed up parts of Ms. Ramirez's account, others disputed it and Mr. Kavanaugh denied it. GOP lawmakers and aides said Monday that without stronger corroboration, Ms. Ramirez's account wouldn't derail Judge Kavanaugh, although a GOP aide said the Judiciary Committee reached out to Ms. Ramirez's attorney after the allegations surfaced and hadn't received a response.Democrats said the Federal Bureau of Investigation could provide answers that politicians could not in questioning witnesses at the Senate hearing. The White House and the GOP have opposed having the FBI look further into the allegations.""There is only one way to get to the bottom of these allegations against Judge Kavanaugh and prevent the nation from being thrown into further turmoil: an independent background check investigation by the FBI,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Monday.The typical FBI background check -- even for the most sensitive government positions -- doesn't take into account much information before a nominee was 18, aside from verifying basic biographical information such as birthplace and birth date, according to people familiar with the process.While the GOP rallied behind its president's nominee, Senate Republicans said it wasn't clear if there will be enough support to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, with undecided Republican senators -- including Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona -- waiting to assess his performance on Thursday. Republicans have a 51-49 Senate majority, so Judge Kavanaugh can afford no more than one defection, assuming all Democrats vote against him.Meanwhile, unease was growing over the effect the ugly, high-profile fight may have on November's elections. In their effort to retain control of the House after the midterms, Republicans have been specifically courting women, who hold less favorable views of Judge Kavanaugh than men, according to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.The new allegation from Ms. Ramirez surfaced just as lawyers for Dr. Ford, a 51-year-old psychology professor at Palo Alto University, reached an agreement with Judiciary Committee Republicans to appear at a hearing Thursday.Some details are still being negotiated, including the rounds of questions, after days of wrangling and partisan positioning, but it appeared set to happen as of Monday evening.Democrats plan to go beyond Dr. Ford's specific allegation to press Judge Kavanaugh, 53, on his teenage drinking habits."
wsj,Main Street: It's Susan Collins's Moment,"If Brett Kavanaugh were on trial for sexual assault, all he'd need do is demonstrate reasonable doubt about the charges being made against him. But a Republican nominee to the Supreme Court is tried in the media, where Mr. Kavanaugh must now do the impossible: prove an assault never happened.Christine Blasey Ford alleges that at a high-school party 36 years ago, 17-year-old Brett Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, tried to remove her clothes, and covered her mouth so she couldn't scream. Ms. Ford, now a professor at California's Palo Alto University, says she was able to flee the room only after a friend of Mr. Kavanaugh's, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them and they all tumbled off the bed. Ms. Ford further says she didn't tell anyone what happened at the time.Judge Kavanaugh's denial is categorical: ""I have never done anything like what the accuser describes -- to her or anyone,"" he said in a statement Monday. Mr. Judge likewise denies it all. ""It's just absolutely nuts,"" he told the Weekly Standard. ""I never saw Brett act that way.""The truth is, no one knows what went on in that Maryland bedroom at that party -- or if Mr. Kavanaugh was even there. Absent corroborating testimony, even the Federal Bureau of Investigation would have no way to reveal much more.So here we are, just days before what should have been a Thursday vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Since Ms. Ford's name became public, one member of that committee, Jeff Flake, the retiring Republican from Arizona, announced he wouldn't feel comfortable going ahead with a vote without a fuller airing of Ms. Ford's complaint. In a committee of 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats, Mr. Flake would give the Democrats the majority they need to stall a vote.Republicans Bob Corker, the retiring senator from Tennessee, and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski have also come out against holding a vote until Ms. Ford can be heard. They are joined by Democratic incumbents facing tight election races in states carried by Donald Trump: Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Joe Manchin (W.Va.). Though Democrats would love to kill the Kavanaugh nomination, the more practical aim is a lengthy delay that would spare these Democrats a tough vote before the November midterms.But there's another senator who may hold the key to whether the GOP hangs together or heads for the tall grass. On Sunday Maine Republican Susan Collins told the New York Times that she considers the allegations of sexual assault serious and wants Ms. Ford interviewed to get her whole story. Just as telling, she made clear she finds the low and the last-minute nature of the way the Democrats handled the charges fishy.""If they believed Professor Ford, why didn't they surface this information earlier so that he could be questioned about it?"" Ms. Collins said. ""And if they didn't believe her and chose to withhold the information, why did they decide at the 11th hour to release it? It is really not fair to either of them the way it was handled.""Ms. Collins's complaints about fairness aren't easily dismissed. She's a strong advocate for women's rights; she announced in 2016 she wouldn't vote for Donald Trump; and she hasn't been afraid to buck her party, as when she voted against ObamaCare repeal. She's also firmly pro-choice but recently stood up to a nasty crowdfunding effort to bribe her into voting against Judge Kavanaugh over claims he would overturn Roe v. Wade.In remarks to reporters Monday afternoon, Ms. Collins called for accuser and accused to testify before the Judiciary Committee under oath. Not long after that, the Judiciary Committee scheduled a one-day hearing Monday on the issue. Ms. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh will each be heard.This is a risky accommodation, because the media and Democrats won't be satisfied no matter what Republicans do. But if it provides the space GOP senators need to move ahead to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, it may be the least damaging accommodation. The test is whether the hearing serves the purpose of keeping confirmation process close to schedule, or whether it will be turn into what the Democrats are really pushing for: the first of many delaying actions to come -- what one Judiciary Committee staffer describes as ""Borking 2.0.""By all means let's hear what Ms. Ford has to say. But let us hope Ms. Collins insists it not be at the expense of fairness to Judge Kavanaugh. Because right now the effort to put off his confirmation votes seems aimed at establishing an odious, new post-hearing precedent, whereby a single, inconclusive and uncorroborated #MeToo accusation can upend all Senate norms and leave a man with an otherwise sterling reputation twisting in the wind."
wsj,Committee Vote Yields High Drama,"WASHINGTON -- After the raw and riveting hearing Thursday on sexual assault allegedly committed by a teenage Brett Kavanaugh, Friday's committee vote was expected to be an anticlimax, allowing senators to repeat calcified views before voting 11-10 along party lines to send President Trump's Supreme Court nominee to the Senate floor.Instead, the previous day's spectacle gave way to intrigue, as events in and around the Dirksen Senate Office Building's wood-paneled Room 226 turned an apparent fait accompli into a fast-moving drama centering on Sen. Jeff Flake, a retiring Republican from Arizona.Throughout the Dirksen building and the larger Capitol complex, anti-Kavanaugh protesters clogged corridors, staffers congregated around television monitors or stared at smartphones to follow the hearing, and senators sought to navigate -- physically as well as politically -- the perils posed by the nomination.Mr. Flake's frequent criticism of Mr. Trump and often-conciliatory stance toward the opposition made him the sole Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee who Democrats thought might tilt against Judge Kavanaugh, particularly after Thursday's testimony by Christine Blasey Ford, the California professor who said the assault had scarred her for life. Judge Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations.Four minutes before the committee's 9:30 a.m. meeting time, Mr. Flake appeared to eliminate any suspense with an emailed press release pledging to vote for Judge Kavanaugh.""I wish that I could express the confidence that some of my colleagues have conveyed about what either did or did not happen in the early 1980s, but I left the hearing yesterday with as much doubt as certainty,"" his statement said. And a tie goes to the accused, whose conservative legal views align with his, Mr. Flake reasoned.Bringing down the gavel, committee chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) sought to move quickly through procedures that could send Judge Kavanaugh's nomination to a floor vote.It turned out, however, that the real action had occurred in a building elevator, where two women confronted Mr. Flake minutes after he announced support for Judge Kavanaugh, telling him that they, too, had been sexually assaulted.""You're telling all women that they don't matter, that they should just stay quiet, because if they tell you what happened to them, you are going to ignore them,"" one said.Mr. Flake entered the hearing room, but word quickly spread about the dramatic encounter. When Mr. Flake, visibly pained, abruptly left the room, rumors spread that he was reconsidering his support for Judge Kavanaugh.The hearing's tenor changed shortly before 1 p.m., when Mr. Grassley declared the committee would stand ""at ease until the fall of the gavel."" Silence replaced rancor as senators began to disappear through the mirrored rear door leading to their anteroom, and it became clear that something was going on.The specified vote time of 1:30 p.m. came and went. Then, as abruptly as he had left, Mr. Flake returned. He had no deal to announce, just his own position: He would vote to recommend Judge Kavanaugh to the full Senate -- but wouldn't vote to confirm him on the floor without a weeklong delay to let the FBI investigate Dr. Ford's allegations.""This country is being ripped apart here,"" he said. His position, he said, was an effort to mend that tear."
wsj,A Stumble Down Memory Lane,"Christine Blasey Ford has told the world that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her 36 years ago, when they were 15 and 17, respectively. Because it was so long ago, she doesn't know where or when the alleged assault occurred. But she says she knows what Mr. Kavanaugh did to her, in graphic detail.The judge denies her accusations categorically. He attests that he has never treated any woman in the manner Ms. Ford says he treated her. All of Ms. Ford's three named witnesses don't recall any such party; one denies knowing Judge Kavanaugh.Now, one of Judge Kavanaugh's Yale classmates, Deborah Ramirez, has accused him of lewd conduct at a freshman-year dorm party. ""She was at first hesitant to speak publicly, partly because her memories contained gaps because she had been drinking,"" the magazine asserts. She ""felt confident"" of her story only ""after six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney."" Again, Judge Kavanaugh denies her allegations categorically.What to do? The common assumption in such he-said/she-said disputes is that we can assess the disputants' credibility and believability based on how they conduct themselves under questioning. Yet there are strong reasons to resist taking the bait on saying who is being truthful. In both these cases, as in many other public pronouncements of sexual misconduct, the scientific literature does not offer guidance on declaring who is misremembering -- or lying, which implies an intent to deceive.The literature instead strongly supports deferring to long-honored legal requirements for judging the truthfulness of accusers and defenders by assessing claims with verifiable evidence. Relying solely on accusations and denials is fraught with potential error.Memories are subject to serious flaws, given the limitations and imperfections of the biological and psychological processes of recording, retaining and recalling them. Memories aren't computer files with exacting recall and retrieval functions. They are often disassembled and stored in ""packets"" in multiple brain locations. People don't store the fine details of all daily experiences, because of neuron capacity limitations. Even important details can be missed or lost.Hence the brain must be selective in which memories it stores and must condense them so that many details are left out. Many eyewitnesses and even victims of crimes don't take note of the facial features of gun-toting assailants or the make and color of getaway cars.In retrieving memories, people reassemble them and -- as Ms. Ramirez did in consultation with her lawyer -- fill in the blanks in the condensed version. That process is fraught with the risk of error, especially when heavy drinking or drugs are involved. Crime victims who forget key facial features of their assailants can distort their recalled and reassembled memories so thoroughly that they accuse the wrong person of the actual crime. See the parade of longtime prisoners released because DNA tests prove them innocent.The more remote a memory is in time, the less reliable it tends to be, partly because of decay and partly because recalled memories can be corrupted by new information. New and old memories can be conflated, sometimes emerging as totally false memories. Memories can be warped by leading questions from therapists, lawyers, journalists or others.My colleague Elizabeth Loftus was able to ""implant"" false memories in a significant subset of laboratory subjects by showing them an official-looking poster of Disney characters, including Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny. Many subjects later remembered meeting Bugs Bunny on a childhood trip to Disneyland. Some of them even reported that Bugs had touched them inappropriately.That was impossible. Bugs Bunny isn't a Disney character.Along with the unreliability of memory, there is the difficulty of determining whether someone is lying. Evolutionary biologists claim that over the eons people have honed lying and cheating skills -- scholars call them ""tactical deception"" -- as survival and reproductive strategies. If given several costless or profitable chances to lie, many people will do so, with little hesitation and often convincingly. According to one study, some people can't go 10 minutes without lying. Lying on resumes, especially about educational credentials, is rampant, according to research.No doubt some people resist strong temptations to lie, but liars can be good at faking sincerity. Without additional evidence, it is very difficult to tell who's lying and who's telling the truth. Witnesses in courts and congressional hearings are threatened with potentially brutal cross-examinations and with up to five years in prison for perjury. You'd think that would be enough to stop anyone from lying under oath. Yet the number of perjury prosecutions in federal courts alone has ranged from 250 to 645 a year over the last decade.When the stakes are high, people simply can't be taken at their words alone -- and neither can they be called liars without evidence. That's especially the case when raw politics can infiltrate memories from long ago.Pundits have drawn a line between Judge Kavanaugh and his accusers, and insisted Americans take sides. But there is a third way: Remain agnostic until you know whether the accusations are backed by independent corroborating evidence. Without corroboration the public -- and members of congressional committees -- can't know whether a memory is authentic or is a product of some other process."
wsj,Upward Mobility: The Mitchell Memo's Devastating Conclusions,"Rachel Mitchell, the outside prosecutor hired by Senate Republicans, took some heat last week for the methodical manner in which she questioned Christine Blasey Ford, the college professor who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were in high school more than 35 years ago. Supporters of Judge Kavanaugh had expected Ms. Mitchell to be more combative, but she was more interested in being thorough. Now we know why.On Sunday Ms. Mitchell sent senators a nine-page memo outlining her assessment of Ms. Ford's testimony, and the portrait she paints of the accuser is devastating. Ms. Mitchell writes that Ms. Ford ""has not offered a consistent account of the alleged assault"" -- when it happened and what occurred -- and has even ""struggled to identify Judge Kavanaugh as the accuser by name.""""A 'he said, she said' case is incredibly difficult to prove,"" writes Ms. Mitchell. ""But this case is even weaker than that. Dr. Ford identified other witnesses to the event, and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them."" One of those supposed witnesses is Leland Keyser, a lifelong friend of Ms. Ford, whose attorney has stated: ""Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.""Sexual-assault victims, we are told, sometimes experience memory lapses, and given the amount of time that has passed since the alleged event occurred in the early 1980s, it's no surprise that Ms. Ford doesn't remember every detail. What's remarkable is how Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have attempted to turn her inconsistent statements and memory lapses into a virtue. By their logic, the hazier the recollection, the more credible the allegation.Ms. Mitchell, who has been prosecuting sex-related and other crimes for nearly a quarter-century, isn't buying it. Whether the witness looked or sounded like someone who believed what she was saying matters less than whether her account can be corroborated. Ms. Ford's memory loss seems rather selective and her inconsistencies have piled up -- not only over the past three decades but also over the past three months. In early July she told the Washington Post that the assault occurred in the ""mid-1980s."" Later that month, she told Sen. Dianne Feinstein that it occurred in the ""early 80s."" By September, Ms. Ford was convinced that she was attacked in the ""summer of 1982."" ""While it is common for victims to be uncertain about dates,"" writes Ms. Mitchell, ""Dr. Ford failed to explain how she was suddenly able to narrow the timeframe to a particular season and particular year.""Ms. Ford, who possesses two master's degrees and a doctorate, claims that she knew how to contact her congresswoman but not her senator. She says she struggled academically in college due to the assault, but makes no claim of struggling through her final two years of high school. Even her age at the time of the alleged incident has varied in her descriptions over the years. In 2013 she told a therapist it happened in her ""late teens."" Now she says it happened when she was 15. And so on.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that the Senate will start voting this week on the nomination, and let's hope he means it this time. Judge Kavanaugh has denied Ms. Ford's allegations, and the other women who have come forward have been even less credible. The only thing we seem to have established is that Judge Kavanaugh drank -- sometimes to excess, when he was young -- which he doesn't deny and which isn't evidence that he sexually assaulted Ms. Ford or anyone else.Assenting to the FBI investigation was a mistake. The Republicans know that it is a mostly redundant exercise intended to postpone a vote until after the midterm elections, not determine what did or didn't happen 36 years ago. Agents are re-interviewing people who were already contacted by Senate staffers. Judge Kavanaugh's six previous background checks over the past 25 years have turned up nothing, let alone something this serious. What would be fishy is if the seventh background check turned out any differently.Predictably, Democrats have used the delay to argue that a one-week investigation is insufficient and that the probe's scope is too limited. They've also decided, based on Judge Kavanaugh's response to some of the allegations, that he lacks the right ""temperament"" for a Supreme Court justice. The bigger concern for the country might be the temperament of Senate Democrats who are so willing and eager to dispense with due process in order to prevent President Trump from filling a Supreme Court vacancy."
wsj,Therapeutic Narratives Needn't Be Factual,"Christine Blasey Ford was believable and sincere when she told her story of being assaulted by a young Brett Kavanaugh. So was Judge Kavanaugh when he categorically denied her claims -- and none of her purported eyewitnesses have any memory of the gathering she describes. They can't both be telling the truth, but it is possible neither is deliberately lying.Consider that according to Ms. Ford, she first told the story during therapy. The therapist's role is different from that of a detective, journalist or lawyer. When a patient tells me a story, I don't test it to see if it's objectively accurate. I may help patients see things from a different perspective, but I never doubt the reality of what they are saying -- or, as Sen. Cory Booker put it, of ""her truth."" The therapist's job is to empathize with and believe those in pain.In many cases therapy leads patients to change the stories they tell themselves to heal their emotional wounds. A therapeutic narrative may be a mix of accurate and inaccurate memories, along with inferences to fill in the gaps. Like mythology or other literature, it can provide truthful insights into one's inner life even if it doesn't pass the test of objective accuracy.Complicating matters in this case is the undeveloped state of the adolescent brain. Between ages 9 and 25, the prefrontal cortex and limbic system undergo stages of flux and reorganization. These areas of the brain are responsible for memory, judgment, stress and emotional regulation, and connecting behaviors to consequences. Before the brain is fully mature, boys and girls alike are prone to impulsive, aggressive and selfish behavior. Teens commonly use the psychological defenses of denial and repression to protect themselves from painful memories or actions.Middle adolescence (14 to 17) is also a time of what mental-health professionals call present-oriented thinking. Teens at this stage have little connection to the past (experience) or the future (consequences). That contributes to later difficulty in recalling events and actions from those years of development.How we remember depends on many factors. Both traumatic and thrilling events can leave a lasting imprint. A very painful or embarrassing memory may be repressed, or an occasion of no consequence may be forgotten. Memories may change or become less clear over time. Often a person who feels victimized will remember an incident vividly, while the same event will leave no impression on the aggressor. Years after being bullied as a teenager, I approached one of my tormentors at a party in New York. When I reminded her how she treated me, she stared blankly and said she didn't know what I was talking about. I believed her -- and in that moment understood how powerful psychological defenses can be.It is difficult not to feel for both Ms. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. They each remember the past so differently, and each of their lives has been changed forever by what happened -- or didn't -- 36 years ago."
wsj,GOP Leaders Agree to Give FBI Latitude,"WASHINGTON -- Senior Republicans said they wouldn't restrict who the FBI could question as part of its investigation into sexual-assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, but said they planned to begin floor votes this week on his confirmation.President Trump said that he wanted a ""comprehensive"" inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, although he also made clear on Monday he desired quick action by the agency. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said the Senate would begin voting this week on Judge Kavanaugh, meaning not much time would elapse between the end of the FBI's investigation and such votes.Republicans fended off criticism that they were rushing through a cursory probe and took pains to say that while they had limited it to ""current and credible"" allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, they never told the FBI which individuals to question. The FBI has already begun talking to several witnesses connected to allegations from college professor Christine Blasey Ford, according to their attorneys.""We didn't give them any list,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R., Texas) said. ""The agreement was to [look into] current and credible allegations.""Mr. Trump said he is open to dropping his support for Judge Kavanaugh depending on the outcome of the FBI probe. ""I'm waiting, just like you,"" he said. ""Certainly if they find something I'm going to take that into consideration . . . . I have a very open mind.""While the FBI has spoken to several people, it hasn't talked to Dr. Ford, who first brought allegations of misconduct against Judge Kavanaugh.The FBI has talked to Mark Judge, who Dr. Ford said was present when she was sexually assaulted by Judge Kavanaugh at a house party when they were teenagers, according to a lawyer for Mr. Judge. The interview with Mr. Judge isn't complete, the lawyer said.Investigators have also spoken with Deborah Ramirez, who told the New Yorker that Judge Kavanaugh exposed himself to her while drunk when they were at Yale University, according to her attorney. Judge Kavanaugh has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct and characterized them as a political smear.An attorney for P.J. Smyth, whom Dr. Ford identified as also being at the gathering, said Monday his client had spoken to the FBI. Mr. Smyth repeated his earlier statement that he doesn't know anything about the allegations, attorney Eric Bruce said.The FBI declined to comment.Mr. Trump discussed on Monday an aspect of Judge Kavanaugh's comments before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that have drawn increasing amounts of attention -- his youthful drinking, specifically whether he was truthful in describing how much he drank. Taking questions after an event about a new trade deal, Mr. Trump heaped praise on Judge Kavanaugh, commending him for conceding that he at times drank too much. ""I was surprised at how vocal he was about the fact that he likes beer and he's had a little bit of difficulty.""Mr. Trump went on to say that he doesn't drink and ""can honestly say I've never had a beer in my life."" He added, ""Can you imagine, if I had, what a mess I'd be? I'd be the world's worst.""For the White House and Senate GOP leaders, the goal of the FBI investigation is to address the concerns of the critical group of undecided GOP senators who said they needed more information before they could support Judge Kavanaugh. Republican Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have all said the FBI should be free to follow the investigation where it goes this week.Mr. Flake said he was in discussions with Senate colleagues and the White House counsel's office about the investigation. ""We certainly want the FBI to do a real investigation and we are working to make sure that that happens,"" Mr. Flake told an audience in Boston.Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the specific allegation made by Dr. Ford. He has said that while he occasionally drank too many beers, he never blacked out from drinking. It wasn't clear Monday whether the FBI would speak to a third woman, Julie Swetnick, who said she attended parties in the early 1980s at which Judge Kavanaugh would ""spike"" the punch and ""target"" women, grabbing them without their consent. Judge Kavanaugh has denied Ms. Swetnick's claims.The debate over whether Judge Kavanaugh was truthful about his drinking habits in his testimony intensified Monday, as additional classmates said the nominee had drunk more than he claimed.On Sunday, Chad Ludington, a classmate of Judge Kavanaugh's at Yale, said in a statement to several news outlets that he had witnessed Judge Kavanaugh ""staggering from alcohol consumption"" and that he was ""often belligerent and aggressive"" when drunk, even starting a fight that ended with a mutual friend going to jail.The White House released statements from two other Yale classmates, who said they never saw Judge Kavanaugh black out from drinking or behave aggressively while drunk.One person close to Judge Kavanaugh said the judge is frustrated with the current situation but hopeful he will be clearly vindicated by the FBI probe. ""He's not happy about the process,"" this person said. ""But in a way, he's heartened by the fact that there will be a conclusion that will hopefully clear his name.""Late Monday, Harvard Law School told students that Judge Kavanaugh wouldn't be teaching there next semester, according to an email viewed by The Wall Street Journal. He had taught at Harvard Law since 2008.""Today, Judge Kavanaugh indicated that he can no longer commit to teaching his course in January Term 2019,"" Catherine Claypoole, the school's dean for academic and faculty affairs, wrote in the email.While Mr. Flake and the other undecided GOP senators have said they won't vote for Judge Kavanaugh until the FBI has completed its report, Mr. McConnell could still take a procedural step this week to pave the way for a quicker Senate vote once the bureau is done with its work."
wsj,"From GOP Surrogate, A Careful Inquiry","The Arizona prosecutor tapped by Senate Republicans to question Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's accuser struck a measured and at times gentle tone Thursday with Christine Blasey Ford, while testing her memory and motives.Rachel Mitchell was chosen to serve as a surrogate questioner for Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee. At least until late afternoon, when GOP senators began to pose questions themselves when Judge Kavanaugh was before the committee, Ms. Mitchell largely set the tenor for the hearing's first half.Her carefully worded questions attempted to avoid the impression of a hostile interrogation while teasing out the reasons behind Dr. Ford's decision to go public with her accusation that Judge Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her at a high-school party in the early 1980s.Ms. Mitchell was careful to avoid implying that Dr. Ford was lying about her allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. But she tried to draw attention to the holes in Dr. Ford's memory, including varying recollections Dr. Ford has given about the year of the alleged attack.Later, Ms. Mitchell focused on the circumstances leading up to Thursday's hearing and Dr. Ford's decision to come forward, inquiring whether she was influenced by political forces.She was most pointed about why Dr. Ford hadn't turned to a forensic interviewer more experienced helping sexual-abuse victims get to the truth of their memory and trauma. ""Instead, you were advised to get an attorney and take a polygraph? Is that right?"" she said. ""And instead of submitting to an interview in California, we're having a hearing here today in five-minute increments, is that right?""Ms. Mitchell's questioning turned more direct and graphic when it was Judge Kavanaugh's turn to speak.She recounted Dr. Ford's allegations and posed to him a list of yes-or-no questions, getting back denials for each of them.""Have you ever ground or rubbed your genitals against Dr. Ford?"" she asked. ""No,"" said the judge."
wsj,Lindsey Graham Says Stop,"The U.S. Senate is sometimes called ""the Club."" No Member in our time more personifies the Club than South Carolina's Lindsey Graham. On Thursday at the Kavanaugh hearing, he dropped out.When his turn arrived to question Brett Kavanaugh, Senator Graham instead stared across the long table at the Judiciary Committee's Democrats and, well, unloaded. He called their tactics against Judge Kavanaugh ""the most unethical sham since I've been in politics."" A moment's pause and then this: ""Boy, do you want power, and I hope you never get it.""What caused Lindsey Graham to pop?A phrase rolling through the Kavanaugh confirmation story the past few weeks is character assassination. It is an ugly thing, and most of the time American politics stops short of defeating an opponent solely by tearing him apart personally and then using the damage to his reputation as a pretext to defeat him.By the midday recess of Thursday's hearing, that manifestly was the Democrats' strategy. The hearing made clear that Christine Blasey Ford's accusation was not going to be corroborated. But the Democrats' real interest wasn't Ms. Ford. It was Judge Kavanaugh. The informal standards of the Senate Club were shattered Thursday by Senators Dianne Feinstein, Richard Blumenthal, Mazie Hirono, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris.One Democratic Senator after another took the allotted time to say Ms. Ford had been the victim of a sexual predator, specifically Judge Kavanaugh. None bothered to say the acts were ""alleged.""Do not forget the point of all this. It has been clear from day one that every committee Democrat would vote against Judge Kavanaugh. Their strategy has been to turn three Republican Senators against Mr. Kavanaugh to defeat his nomination and make that defeat a strategy for winning back Senate control in November.By late afternoon, Senator Graham had enough. ""To my Republican colleagues,"" he said, ""if you vote no, you are legitimizing the most despicable thing that I have seen in my time in politics."" It's no secret that America's polarized politics is running off the rails. Lindsey Graham's finest moment may be that he threw the brake."
wsj,Judge's Accuser Is In Talks to Testify,"WASHINGTON -- The California professor who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers would be willing to testify next week before a Senate panel, her lawyer said.The offer to appear before the Judiciary Committee could break a partisan logjam over whether the FBI should investigate her allegations.Christine Blasey Ford isn't willing, however, to go before the panel on Monday, when a hearing is scheduled, her lawyer wrote in an email Thursday to committee staff members. ""She wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety,"" wrote the lawyer, Debra Katz, who added that Dr. Ford had been receiving death threats.Before Thursday, Dr. Ford had said she wanted the Federal Bureau of Investigation to reopen a background investigation into Judge Kavanaugh before she testified, an idea rejected by Republicans. In Thursday's message, Ms. Katz said that continues to be Dr. Ford's ""strong preference,"" but it doesn't appear to be an unconditional demand.Ms. Katz spoke with Senate Judiciary Committee staff Thursday, but the two sides didn't reach an agreement, congressional aides said. Ms. Katz raised logistical questions about security and what media would be present. They also discussed other sticking points such as additional witnesses. Dr. Ford has asked for Judge Kavanaugh to testify first. Her camp is also pushing to hold the hearing on Thursday, according to congressional aides.The conversations are expected to continue, the aides said. Ms. Katz canceled two planned television appearances Thursday night, citing the effort to make progress with the committee.A spokesman for committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) issued a statement later saying Mr. Grassley would confer with other senators about the hearing. ""He remains committed to providing a fair forum for both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh,"" the statement said.The Palo Alto University psychology professor has alleged that at a high-school party in the 1980s, Judge Kavanaugh groped her and tried to remove her clothes after he and a friend pulled her into a room. Judge Kavanaugh has denied the allegation.Sen. Grassley had scheduled a hearing Monday and invited both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh to testify. Late Thursday, Judge Kavanaugh sent a letter to Mr. Grassley formally accepting an invitation to appear at the hearing.""From the moment I first heard this allegation, I have categorically and unequivocally denied it,"" Judge Kavanaugh wrote in the letter.President Trump on Thursday said in an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News that he didn't believe the confirmation proceedings should be delayed any longer. But he added, ""Let her have her say and let's see how it all works out.""Democrats said an FBI investigation was needed to provide a neutral set of facts and that additional witnesses should testify. GOP lawmakers said that was unnecessary, noting that the FBI had already investigated at length.Meanwhile, Democrats continued on Thursday to cite Dr. Ford's request for an FBI investigation as an indication she was confident the facts would support her assertions.""Who is not asking the FBI to investigate these claims? The White House,"" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.). ""Judge Kavanaugh has not asked to have the FBI to review these claims. Is that the reaction of an innocent person? It is not.""The FBI could reopen its background investigation of Judge Kavanaugh, but it would be up to President Trump, a Republican, to direct them to do so. He has dismissed the idea, saying it is unnecessary given that the judge has undergone previous background checks.Ms. Gillibrand and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D., Hawaii) said they had received a letter Thursday from more than 1,000 alumnae of Holton-Arms School, from which Dr. Ford graduated in 1984, supporting Dr. Ford.A public appearance by Dr. Ford could change the political calculus for both parties. Aides and strategists from both parties believe her absence would make it easier for Judge Kavanaugh to get confirmed.Several Republicans have urged her to appear. Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine), considered a pivotal vote, said earlier this week it would be unfair of Dr. Ford to make these accusations without answering questions under oath.""There are these very serious allegations hanging over the head of a nominee who has emphatically denied them,"" Ms. Collins told a Maine radio show Wednesday.In her email Thursday, Ms. Katz wrote that Dr. Ford and her family have relocated from their northern California home amid the death threats and online intimidation.Judge Kavanaugh's wife, Ashley Estes Kavanaugh, also has faced threats, which are being investigated by the U.S. Marshals Service, a senior administration official said Thursday.She has received two profane notes on her work email account in recent days, the official said. Both notes, which have been reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, were sent from the same email address. One of the notes to Mrs. Kavanaugh, a town manager in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., reads, ""May you, your husband and your kids burn in hell."" The other, whose subject line reads, ""Hi, Ashley,"" says she should tell her husband to ""put a bullet in his . . . skull.""One person close to the confirmation process said that while Mrs. Kavanaugh is upset by the attacks on her husband, she doesn't want him to withdraw. Judge Kavanaugh himself hasn't considered withdrawing, according a person familiar with his thinking.""He's absolutely intending to go forward,"" this person said, and is determined ""to reiterate his strong and categorical denial, to clear his reputation and move forward in the process.""Republicans have an advantage of 11-10 on the Judiciary Committee and 51-49 in the full Senate, meaning they cannot afford to lose more than one vote, assuming all Democrats vote against Judge Kavanaugh. In case of a tie, Vice President Mike Pence could cast a vote to confirm him."
wsj,The Presumption of Guilt,"""As Judge Kavanaugh stands to gain the lifetime privilege of serving on the country's highest court, he has the burden of persuasion. And that is only fair.""-- Anita Hill, Sept. 18, 2018""Not only do women like Dr. Ford, who bravely comes forward, need to be heard, but they need to be believed.""-- Sen. Maize Hirono (D., Hawaii)The last-minute accusation of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is an ugly spectacle by any measure. But if there is a silver lining, it is that the episode is providing an education for Americans on the new liberal standard of legal and political due process.As Ms. Hill and Sen. Hirono aver, the Democratic standard for sexual-assault allegations is that they should be accepted as true merely for having been made. The accuser is assumed to be telling the truth because the accuser is a woman. The burden is on Mr. Kavanaugh to prove his innocence. If he cannot do so, then he is unfit to serve on the Court.---This turns American justice and due process upside down. The core tenet of Anglo-American law is that the burden of proof always rests with the person making the accusation. An accuser can't doom someone's freedom or career merely by making a charge.The accuser has to prove the allegation in a court of law or in some other venue where the accused can challenge the facts. Otherwise we have a Jacobin system of justice in which ""J'accuse"" becomes the standard and anyone can be ruined on a whim or a vendetta.Another core tenet of due process is that an accusation isn't any more or less credible because of the gender, race, religion or ethnicity of who makes it. A woman can lie, as the Duke lacrosse players will tell you. Ms. Hirono's standard of credibility by gender would have appalled the civil-rights campaigners of a half century ago who marched in part against Southern courts that treated the testimony of black Americans as inherently less credible than that of whites. Yet now the liberal heirs of those marchers want to impose a double standard of credibility by gender.A third tenet of due process is the right to cross-examine an accuser. The point is to test an accuser's facts and credibility, which is why we have an adversarial system. The denial of cross-examination is a major reason that campus panels adjudicating sexual-assault claims have become kangaroo courts.It's worth quoting from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling this month in Doe v. Baum on a sexual-assault case at the University of Michigan.""Due process requires cross-examination in circumstances like these because it is 'the greatest legal engine ever invented' for uncovering the truth,"" wrote Judge Amul Thapar. ""Not only does cross-examination allow the accused to identify inconsistencies in the other side's story, but it also gives the fact-finder an opportunity to assess a witness's demeanor and determine who can be trusted. So if a university is faced with competing narratives about potential misconduct, the administration must facilitate some form of cross-examination in order to satisfy due process.""---Consider the limited facts of Christine Blasey Ford's accusation against Judge Kavanaugh. It concerns an event some 36 years ago that she recalls in only partial detail. She remembers the alleged assault and rooms she entered with some specificity, but not the home where it occurred. She doesn't know how she traveled to or from the home that evening.She told no one about the incident for 30 years until a couples therapy session with her husband. Her therapist's notes say there were four assailants but she says there were only two. Two of the three other people she says were at the drinking party that night say they know nothing about the party or the assault, and Mr. Kavanaugh denies it categorically.Democrats claim that even asking questions about these facts is somehow an unfair attack on her as a woman. Her lawyer is demanding that Ms. Ford testify after Mr. Kavanaugh, and that only Senators ask questions -- no doubt to bar Republicans from having a female special counsel ask those questions.We're told Ms. Ford even wants to bar any questions about why she waited so long to recall the alleged assault and who she consulted in finally going public this year. Such a process is designed to obscure the truth, not to discover it. None of these demands should be tolerable to Senators who care about finding the truth about a serious accusation.We don't doubt that Ms. Ford believes what she claims. But the set of facts she currently provides wouldn't pass even the ""preponderance of evidence"" -- or 50.01% evidence of guilt -- test that prevails today on college campuses. If this is the extent of her evidence and it is allowed to defeat a Supreme Court nominee, a charge of sexual assault will become a killer political weapon regardless of facts. And the new American standard of due process will be the presumption of guilt."
wsj,"Accuser Seen as Thorough, Guarded","Christine Blasey Ford sent an unusual Facebook message to her best college friend this summer with a question: Had she ever mentioned a sexual assault that occurred when she was in high school?Her friend, Catherine Piwowarski, her onetime roommate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said she had no memory of that. She didn't know at the time that Dr. Ford was considering coming forward with her allegation that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in the 1980s, when both were teenagers in suburban Maryland.Interviews with friends and acquaintances of Dr. Ford paint a picture of a guarded person, one more interested in discussions of sports and science than politics and personal trauma. Her decision to go public this week with the explosive accusation has thrust her into an uncomfortable spotlight and put her three-decade-old memories at the center of a fight over the fate of President Trump's second Supreme Court nominee.Democrats have pointed to her allegation as a reason to disqualify Judge Kavanaugh. Republicans, without dismissing her claim, have questioned why her allegation wasn't aired sooner, before hearings were held earlier this month. They also say that her recollections are spotty and imprecise but potentially tarnishing to a nominee they see as extremely qualified for the court.In recent days, Dr. Ford has faced online intimidation and death threats, and her family relocated from their Northern California home, her lawyers said. This harassment, her lawyers said late Tuesday, has made her reluctant to testify Monday about details of a night she has rarely discussed and has said she struggles to remember. While she had initially agreed to testify, her lawyers said she would do so only after an FBI investigation into her allegation, which Republicans have rebuffed, saying nothing new would be learned.Dr. Ford didn't return calls for comment or answer the door this week at her home in Palo Alto, Calif., where she lives with her husband and two sons. Her lawyer Debra Katz also didn't respond to requests for more information.Dr. Ford, a 51-year-old research psychologist, said in a Washington Post article that she and Judge Kavanaugh were teenagers at a party in the early 1980s when he and a friend, whom she identified as Mark Judge, pulled her into a bedroom. Judge Kavanaugh pinned her down on the bed, groped her and tried to take off her clothes before she escaped, she said. Dr. Ford told the Post she didn't tell anyone about the alleged incident in detail until a couples therapy session with her husband in 2012.Judge Kavanaugh, 53, unequivocally denied the allegation, saying he didn't know who had made the claim until Dr. Ford identified herself in the story on Sunday.""I have never done anything like what the accuser describes -- to her or to anyone,"" he said.Mr. Judge has told lawmakers he has no memory of the alleged incident.Dr. Ford's friends describe her as credible and trustworthy; Judge Kavanaugh's have defended him as respectful and honorable.Dr. Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University in California, graduated from the all-girls Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Md., not far from the Georgetown Preparatory School Judge Kavanaugh attended.High-school classmates recalled her as a kind and popular cheerleader who played soccer and was on the diving team.""She was one of the nicest ones,"" said Eliza Knable, who was in the same high-school class but not part of the same friend group as Dr. Ford.Many Holton-Arms students socialized with or dated boys from nearby prep schools, including Judge Kavanaugh's, said Samantha Semerad Guerry. She was among a group of Holton alumnae from the class of 1984 who signed a letter to lawmakers in support of Dr. Ford.""One friend said, 'If she can't prove it, she doesn't put pen to paper,' "" Ms. Guerry said of Dr. Ford's allegation. ""She's not an overly sentimental person. She brought logistical reasoning.""Judge Kavanaugh's friends are similarly convinced he is an honorable man incapable of the offenses Dr. Ford described.""In every situation where we were together he was always respectful, kind and thoughtful,"" Maura Kane, who dated him in high school, said in a statement. ""The accusations leveled against him in no way represent the decent young man I knew.""None of Dr. Ford's high school or college friends interviewed for this article remembered her talking about the alleged incident at the party. Betsy Kingsley, a high-school friend, said she recalled a different gathering that both Dr. Ford and Mr. Judge attended during her sophomore year of high school.Friends said it was clear Dr. Ford remained traumatized decades later. Jim Gensheimer, a friend in Palo Alto, said she confided in him that she needed more than one exit door in her bedroom to prevent her from feeling trapped."
wsj,The Politics of Destruction,"Say this for Deborah Ramirez. The second woman to accuse Brett Kavanaugh of committing sexual assault more than 30 years ago may not clearly recall what happened, but her story does clarify the ugly politics at play. Democrats are using the #MeToo movement as a weapon of political destruction to defeat a Supreme Court nominee and retake Congress.Ms. Ramirez's story, as recounted by Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow in the New Yorker on Sunday, has more holes than even initial accuser Christine Blasey Ford's. Unlike Ms. Ford, she does recall the place and year -- a hall at Yale in their freshman year. Ms. Ramirez says that at a party Mr. Kavanaugh exposed himself and pushed his privates into her face, amid laughter from other men in the room, until she pushed him away.Mr. Kavanaugh says the event ""did not happen"" and is ""a smear, plain and simple.""---Even the sympathetic New Yorker writers concede that Ms. Ramirez was at first reluctant to talk about the incident. But after six days of ""assessing her memories,"" and after consulting with a Democratic lawyer, she felt confident enough to speak up. Even so, Ms. Ramirez concedes that she was drunk at the time to the point of being ""on the floor, foggy and slurring her words.""The reporters could not find a single other eyewitness who put Mr. Kavanaugh at the party. One of Ms. Ramirez's confirming witnesses is an unidentified man who says he heard about it from someone else. Another classmate, Richard Oh, says he overheard a female student whose identity he can't recall telling another student about such an incident at the time but with no reference to Mr. Kavanaugh.But two of the men Ms. Ramirez says were directly involved in the incident say they know nothing about it. Others who were close friends of Ms. Ramirez and Mr. Kavanaugh at Yale also say they never heard of it. This includes Ms. Ramirez's closest friend at the time who told the magazine that ""this is a woman I was best friends with. We shared intimate details of our lives. And I was never told this story by her, or by anyone else. It never came up. I didn't see it; I never heard of it happening.""Meanwhile, the New York Times reported Monday that it ""had interviewed several dozen people over the past week in an attempt to corroborate"" Ms. Ramirez's story, ""and could find no one with firsthand knowledge. Ms. Ramirez herself contacted former Yale classmates asking if they recalled the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr. Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself.""All of which adds up to another dimly recalled incident from 35 years ago, when Mr. Kavanaugh may or may not have been present, which alleged eyewitnesses deny attending, and about which the corroboration is second hand and unspecific. Mr. Farrow had sturdier journalistic standards before he teamed up with Ms. Mayer, who has devoted much of her professional life to tormenting Justice Clarence Thomas.Oh, and by the way, Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stormy Daniels, claims he has another ""credible"" accuser that he will unveil to the public. That cable TV appearance should certainly rate.---There is a phrase for what is happening here: character assassination. Judge Kavanaugh's good name is being smeared with sexual allegations on the eve of a Supreme Court confirmation vote in a campaign abetted if not orchestrated by Democrats.Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, withheld Ms. Ford's letter from her colleagues for six weeks until she sprung it at the last minute. She has since been demanding a fair and public hearing for Ms. Ford. But on Sunday she leapt on Ms. Ramirez's claim to demand an ""immediate postponement"" in the hearing now scheduled for Thursday.Fair? What about fairness for Mr. Kavanaugh, who since Ms. Ford's accusation has offered to testify under oath that none of this happened? Instead he has had to hear himself denounced day after day as a sexual predator as Democrats and Ms. Ford's lawyers try to dictate how a Senate committee should conduct its fact-finding.The obvious strategy is to delay the hearing, and Mr. Kavanaugh's chance to be heard and get a vote, for as long as possible. Who knows which other long-ago classmates might next rummage through their memories to recall what Mr. Kavanaugh might have done that no one else can remember?The latest Democratic demand is that Chairman Chuck Grassley call as a witness Mark Judge, who Ms. Ford claims was present when Mr. Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her. Mr. Judge has already told congressional staff -- lying to staff is a crime -- that he knows nothing about the episode. But Democrats want Mr. Judge on the public stage so they can use his admitted history of drinking to smear Mr. Kavanaugh by association.Judge Kavanaugh said firmly on Monday in a letter to Senators Grassley and Feinstein that ""I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. The coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out."" Good for him, and credit as well to President Trump for standing by him and (mostly) restraining his rhetoric.We warned Republicans not to fall for this politics of uncorroborated accusation, and perhaps now they understand that they are being played. Women who are abused deserve to be heard, but turning #MeToo into a political weapon undermines that cause.Once Ms. Ford and Mr. Kavanaugh are heard on Thursday, there should be no more delay. Call the roll and vote."
wsj,Judge's Accuser Roils Hearing Plan,"WASHINGTON -- Attorneys for the woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault said she wants a full investigation of the allegations before she testifies on Capitol Hill, throwing into doubt a planned Monday hearing that would have pitted her word against that of the Supreme Court nominee.In a letter Tuesday to Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, attorneys for California college professor Christine Blasey Ford asked for ""a full investigation by law enforcement officials"" to ""ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner."" But Mr. Grassley (R., Iowa) said Tuesday night that he wasn't prepared to wait for an FBI investigation.On Sunday, Dr. Ford made public her accusations from when she and Judge Kavanaugh were teenagers at a high-school party. Dr. Ford, now 51 years old, alleged that Judge Kavanaugh, 53, and one of his friends had pulled her into a bedroom, where she said Judge Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her and attempted to remove her clothing before she escaped. Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegations, saying no such incident occurred.After the allegations, Republicans had scheduled a hearing for next Monday to hear from both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh.Republicans have criticized the late hour in which the allegations came forward and defended Judge Kavanaugh while working to avoid alienating female voters before the midterm election in November. Polls suggest many women voters have been energized by opposition to the Trump presidency and by the #MeToo movement.While Dr. Ford's camp had previously indicated she would be willing to testify, her lawyers said Tuesday they feared she would be questioned by senators ""who appear to have made up their minds that she is 'mistaken' and 'mixed up.'"" They said she had faced threats to herself and her family.""She has been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats,"" the lawyers wrote, noting she had been forced to move out of her home.An investigation would ensure the Judiciary Committee ""is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions,"" attorneys for Dr. Ford wrote in the letter.Mr. Grassley indicated the committee wasn't willing to wait for a full FBI investigation of Dr. Ford's allegations.""Dr. Ford's testimony would reflect her personal knowledge and memory of events. Nothing the FBI or any other investigator does would have any bearing on what Dr. Ford tells the committee, so there is no reason for any further delay,"" Mr. Grassley said Tuesday night.Dr. Ford's attorneys said she remained open to ""reasonable steps"" on cooperating with the committee, but her stance left uncertain whether Judge Kavanaugh would still testify as planned on Monday, and whether the Judiciary Committee would hold a vote on his confirmation without hearing from Dr. Ford.GOP lawmakers had said they viewed Monday's hearing as her opportunity to present her story and also offered to conduct a private hearing.Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), who pushed for a delay for Dr. Ford to testify, said late Tuesday that the judiciary panel had taken steps to ensure Dr. Ford could be heard and the Senate should move forward.""Republicans extended a hand in good faith. If we don't hear from both sides on Monday, let's vote,"" he tweeted late Tuesday.Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Republican on the Judiciary Committee, tweeted after the letter became public that ""we should proceed as planned"" with confirming Judge Kavanaugh.The White House was surprised by Dr. Ford's request for a full investigation, an official said Tuesday night.At minimum, the request means the hearing set for Monday ""is not going to look the way it was designed to look initially,"" the official said. With Dr. Ford now seeking an investigation before any testimony, she is ""kind of walking back on"" the initial stance that she wanted to testify before the committee and tell senators her allegations directly, the White House official said.President Trump tweeted about the Supreme Court late Tuesday without referring to Judge Kavanaugh or Dr. Ford.""The Supreme Court is one of the main reasons I got elected President,"" Mr. Trump tweeted. ""I hope Republican Voters, and others, are watching, and studying, the Democrats Playbook.""GOP leaders had earlier Tuesday dismissed the idea of launching an FBI investigation into the new allegations, saying Judge Kavanaugh had already been thoroughly vetted.""There have been multiple investigations. Judge Kavanaugh has been through six FBI investigations in the course of his lengthy public career,"" Senate Majority Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said. Mr. McConnell said the new allegations would be addressed if both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh testified next week.The FBI conducts background checks of nominees. A spokesman for the Justice Department said it ""does not make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation"" and instead provides information to senators.Democrats, for their part, also had pushed back against the scheduled Monday hearing, saying that timetable was rushed. They also pressed for an FBI investigation, and for more witnesses to be heard, including the friend of Judge Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, who Dr. Ford alleged was in the room at the time. Republicans have resisted his inclusion. Mr. Judge's lawyer said Tuesday he didn't want to testify before the committee.Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, who notified the FBI of the allegations last week, said a full investigation should be conducted.""We should honor Dr. Blasey Ford's wishes and delay this hearing,"" Mrs. Feinstein said Tuesday night. ""A proper investigation must be completed, witnesses interviewed, evidence reviewed and all sides spoken to. Only then should the chairman set a hearing.""After aides briefed Mr. Trump on Monday, he signed onto an approach of letting Judge Kavanaugh take the lead in denying the accusation, a White House official said. Mr. Trump has uncharacteristically held his fire in denouncing Dr. Ford, although on Tuesday he cast his sympathy toward his high-court nominee.""I feel so badly for him,"" the president said of Judge Kavanaugh at a White House appearance. ""This is not a man who deserves this."""
wsj,A Spectral Witness Materializes,"The Salem witch trials turned on what was called ""spectral evidence."" That was testimony from witnesses -- either malicious or hysterical -- who claimed the accused had assumed the form of a black cat or some other devilish creature and had come visiting in the night in order to torment the witness with bites and scratches, or to rearrange the bedroom furniture, or to send the baby into paroxysms.Susannah Sheldon, aged about 18, testified that the defendant Sarah Good's apparition -- not the actual Sarah Good, but her spirit, her specter -- ""most violently pulled down my head behind a chest and tied my hands together with a whale band and almost choked me to death."" Other witnesses blamed Good for the mysterious deaths of cows or for causing a broom to fly up into an apple tree.The judge, William Stoughton, admitted this nonsense into evidence. Hysterical fantasies had real consequences: Sarah Good and four other defendants were hanged on July 19, 1692.Three hundred twenty-six years later, an anonymous woman -- a spectral and possibly nonexistent woman, for all that one knew when the story emerged -- accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her 36 years ago, when he was a high-school student. It seemed as if the American constitutional process might be drawn back to the neighborhood of Salem, Mass. According to this phantom testimony, 17-year-old Brett held the girl down, pawed her and tried to force himself upon her, and held his hand over her mouth when she screamed, until a second prep-school devil piled on top, they all tumbled to the floor, and the girl managed to slip away. The boys were ""stumbling drunk,"" according to the account.You were supposed to feel the sudden wind-shear of hypocrisy. The nominee was a seeming paragon -- perfect father and husband and coach of his daughters' basketball teams. He is a Roman Catholic with an Irish name, but now the script became as gleefully Calvinist as a Hawthorne tale. What imp of hell had possessed the Kavanaugh boy? The Protestant tale seemed to obtain subliminal verification against the background of Catholic sex-abuse scandals.Thus the constitutional process takes on an aspect of the 21st-century medieval. The accuser's story first emerged in a letter that came into the hands of California Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Ms. Feinstein brought it to light only after the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing, which featured somewhat Salem-like drama -- costumed apparitions from ""The Handmaid's Tale"" arranging themselves outside the committee room; inarticulate background screams of people being led away for disrupting the proceedings. It seemed as if Ms. Feinstein, not liking the odds of defeating Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation, had found a devilishly clever way to head it off after all.But then the accuser materialized, in the form of a 51-year-old California professor of clinical psychology, Christine Blasey Ford.What to make of it now? The tale became a lot less spectral. Still, there had been no police report, and there were no witnesses. The second boy allegedly in the room said he had no memory of such an incident and called the accusation ""absolutely nuts."" Judge Kavanaugh flatly denied it. Her therapist's notes from 30 years later are not objective reporting, merely a transcription of what Ms. Ford herself said.The thing happened -- if it happened -- an awfully long time ago, back in Ronald Reagan's time, when the actors in the drama were minors and (the boys, anyway) under the blurring influence of alcohol and adolescent hormones. No clothes were removed, and no sexual penetration occurred. The sin, if there was one, was not one of those that Catholic theology calls peccata clamantia -- sins that cry to heaven for vengeance.The offense alleged is not nothing, by any means. It is ugly, and stupid more than evil, one might think, but trauma is subjective and hard to parse legally. Common sense is a little hard put to know what to make of the episode, if it happened. The dust of 36 years has settled over the memory. The passage of time sometimes causes people to forget; sometimes it causes them to invent or embellish. Invention takes on bright energies when its muse is politics, which is the Olympics of illusion. Inevitably, people will sort the matter out along mostly partisan lines. A lot will depend upon the testimony of Ms. Ford, who has volunteered to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee. If the left expects a windfall from all this in November, it may find itself instead the victim of a terrific backlash.These are part of the 21st century's strange sectarian struggles. In another Senate hearing a year ago, Ms. Feinstein addressed Amy Coney Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor, about her nomination to the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Ms. Feinstein began fretting earnestly about the nominee's Catholicism. ""The dogma lives loud within you,"" the senator told the professor -- an oddly mystical locution.But 21st-century progressivism is also a religion -- a militant faith, a true church in nearly all important respects. It is a community of belief and shared values, with dogmas, heresies, sacraments and fanatics; with saints it reveres and devils it abhors, starting with the great Satan Donald Trump. If religion were to disqualify a Catholic from public service, it would logically have to disqualify a practicing progressive, who is the creature of a belief system that is, on the whole, considerably more dogmatic than the one with headquarters in Rome."
wsj,Friends In Focus For FBI Probe,"WASHINGTON -- The FBI investigation into the sexual-assault allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh could revolve around a calendar entry he wrote decades ago, and a small group of people at a house party where Christine Blasey Ford says she was attacked.The sudden turn of events Friday intensified the spotlight on Mark Judge, a Georgetown Preparatory School classmate of Judge Kavanaugh's who Dr. Ford says was in the room at the time of the alleged attack in the early 1980s outside Washington.Dr. Ford said that when Judge Kavanaugh had her pinned down, a laughing Mr. Judge jumped on top of them, allowing her to escape. But Mr. Judge has said in a letter submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee he has ""no memory of this alleged incident."" His lawyer, Barbara Van Gelder, said Friday that he ""will answer any and all questions posed to him by the FBI or any law enforcement agency.""Mr. Judge, 54 years old, has chronicled his hard-partying ways, and once wrote of a character, ""Bart O'Kavanaugh,"" who was so drunk he threw up in a car and ""passed out on his way back from a party.""Judge Kavanaugh on Thursday dismissed his friend's writing as fictionalized and while describing him as funny, gifted and popular, he noted Mr. Judge ""developed a serious addiction problem that lasted decades.""Social calendars kept by Judge Kavanaugh during high school indicate he and Mr. Judge were close. ""Go to Timmy's for Skis w/ Judge, Tom, PJ, Bernie, Squi,"" read an entry from July 1, 1982.""Skis"" is a reference to brewskis, or beer, based on Judge Kavanaugh's exchange with Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday.Judge Kavanaugh had initially said it was rare for him to drink on weekdays, but he allowed that the calendar entry indicated that in fact, he did at times drink on weekdays.Democrats seized on that date. ""This may, may be powerful corroborating evidence that the assault happened,"" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.) on Friday morning. ""That it happened that day. And that it happened in that place. But with no FBI investigation, we can't tell.""Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa contested that assertion. ""That's the wrong gathering,"" he said, saying the number of people listed on the calendar for that party differed from Dr. Ford's account of the party where she said she was assaulted.In addition, the entry mentions that the party was held at the home of ""Timmy,"" whom Judge Kavanaugh identified as Georgetown Prep classmate Tim Gaudette, who has signed letters defending his friend against accusations. The word ""squi"" on the calendar was a reference to another classmate, Chris Garrett, the judge said.A Christopher Garrett was one of a group of Georgetown Prep almuni who signed a letter supporting Judge Kavanaugh. Mr. Garrett hasn't commented further.Dr. Ford said she doesn't remember the precise location of the home where the attack happened, but her memory of the interior could provide more clues. In Senate testimony, she described remembering in detail the stairwell, the living room, the bedroom, and the bed to the right of the room's entrance.Dr. Ford has identified a couple of other people at the party, and they could be contacted by the FBI."
wsj,Lawyer Has Handled Many Abuse Cases,"Rachel Mitchell, the lawyer Republicans hired to question Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and a woman accusing him of sexual assault, has served as an Arizona sex-crimes prosecutor for more than two decades and built her career by investigating clergy abuse.Ms. Mitchell, a prosecutor since 1993, is on leave from her position as deputy county attorney and division chief of the Special Victims Division in the Maricopa County Attorney's Office in Phoenix, said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa).Ms. Mitchell, 50 years old, didn't respond to a request to comment.On Thursday, she is to question Judge Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a California college professor who has accused the judge of attempting to rape her when they were teenagers. Judge Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.Those who have known Ms. Mitchell describe her as caring, competent and fair. A Republican, she isn't known for being visibly political, say people who know her professionally.""You're not going to have a Perry Mason moment,"" said Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery, referring to the fictional attorney. ""Rachel is not going to pound away on people trying to break them down.""Ms. Mitchell's most extensive experience is dealing with clergy abuse. She has toured the country giving talks to evangelistic congregations about how to guard against sexual predators.""I care about these cases and I care about how they impact people within the church because I'm also a Christian and I am a Southern Baptist,"" Ms. Mitchell said in a video of a presentation about sex-abuse cases within the church."
wsj,Woman Is Hired To Do Questioning,"WASHINGTON -- Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have hired Rachel Mitchell, an Arizona-based sex-crimes prosecutor, to question Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accusing him of sexual assault.Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) said Ms. Mitchell is taking a leave from her position as deputy county attorney in the Maricopa County Attorney's Office in Phoenix. She served as the division chief of the Special Victims Division, which covers sex crimes and family-violence crimes. She has been a prosecutor since 1993.Mr. Grassley said in a statement that Ms. Mitchell was selected for her legal experience and objectivity and that by having one person question Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Kavanaugh it would depoliticize the process. Republican lawmakers also sought to hire a woman to do the questioning so the 11 men on the Judiciary Committee didn't ask a woman about a deeply personal experience."
wsj,FBI Investigation Stokes Tensions,"WASHINGTON -- A political cease-fire achieved by a further FBI investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against Judge Brett Kavanaugh evaporated over the weekend, as the White House fended off accusations it had placed overly restrictive limitations on the probe of its Supreme Court nominee.The one-week-at-most inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, brokered as a last-minute deal Friday between Republican Sen. Jeff Flake and Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, was intended to satisfy concerns that allegations against Judge Kavanaugh weren't being fully vetted before the full Senate took up his nomination.But early signs that the FBI probe would be on a short leash inflamed Democratic criticism that President Trump and fellow Republicans weren't out to explore fully the allegations, while the White House, Senate and FBI all appeared to shift responsibility for the scope of the probe elsewhere.""The FBI's hands must not be tied in this investigation,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel, wrote on Twitter. Later Sunday, Ms. Feinstein asked White House counsel Don McGahn and the director of the FBI to release a copy of the directive sent by the White House to the bureau outlining the scope of the investigation.Late Saturday, the president had declared on Twitter that he wanted the FBI ""to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion.""The contours of the FBI investigation weren't clear and appeared at times to shift, as Mr. Trump and senior administration officials pushed back against reports that the White House directed who would be interviewed as part of a reopening of Judge Kavanaugh's background investigation. Administration officials said they were taking cues from the Senate. Leading the process for the West Wing is Mr. McGahn, who helped prepare Judge Kavanaugh for the questions he would face in Judiciary Committee hearings.The lack of clarity extended to what investigators could ask witnesses, such as whether they would examine the accuracy of Judge Kavanaugh's testimony last week on his drinking habits as a teen.""If the Senate changes what they'd like to see, we'd probably change what we've told the FBI to do,"" a White House official said, adding that the bureau had some flexibility in how it could carry out the background check.The Wall Street Journal reported that the FBI probe would include interviews with the first two women who publicly accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct but not a third, Julie Swetnick. She said in a sworn statement that the nominee attended parties decades ago where she was raped and that he tried to get women drunk at such gatherings. Ms. Swetnick didn't say Mr. Kavanaugh raped her. The judge has repeatedly denied all allegations of sexual misconduct, including one from Christine Blasey Ford that was the subject of last week's hearing.As of Sunday, it was unclear whether Dr. Ford, a California professor, or Judge Kavanaugh would be interviewed by the FBI. A lawyer for Dr. Ford said Sunday there had been no contact from the FBI since the probe was ordered on Friday.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a member of the Judiciary Committee and a close ally of the White House, said Sunday on ABC that the FBI would interview the witnesses Dr. Ford said were present at an early 1980s teenage house party at which she alleged Mr. Kavanaugh assaulted her, as well as Deborah Ramirez, who alleged Mr. Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a party when they were both freshmen at Yale University.Asked if the probe would also include an interview with Ms. Swetnick, Mr. Graham indicated it didn't. Mr. Graham did say Mark Judge, a high-school classmate of Mr. Kavanaugh's who Dr. Ford has said was in the room during her alleged attack, would be interviewed. Ms. Swetnick has alleged Mr. Judge was present when she was victimized in 1982. Mr. Judge's lawyer has denied those allegations and said Mr. Judge doesn't recall the events described by Dr. Ford.A White House official also confirmed that Mr. Graham spelled out during his Sunday morning appearance the list of witnesses to be interviewed.Some senators appeared to be under a different impression about the contours of the investigation. Sunday, three of the critical undecided GOP senators all indicated the FBI should be able to follow the investigation where it leads. Mr. Flake said on CBS that the FBI would be able to conduct additional interviews if necessary and pursue additional lines of inquiry.Information the FBI receives could ""lead to additional interviews that can take place as well,"" Mr. Flake said on ""60 Minutes.""One person familiar with the FBI's thinking said it was unlikely that the shape of the investigation would change without official communication from the White House.The FBI declined to comment on the Kavanaugh probe.The three undecided GOP senators -- Mr. Flake of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- met Friday with Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans in Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell (R., Ky.) said Sunday.Later that day, the committee called for an investigation ""limited to current credible allegations"" against the judge. The statement was purposefully vague as to what that would include because there wasn't consensus among its GOP members, one aide said.Ms. Collins tweeted out support for that statement adding that she was pleased to hear that Mark Judge had indicated he would cooperate with investigators. ""I am confident that the FBI will follow up on any leads that result from the interviews,"" Ms. Collins said in a statement SundayDemocrats said they had never agreed to exclude any claims from the FBI probe and said they had been excluded from a call Friday between Senate Republicans and the White House over the inquiry's scope."
wsj,What Democrats Have Become,"It is still true: What begins as tragedy can end as farce. So it is with the case of Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of assaulting her when she was 15 and he was 17.As of the most recent available moment in this episode, Ms. Ford's lawyer said her client would not appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee until there is a ""full investigation by law-enforcement officials."" Like the Mueller excavations, that could run to the horizon, unable to find anything but unwilling to stop until it finds something.Let us posit that the one thing not at issue here is the truth. As a matter of law and fact, Ms. Ford's accusation can be neither proved nor disproved. This is as obvious now as it must have been when Dianne Feinstein and the other Democrats came into possession of this incident.Surely someone pointed out that based on what was disclosed, this accusation could not be substantiated. To which the Democrats responded: So what? Its political value is that it cannot be disproved. They saw that six weeks before a crucial midterm election, the unresolvable case of Christine Blasey Ford would sit like a stalled hurricane over the entire Republican Party, drowning its candidates in a force they could not stop.In #MeToo, which began in the predations of Harvey Weinstein, Democrats and progressives finally have found a weapon against which there seems to be no defense. It can be used to exterminate political enemies. If one unprovable accusation doesn't suffice, why not produce a second, or third? It's a limitless standard.The Democrats' broader strategy is: Delay the vote past the election; win the Senate by convincing suburban women that Republicans are implacably hostile to them; seize power; and -- the point of it all -- take down the Trump government.This is the ""resistance."" This is what Democrats have become. Resistance is a word and strategy normally found in a revolutionary context, which is precisely the argument made by the left to justify its actions against this presidency since the evening of Nov. 8, 2016. Anything goes. Whatever it takes. Brett Kavanaugh is not much more than a casualty of war.Rather than try to argue or win public issues on substance, the Democrats have become a party that seems to think it can win with muscle alone. Environmentalism emerged in the 1970s as a worthwhile idea that attracted the interest and support of both parties. From Al Gore onward, it became a bludgeon to beat up the other party. Now sexual abuse, an issue originating in utmost seriousness, has been quickly captured and fashioned into a political weapon by the Democratic left.Politics as trench warfare has relieved the Democrats of the burden of thought. Extending the Pelosi Rule -- we have to pass the bill to find out what's in it -- we now have the Gillibrand Standard.Commenting this week on Ford v. Kavanaugh, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, another 2020 presidential aspirant, said, ""I believe it is disqualifying, given what we know."" In other words, what she believes is based on next to nothing.Put on defense by these accusations, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley unsurprisingly agreed to a hearing in which Ms. Ford would tell her story and Judge Kavanaugh would speak. Then the senators would vote.Consider the spectacle: Judge Kavanaugh's nomination for the U.S. Supreme Court, the embodiment of a modern rule of law, is being decided in the Senate by the medieval practice of trial by ordeal, such as surviving immersion in fire or ice. Trial by ordeal was outlawed by the Lateran Council in 1215.Or worse, the standards of the mob in the Roman Colosseum, turning thumbs up or down on the combatants. Though unlike the Senate Democrats, the Roman mob at least had an open mind.Incidentally, the standard trope that Donald Trump has degraded our politics? We don't need to hear that anymore. Or about the moral certitudes of the religious right.Is there a sadder figure in the modern Democratic Party than Sen. Dianne Feinstein? Elected to the Senate in 1992, Mrs. Feinstein has produced a creditable career. Her above-it-all reputation was never quite deserved, but she has at least performed with dignity.Now, seeking re-election at 85, she is getting heat from the progressive-dominated Democratic Party in California, the world capital of identity-only politics. By withholding from the committee the accusatory Ford letter that came into her possession nearly two months ago, Sen. Feinstein ensured the nomination's descent into such a hapless, cynical moment. This will be the most remembered event in Sen. Feinstein's career.The Kavanaugh nomination, ""given what we know,"" has come down to an undiscoverable accusation. The defeat of a Supreme Court nominee on this basis would be a victory for a level of conscious political nullification not seen in the U.S. for a long time. Republicans in the Senate shouldn't allow it, and voters in November should not affirm it."
wsj,Susan Collins Finds A Starring Role,"Sen. Susan Collins, who has clashed with Republican leaders over taxes and health care, on Friday played the role they needed from her: a Republican woman pledging the decisive vote to elevate Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.""I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh,"" she said at the end of a 45-minute speech laying out her rationale -- starting with his judicial opinions, continuing through her thinking about his rights to a fair process, and weighed against accusations from California research psychologist Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her when they were both teenagers.""Certain fundamental legal principles about due process, the presumption of innocence, and fairness do bear on my thinking, and I cannot abandon them,"" Ms. Collins said. ""In evaluating any given claim of misconduct, we will be ill-served in the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence and fairness, tempting though it may be. We must always remember that it is when passions are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy.""It was a decision reached after private consideration, public harassment so intense that she needed a security detail, and lobbying at the highest levels.President George W. Bush, in whose administration Judge Kavanaugh had served as staff secretary, called Ms. Collins to persuade her of the judge's merits. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) had lunch with her on Friday. She was accompanied to a secure facility to review a new Federal Bureau of Investigation background report by Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), who had worked with the judge in the Bush administration.The decision cut between her advocacy for women's issues and traditional Republican Party roots. ""Believe me, I struggled with it for a long time,"" she told reporters on Friday."
