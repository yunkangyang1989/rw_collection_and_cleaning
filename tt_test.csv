Ron Dellums was a hired lobbyist for Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. June 9, 2016, the Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group has learned.

Dellums, who represented liberal San Francisco and Oakland, Calif., is a long-time darling of left-wing political activists. He served 13 terms in Congress as an African-American firebrand and proudly called himself a socialist. He retired in 1996.

The former congressman is one of several high-profile Democratic partisans who was on Veselnitskaya’s payroll, working to defeat a law that is the hated object of a personal vendetta waged by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

A national outcry has erupted in the establishment media about Trump Jr.’s meeting with Veselnitskaya. But there has been little focus on the Democrats who willingly served for years on her payroll helping to wage a Russian-led lobby campaign against the law. Congress passed the legislation, the Magnitsky Act, in response to the murder of Sergei Magnistky, a Russian lawyer who alleged corruption and human rights violations against numerous Russian officials.

According to a complaint filed to the Department of Justice Foreign Agents Registration Act division last July, Dellums failed to register as a foreign agent representing a Russian-driven effort led by Veselnitskaya to repeal the Magnitsky Act.

The act was a bipartisan bill enacted in December 2012 intended to punish Russian officials responsible for the death of Magnitsky, who died in a Moscow prison in 2009. President Barack Obama signed the act into law.

The legislation bars 18 Russians from entering the United States because of the lawyer’s death. Putin retaliated by freezing American adoptions of Russian children and barred 18 Americans from entering Russia.

Magnitsky was a tax lawyer with the Hermitage Fund, a London-based firm that invested in Russia. The tax lawyer uncovered a $230 million scheme allegedly run by Russian mobsters. He informed Russian officials of the corruption.

Instead of investigating Prevezon Holdings Ltd., a Russian-owned firm implicated in the scandal, Russian officials arrested Magnitsky. He died in prison in 2009 after being tortured and killed in prison, according to the Russian Presidential Human Rights Commission.

Prevezon was owned by Denis Katsyv who, along with Veselnitskaya, created the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation in the U.S. The foundation was designed to repeal the Magnitsky Act using a lobbying team that included Dellums.

This is not the first time Dellums’ advanced the interests of dictatorships. As a congressman, he was fond of Cuban President Fidel Castro, and he supported Cuba’s military intervention in Africa.

Dellums also sued President George W. Bush’s 1991 military effort to liberate Kuwait after Saddam Hussein invaded the country.

The former congressman is only one of a notable team of partisan Democrats Veselnitskaya hired to defeat the Magnitsky Act.

Glenn Simpson, founder of Fusion GPS, also joined the Russian lawyer and “worked with her on a legal case for years,” according to The Washington Post.

Fusion GPS is the firm that reportedly commissioned a phony “dossier” authored by former British spy Christopher Steele that alleged salacious and largely erroneous charges about President Donald Trump.

Most news organizations reject the dossier as dubious at best, but it eventually was published by BuzzFeed 10 days before Trump was inaugurated.

Christopher Cooper, the founder and CEO of Potomac Square Group, also joined Veselnitskaya. His company does campaign work for foreign principles and foreign governments including the governments of Azerbaijan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UAE, and Nigeria as well as Russia. The company’s clients have included Democratic California Gov. Jerry Brown and Democratic presidential hopeful Vermont Gov. Howard Dean.

Potomac Square also partnered with Dean’s campaign manger Joe Trippi on behalf of the families of radical Islamic terrorists held at Guantanamo Bay.

The Senate Committee on the Judiciary will convene a hearing next week on the Russian government’s opposition to the Magnitsky Act. Witnesses are expected to include, among others, William Browder, the founder of the Hermitage Fund.

TheDCNF contacted Dellums’ lobby firm but received no reply to inquiries about his role with the Russian lawyer.

1,##########,http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/10/nyt-russian-lawyer-story-proves-dems-helped-create-trump-russia-conspiracy-theory/,NYT Russian Lawyer Story Proves Dems Helped Create Trump-Russia Conspiracy Theory,[],Daily Caller,"The New York Times published a story on Saturday that revealed Donald Trump Jr. met with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a “Russian lawyer who has connections to the Kremlin,” on June 9th, 2016. On Sunday, The Times followed up with a report that said Don Jr. “was promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton before agreeing to meet with [the] Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign, . . .” Paul Manafort, President Trump’s campaign manager at the time, and Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and current advisor, also attended the meeting, according to The Times.

Of course, the typical figures are suggesting that this “proves” that collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government occurred during the election. But the critical detail of who sought to broker the meeting is wholly omitted in both of The Times’ reports. In a statement to The Times, Don Jr. said, “I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.” This individual’s name has not officially been revealed. The Washington Post suggested the person was Rob Goldstone, a music publicist and personal friend of Don Jr. Don Jr. has neither confirmed nor denied Goldstone’s involvement.

Whoever the acquaintance was, subsequent reporting by Circa News said that members of the President’s legal team have confirmed that the acquaintance “who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS.” Based on other contemporaneous events, this account seems highly probable.

It is important to remember exactly what was transpiring in the late spring and early summer of 2016. Specifically, the key timeframe is April-June 2016. It was during this time that three different event trajectories converged: (1) Trump becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, (2) the Democratic National Committee (DNC) learning and disclosing that Russian hackers penetrated its computer network, and (3) Democratic Party operatives hiring Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research on Trump.

Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee either in late April or early May, depending on who you ask. Trump declared himself to be the presumptive nominee on April 26th, after sweeping the primary election contests in Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island, Maryland and Pennsylvania. One week later, on May 3rd, then-chairman of the Republican National Committee Reince Priebus declared Trump to be the presumptive nominee after Trump emerged victorious from the heavily contested Indiana primary contest, which led Republican Texas Senator Ted Cruz to drop out of the race.

Trump’s presumptive nomination is significant here for other, less obvious reasons. That is because, according to The New York Times, during the Republican primaries,

a wealthy Republican donor who strongly opposed Mr. Trump put up the money to hire a Washington research firm run by former journalists, Fusion GPS, to compile a dossier about the real estate magnate’s past scandals and weaknesses.

However, The Times continued,

After Mr. Trump emerged as the presumptive nominee in the spring, the Republican interest in financing the effort ended. But Democratic supporters of Hillary Clinton were very interested, and Fusion GPS kept doing the same deep dives, but on behalf of new clients.

Until this time, there was no known coordinated effort to investigate Trump’s alleged “ties” to Russia. But, as The Times noted, that all changed in June:

In June, the tenor of the effort suddenly changed. The Washington Post reported that the Democratic National Committee had been hacked, apparently by Russian government agents, and a mysterious figure calling himself “Guccifer 2.0” began to publish the stolen documents online.

The above-mentioned Washington Post article was published on June 14th, 2016. What The Post did not note, however, was that the DNC knew Russia was behind the hack long before its article was published.

Public reports confirm the DNC’s early knowledge of Russia’s involvement in the hack. The Washington Post article says “DNC leaders were tipped to the hack in late April.” The specific date, according to a separate report from The New York Times, was “[t]he day before the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner,” which occurred on April 30th, meaning that the DNC was notified of the intrusion on April 29th. Within 24 hours of the notification, The Times reported, the DNC “hired CrowdStrike, a cyber security firm,” which The Washington Post said “installed software on the DNC’s computers so that it could analyze data that could indicate who had gained access, when and how.” A DNC lawyer told The Times that, “Within a day, CrowdStrike confirmed that the intrusion had originated in Russia.”

This means the DNC knew Russia was behind the hack of their computer network on May 1st, 2016.

From this the following timeline emerges:

April 26th, 2016: Trump declares himself the presumptive GOP nominee.

Trump declares himself the presumptive GOP nominee. April 29th, 2016: DNC learns its computer system has been breached.

DNC learns its computer system has been breached. April 30th, 2016: DNC hires CrowdStrike.

Democrats begin funding Fusion GPS. May 1st, 2016: CrowdStrike determines Russia perpetrated the hack.

CrowdStrike determines Russia perpetrated the hack. May 3rd, 2016: Reince Priebus declares Trump the presumptive GOP nominee.

Reince Priebus declares Trump the presumptive GOP nominee. June 9th, 2016: Don Jr. meets with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at the apparent request of a Fusion GPS operative.

Don Jr. meets with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at the apparent request of a Fusion GPS operative. June 14th, 2016: The DNC publicly discloses the Russia hacked its computer network.

The DNC refused to disclose that Russia hacked its computer network for a month-and-a-half, and only disclosed that fact after the Fusion GPS-brokered meeting between Don Jr. and Veselnitskaya.

There is another disturbing aspect of this story. Recall that Don Jr., in both of his statements, said he was never told the name of the individual with whom he was meeting. (Neither story even indicates that Don Jr. knew before the meeting that the individual was a Russian national, let alone a Russian lawyer.) This strongly suggests that Fusion GPS was involved in a dirty tricks campaign that sought to question and undermine Trump’s loyalty to the country by portraying him as a having close ties to the Kremlin, a tactic that has emerged as a primary point of opposition to candidate and now President Trump. Particularly troubling is how early the Democratic Party operatives appear to have been conspiring to make the Russia-Trump connection.

These revelations bring to light for the first time the likely involvement of Democratic operatives in fomenting the Russia-Trump collusion conspiracy theory that is now the subject of multiple Federal and Congressional investigations, which have had the (convenient) effect of slowing Trump’s legislative agenda.

Indeed, the fact that the DNC knew, but kept secret, the fact that Russian hackers were responsible for their computer breach at around the same time that Democratic operatives began funding the group that would go on to broker a meeting between Trump’s inner circle and a high-profile Russian national appears highly sinister.

At the very least, these circumstances warrant an investigation, something that I am confident California Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, the most outspoken Democrat on the Russia conspiracy theory, would support. On the issue of circumstantial evidence acting as the basis for federal investigations, I’ll give Schiff the last word and let his words speak for themselves:"
2,##########,http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/14/russian-lawyer-reportedly-offered-dirt-on-dnc-just-days-before-document-dump/,Russian Lawyer Reportedly Offered Dirt On DNC Just Days Before Document Dump,[],Daily Caller,"A former Soviet military intelligence officer told the Associated Press on Friday that a Russian lawyer he accompanied to a June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower offered to provide information about illicit financial activity carried out by the Democratic National Committee.

Nine days later, on June 18, Guccifer 2.0, the hacker believed to be a front for Russian spy agencies, dropped a bombshell.

“NEW DOCS FROM DNC NETWORK: LOTS OF FINANCIAL REPORTS AND DONORS’ PERSONAL DATA,” was the headline plastered across the Guccifer 2.0 website.

The article included a trove of information about DNC donors and memos related to the Clinton campaign.

On June 20 Guccifer 2.0 announced that that they were planning to release a dossier of information on Clinton. The next day, the website published a slew of files about Clinton that appear to have been hacked from the DNC. (RELATED: Here’s What We Know About Rinat Akhmetshin)

Three days before, Guccifer 2.0 made the first post on the WordPress website. In the post, the hacker(s) claimed that the DNC breach was a one-man operation not connected to the Russian government.

The Trump White House has strongly denied that the campaign participants in the June 9 meeting — Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort — colluded with Russian agents. But details of the meeting provided by the former Soviet counterintelligence officer raise new questions about those denials.

Rinat Akhmethsin, the former Soviet agent and a lobbyist operating in Washington, D.C., told the Associated Press that he attended the meeting along with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer.

The pair were associated with the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, a small non-profit that aims to roll back a law that imposes sanctions on Russian criminals.

Veselnitskaya and Trump Jr. have said that the Trump Tower meeting centered on the Magnitsky Act.

But Akhmetshin said that Veselnitskaya brought a plastic folder full of printed-out documents to the meeting. Veselnitskaya’s documents “detailed her claims about the contributions to the Democratic National Committee,” AP reported.

Akhmetshin said he did not know if the documents came from the Russian government but that he believes that Veselnitskaya left the information with the Trump team members.

The operative, who operates in the shadows of Washington, D.C. but has close contacts to Beltway reporters, claimed that the meeting was “not substantive.”

“I never thought this would be such a big deal to be honest,” he told the wire service.

The presentation of DNC information is somewhat different than what Trump Jr. was promised when he was approached about the meeting on June 3.

Rob Goldstone, a music publicist who works for Trump family associate Emin Agalarov, reached out to Trump Jr. through email that day offering opposition research on Hillary Clinton.

Goldstone said that he wanted Trump Jr. to meet with a “Russian government attorney” who claimed to have “some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

Goldstone was informed of the offer by Agalarov, whose father, Aras Agalarov, is a Russian oligarch close to Russia’s president Vladimir Putin.

“This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,” Goldstone wrote.

Trump Jr. responded to the offer saying, “I love it.”

The revelations about the Trump Tower meeting have drawn new attention to other goings on at that point of the campaign cycle.

On June 7, several hours after Trump Jr. and Goldstone set a time for the meeting, then-candidate Trump said that he would be making a major revelation about Clinton.

“I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week, and we’re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons,” Trump said that night. “I think you’re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting. I wonder if the press will want to attend.”

The White House has said that Trump only recently learned of the Trump Tower meeting. Trump never made the explosive speech, which would have occurred on June 13. The White House has said that the speech was delayed because of the Orlando nightclub shooting the day before.

3,##########,http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/13/exclusive-oppo-researcher-behind-trump-dossier-is-linked-to-pro-kremlin-lobbying-effort/,EXCLUSIVE: Oppo Researcher Behind Trump Dossier Is Linked To Pro-Kremlin Lobbying Effort,[],Daily Caller,"The head of the opposition research firm that is behind the Trump dossier is linked to a secret campaign aimed at undermining the Magnitsky Act, a law that places sanctions on Russian criminals and is vehemently opposed by the Kremlin, The Daily Caller can report.

The main proponent of that law, a British-American businessman named Bill Browder, tells TheDC that Glenn Simpson, the head of Fusion GPS, the company behind the Trump dossier, is a “professional smear campaigner.”

According to Browder, Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, is working with a former Russian counterintelligence officer named Rinat Akhmetshin to destroy the Magnitsky Act, which is named after Browder’s late lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, and was signed into law in Dec. 2012.

“Glenn Simpson knowingly spread false information on behalf of people connected to the Russian government to try to protect Russian torturers and murderers from consequences,” Browder alleged in a phone interview from his office in London on Friday.

“Glenn Simpson’s job was to knowingly and dishonestly change the narrative of how Sergei Magnitsky came to die from murder to natural causes, and to change the narrative that Sergei Magnitsky was a criminal and not a whistleblower,” said Browder, who serves as CEO of the investment firm Hermitage Capital.

Simpson and Fusion GPS were first linked to the anti-Magnitsky effort last month. Politico reported then that Fusion GPS acknowledged that it was hired by the law firm BakerHostetler to dig up dirt on Browder. BakerHostetler was in turn working on behalf of Denis Katsyv, a Russian national who owns a company called Prevezon.

The company is currently the subject of a U.S. federal grand jury investigation based on evidence uncovered by Magnitsky. The Justice Department has frozen $14 million in Prevezon’s assets as part of its investigation.

In his book, “Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man’s Fight for Justice,” Browder lays out the circumstances surrounding Magnitsky’s death.

Browder was once an ally of sorts with Russian president Vladimir Putin. The pair benefited — Browder financially and Putin politically — by going after corrupt Russian oligarchs.

But after Putin became a business partner to many of the oligarchs, the former KGB officer turned against Browder. At the time Russia’s largest foreign investor, Browder was deported from the country in 2005.

Magnitsky, who helped Browder investigate many of the corrupt Russian firms, was arrested in Nov. 2008 and accused of engaging in fraud and tax evasion.

Magnitsky was tortured for months in a Russian prison and deprived of medical treatment, all in order to elicit a false confession that he and Browder were engaged in fraud and tax evasion, Browder has alleged. After Magnitsky’s health deteriorated, he was transferred to another jail. There, the lawyer was allegedly beaten with blunt objects by prison guards. He died on Nov. 16, 2009 at the age of 37.

Soon after his friend’s murder, Browder began lobbying American lawmakers — Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin and Arizona Sen. John McCain, in particular — to pass a law that would provide a mechanism to punish Kremlin-linked Russian criminals. The effort paid off in Dec. 2012 when President Obama signed the Magnitsky Act into law.

Simpson’s work to undermine a bill opposed by the Kremlin adds another layer of mystery to the Trump dossier story. The 35-page document, which was published by BuzzFeed on Tuesday, includes unverified information alleging that Russian intelligence officials have blackmail material on Trump.

The author of the dossier was identified on Wednesday as former MI6 officer Christopher Steele. Steele, who operates a private intelligence firm based in London, reportedly paid Russian contacts to provide information about Trump.

As The New York Times reported, a major Republican donor hired Fusion GPS in Sept. 2015 to dig up dirt on Trump. But as Trump ascended to the GOP nomination, the donor backed away from the project and Fusion GPS found a Hillary Clinton supporter to continue the project.

Fusion hired Steele seven months ago, The Times reported. The former spy eventually shared his dossier with the FBI and the British government. Meanwhile, Fusion GPS appears to have shopped the dossier around the Washington D.C.-based reporters around the election.

Politico appears to have referenced the dossier in its report last month, stating that Fusion “also discussed information with journalists about Trump and his associates’ ties to Russia.” A BBC reporter also reported this week that he was provided the dossier by the firm just before the election.

Browder has accused Simpson, Akhmetshin, BakerHostetler and others of failing to register as lobbyists under the Lobbying Disclosure Act and the Foreign Agents Registration Act. He also says that the lobbying disclosures that have been filed are incomplete and misleading.

He lodged a complaint with the Justice Department on the matter in July.

The complaint notes that Akhmetshin and Katsyv earlier this year created a Delaware-based non-profit called The Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation (HRAGIF). Browder alleges that the organization serves as a front to surreptitiously lobby against the Magnitsky Act.

Akhmetshin and HRAGIF have filed lobbying disclosure reports with Congress. But the disclosure forms state that Akhmetshin was lobbying for “foreign adoption reinstatement.”

Adoption cases are linked to the Magnitsky Act because of Putin’s response to passage of the law. The autocrat enacted a ban against American citizens adopting Russian children.

Though adoption was the reason that Akhmetshin and HRAGIF gave for their lobbying work, Politico provided independent confirmation that the Magnitsky Act was the true focus of the campaign.

The website reported that a lawyer for BakerHostetler briefed congressional staff ahead of a vote to expand the law globally. In another article, Politico reported that in May, Akhmetshin visited the offices of California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican who has long admired Putin. Akhmetshin’s visit came a day before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs was set to consider the Global Magnitsky Act.

Akhmetshin acknowledged to Politico then that he is a former Russian counterintelligence officer. The ex-spy did not respond to TheDC’s request for comment for this article.

Not much is known about the former spook, who was affiliated with GRU, Russia’s main intelligence directorate. A longtime Washington, D.C. lobbyist, he was accused in a 2015 lawsuit of hacking into the computers of International Mineral Resources. The company at the time was involved in a $1 billion lawsuit with EuroChem Volga-Kaliy, a Russian fertilizer company.

As for Simpson, Browder alleged in his DOJ complaint that the reporter’s anti-Magnitsky push involved digging into his deep network of journalistic contacts.

In his DOJ filing, Browder claimed that four journalists with the Financial Times, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal all confirmed “that Glenn Simpson has been hired by Prevezon to lobby for the anti-Magnitsky Campaign.”

TheDC was unable to independently verify that Simpson contacted the reporters on the issue.

The Justice Department declined to comment on the status of Browder’s complaint. Fusion GPS did not respond to requests for comment.

In an interview with RT, Russia’s state-owned news outlet, Natalia Veselnitskaya, the attorney, accused a London-based financier named Bill Browder of being behind the “mass hysteria” surrounding the June 9, 2016 meeting.

Veselnitskaya claims that she attended the meeting in order to lobby the Trump campaign against the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 sanctions law championed by Browder.

But the meeting was set up after Donald Trump Jr. was offered derogatory information about Hillary Clinton from an acquaintance. Trump Jr. was told that a “Russian government attorney” would be providing the information.

Trump Jr. eagerly accepted the offer, even after being told that the information was being provided as part of the Russian government’s support for the Trump campaign. Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort attended the meeting on the Trump campaign side, and Veselnitskaya was accompanied by several Russians, including a Russian-American lobbyist who some believe is linked to Russia’s intelligence apparatus.

While Veselnitskaya has acknowledged in previous interviews that she discussed Clinton during the meeting, she has fixed her attention on Browder, whom she often berates on her various social media accounts.

Veselnitskaya says that she would be willing to testify before the Senate in order to discuss both the Trump Tower meeting and Browder.

“If the Senate wishes to hear the real story, I will be happy to speak up and share everything I wanted to tell Mr. Trump,” she said of Browder, the CEO of Hermitage Capital.

Veselnitskaya claims that Browder has fabricated details of the death of Sergei Magnitsky, his former attorney and the namesake for the Magnitsky Act.

Browder has claimed that Magnitsky was tortured and murdered in a Russian prison in 2009 after being jailed for investigating a $230 million money laundering scheme against his company.

Veselnitskaya claims that Browder is who committed financial fraud in the case and has crafted a legend surrounding Magnitsky in order to cover it up.

In order to discredit Browder, Veselnitskaya worked last year with Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that is also behind the infamous dossier of research accusing President Trump of colluding with Russia during the presidential campaign.

Veselnitskaya may soon get to talk to Congress. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said over the weekend that he wants to talk to all eight of the participants in the Trump Tower meeting.

5,##########,http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/12/russian-lawyer-has-ties-to-firm-that-compiled-trump-dossier/,Russian Lawyer Has Ties To Firm That Compiled Trump Dossier,[],Daily Caller,"The Russian lawyer who offered Donald Trump Jr. damaging information about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reportedly has ties to the opposition research firm that commissioned the dossier on President Donald Trump.

When the June 2016 meeting took place, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was in New York to defend Prevezon, a Russian holding firm accused of laundering money for corrupt Russian businessmen. Veselnitskaya had been working on the case for years with assistance from Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that compiled the Trump dossier.

Fusion GPS denied any knowledge of, or role in, facilitating the meeting between Veselnitskaya and Trump Jr.

“Fusion GPS learned about this meeting from news reports and had no prior knowledge of it,” the company told The Washington Post. “Any claim that Fusion GPS arranged or facilitated this meeting in any way is false.”

The 2016 meeting at Trump Tower concluded after Trump Jr. realized Veselnitskaya had no information on Clinton and her true motivation was to gain an audience to voice her opposition to Russia sanctions.

Specifically, Veselnitskaya was there to criticize the Magnitsky Act, which imposed heavy sanctions on Russian businessmen connected to the 2009 murder of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky.

Magnitsky was killed in prison after uncovering a $230 million fraud perpetrated by corrupt Russian officials. He uncovered the fraud while representing Hermitage Capital founder William Browder. Hermitage’s assets were seized by corrupt Russian officials in 2006.

Magnitsky testified against the corrupt Russian Interior Ministry officials who committed the tax fraud. He was imprisoned for 358 days by those same officials, tortured and eventually beaten to death.

In response to Magnitsky’s murder, Browder lobbied Congress to impose sanctions on the Russian officials involved in the seizing of his firm’s assets and Magnitsky’s subsequent murder. The resulting sanctions infuriated Putin, who responded by banning American adoption of Russian children.

“Repealing the Magnitsky Act was the single biggest priority of Vladimir Putin and she was acting as the single most active proxy of the Russian government to achieve that objective in Washington,” Browder told The Washington Post. “I’m sure that this was an attempt by the Russian government to repeal sanctions that annoyed them by going to the possible next president of the United States.”

Veselnitskaya has been heavily involved in lobbying efforts to repeal the Magnitsky Act for years, specifically in her role defending Prevezon, a Russian holding company accused by the Department of Justice of laundering a portion of the $230 million in fraudulently reclaimed Hermitage taxes.

Before Fusion GPS became embroiled in the Trump dossier scandal, the firm was contracted by BakerHostetler in 2013 to assist with the Prevezon case, it was in the course of their work on the Prevezon case that Fusion GPS had contact with Veselnitskaya, as her firm, Kamerton Consulting, personally represented Prevezon’s owner Denis Katsyv.

The case settled in May, Prevezon had to pay the U.S. government $6 million but did not have to admit they laundered the illegally obtained funds.

Fusion GPS’ denial of involvement in the meeting hasn’t prevented the Trump legal team from building a narrative around Veselnitskaya’s connection to the now well known opposition research firm.

Spokesman for Trump’s outside counsel, Mark Corallo, emphasized Veselnitskaya’s relationship with Fusion GPS.

“Specifically, we have learned that the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS, a firm which according to public reports, was retained by Democratic operatives to develop opposition research on the president and which commissioned the phony Steele dossier,” Corallo said in the Monday statement.

Bill Browder says that he will “definitely” be testifying about a complaint he filed with the Justice Department last year in which he accused Fusion GPS, the firm behind the dossier, and a former Soviet intelligence officer named Rinat Akhmetshin of violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), a law requiring agents of foreign governments to disclose their lobbying and consulting work.

Founded by former Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson, Fusion GPS investigated Browder last year as part of an influence campaign aimed at neutering the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law which allows for sanctions against Russians accused of human rights abuses.

At around the same time, Fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele to research Trump’s activities in Russia. Fusion was working for an unidentified political ally of Hillary Clinton’s.

Browder is not linked to or identified in the dossier, but he has said that Fusion GPS’s involvement on the anti-Magnitsky effort raises questions about the veracity of the anti-Trump research.

“Glenn Simpson knowingly spread false information on behalf of people connected to the Russian government to try to protect Russian torturers and murderers from consequences,” Browder told TheDC in January, just after BuzzFeed news published Steele’s dossier. (RELATED: Opposition Research Firm Behind Trump Dossier Worked On Pro-Kremlin Lobbying Effort)

Browder was the leading force behind the campaign to pass the Magnitsky Act, a move which angered Russian president Vladimir Putin. Putin retaliated by barring U.S. citizens from adopting Russian children.

Fusion’s work on the two projects — one favorable to the Kremlin (Magnitsky) and the other unfavorable (the dossier) — has drawn attention from Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Grassley has inquired with the firm and with the FBI about the salacious dossier, which Steele began compiling last June.

The Republican has questioned why the FBI reportedly used an uncorroborated document financed by a Clinton ally as part of the basis for its investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government. (RELATED: Trump Dossier Firm Refuses To Identify Its Political Clients)

Grassley has also asked the FBI about reports that the bureau informally agreed to pay Steele $50,000 to continue his research on Trump. That payment was reportedly never made, though it is unclear why. Both the FBI and Fusion GPS have avoided answering Grassley’s questions about the dossier.

In his letters to the FBI, Grassley has cited a complaint that Browder filed with the Justice Department last July. In that document, Browder said that Fusion GPS was waging an opposition research campaign against him on behalf of a Russian businessman who was under investigation in the U.S. for money laundering.

Fusion GPS had been hired by the international law firm, BakerHostetler. The law firm was in turn was working for Denis Katsyv, the head of a Cyprus-based company called Prevezon Holdings.

Sergei Magnitsky, the namesake for the Magnitsky Act, was Browder’s lawyer during the 2000s, when the financier did business in Russia. Magnitsky died under mysterious circumstances in a Russian jail in 2009. He was imprisoned after uncovering a $230 million money laundering scheme that targeted Browder’s businesses.

Prevezon, Denis Katsyv’s company, was implicated in the money laundering scheme. Prevezon reached a $6 million settlement with the U.S. government in the case in May.

Browder tells TheDC that he will testify about Fusion GPS, Simpson, BakerHostetler lawyer Mark Cymrot, and Akhmetshin, the former Soviet agent who is now a Washington, D.C.-based lobbyist and consultant.

Akhmetshin was the lobbyist of record for a group formed last year called the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation (HRAGIF).

The organization’s official mission was to end the Russian adoption ban implemented by Putin. But in reality, HRAGIF used adoption as a dangle to compel U.S. lawmakers to revise the Magnitsky Act. (RELATED: Russian Lawyer Secured Trump Tower Meeting By Promising Dirt On Hillary Clinton)

News outlets like Politico and The Daily Beast reported last year that Akhmetshin was seen on Capitol Hill lobbying members of Congress specifically against the Magnitsky Act.

The anti-Magnitsky campaign took a new twist over the weekend after it was revealed that a Russian lawyer named Natalia Veselnitskaya met on June 9, 2016 with Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.

Veselnitskaya is a lawyer for Katsyv, the Russian businessman, and co-founder of HRAGIF.

It emerged over the weekend that Veselnitskaya secured the Trump Tower meeting by claiming that she had derogatory information about Hillary Clinton. But Trump Jr. said in a statement that Veselnitskaya offered little information about Clinton. Instead, she turned the 20-minute meeting into a discussion of the Magnitsky Act.

After The New York Times reported the existence of the meeting on Saturday, Trump’s legal team pointed to Veselnitskaya’s work on Magnitsky and that lobbying campaign’s links to Fusion GPS. A spokesman for Trump’s legal team suggested that the Russian lawyer could have sought to compromise the campaign.

It has since emerged that Trump Jr. was approached for the meeting by Rob Goldstone, a music publicist who works for Emin Agalarov, a Kazakh musician whose billionaire father is close to the Russian government.

The Trumps and Agalarovs have done business together, most notably on the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.

As for Akhmetshin, he has worked for years as a political operative in Washington, D.C.

In 2014, he was accused of hacking the computer systems of a company called International Mineral Resources on behalf of EuroChem Volga-Kaliy, a Swiss fertilizer company controlled by a Russian oligarch.

In a deposition the next year, Akhmetshin denied hacking the company, saying that he obtained documents about the firm through something called the London information bazaar, a secretive exchange network used by journalists and investigators.

Patrick Salisbury, a lawyer for EuroChem, said in a sworn statement that Akhmetshin had “deep contacts” to reporters at prestigious news outlets like the Wall Street Journal and The Guardian. He also obtains research from Global Witness, a non-profit group that is heavily funded by progressive billionaire George Soros, Salisbury said.

Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, Rob Goldstone and Natalia Veselnitskaya — it is now widely known — took part in the meeting, which Trump Jr. granted after being told he would be provided with derogatory information about Hillary Clinton.

Goldstone, a British music publicist, had informed Trump Jr. that Veselnitskaya, a Russian attorney, would be providing the Clinton dirt.

NBC News reported early Friday that Veselnitskaya, who does not speak English, was accompanied by a Russian-American lobbyist who some U.S. officials believe is a former Soviet counterintelligence officer. NBC also reported that a lawyer for Trump Jr. said that Veselnitskaya was accompanied by a second man, though no details were provided about him.

The Associated Press confirmed after NBC’s report that the Russian-American lobbyist is Rinat Akhmetshin.

Veselnitskaya works closely with another Russian emigre other than the suspected former Soviet spy.

Anatoli Samochornov, a Russia-born professional translator who worked as a part-time contractor for the State Department, worked with Veselnitskaya last year on an effort to roll back the Magnitsky Act, a law passed in 2012 which allows for sanctions against Russians accused of human rights abuses.

[Update: Samochornov confirmed to other news outlets after this article was published that attended the Trump Tower meeting as Veselnitskaya’s translator.]

Veselnitskaya has used Samochornov’s translation services in court proceedings for cases she has in the U.S. The pair are also founding members of an obscure non-profit group registered in Delaware called the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation (HRAGIF).

Reached by phone on Wednesday, Samochornov declined to discuss his work with Veselnitskaya, citing confidentiality agreements preventing him from discussing clients. TheDC asked him if he was involved in the Trump Tower meeting, but he declined to say.

Samochornov ended the phone call before he could be asked a series of questions about his work for the State Department.

A State Department official confirmed to TheDC that Samochornov was a contractor for the agency through Meridian International Center, a non-profit public diplomacy organization. The contract under which Samochornov worked ended in September, the official said.

Samochornov has also worked for State’s Office of Language Services as a contract interpreter for exchange programs.

The duo’s non-profit, HRAGIF, claims to advocate for the adoption of Russian children by Americans, which was banned by Russian president Vladimir Putin in retaliation for passage of the Magnitsky Act. Akhmetshin, the suspected former Soviet intelligence officer who attended the Trump Tower meeting, is a registered lobbyist for HRAGIF.

He was identified in reports last year as having lobbied U.S. lawmakers to rollback the Magnitsky Act.

Emails first reported last year by The Daily Beast show that Samochornov and Veselnitskaya worked closely to undercut the Magnitsky Act by setting up the screening of a film that questioned the story of the law’s namesake, a Russian lawyer named Sergei Magnitsky.

Samochornov also appears to be Veselnitskaya’s go-to translator.

Bill Browder, a London-based investor who has accused Veselnitskaya of violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act because of her anti-Magnitsky lobbying, told TheDC that Samochornov translated for the lawyer during his deposition for the legal case involving Katsyv.

That case was settled in May with Katsyv’s company, Prevezon Holdings, agreeing with the Justice Department to pay a $6 million fine. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have pressed the Justice Department to find out whether Veselnitskaya’s meeting with Trump Jr. had anything to do with the settlement of the case.

Browder was deposed in the case because money stolen from his companies back in 2007 was allegedly laundered through the U.S. real estate market by Prevezon Holdings and other Russian companies.

Browder is the leading proponent behind the Magnitsky Act. Sergei Magnitsky was Browder’s lawyer when he uncovered the $230 million money laundering scheme targeting the financiers’ firms. Magnitsky died under mysterious circumstances in 2009 in a Russian prison, where he was sent after being accused (falsely, says Browder) of perpetuating a fraud scheme of his own.

Samochornov, whose wife lists herself on social media as a program officer at the State Department, recently translated for Veselnitskaya and Katsyv during a court hearing held in the Prevezon case on May 3.

Katsyv’s American lawyers filed a request asking the judge on the case to allow Samochornov to use a portable FM tour guide system to help translate for the two Russians.

Samochornov lists himself as a State Department and Meridian International Center employee on his LinkedIn profile.

Though the page appears to have not been updated recently, Samochornov says that has worked as an “Interpreter at high level UN and private sector meetings for the Secretary of State and other VIPs.”

He has also worked to “develop programs that establish an understanding of US foreign policy goals and objectives for current and future international leaders” and represented the U.S. government “in securing cooperation of key U.S. resources in corporate, governmental and NGO community.”

It is unclear if Samochornov would have required security clearances in those roles, though they would seem to involve sensitive diplomatic issues. He ended the phone call with TheDC before that question could be asked, and the State Department typically does not discuss security clearance status for employees and contractors.

Goldstone, who helped set up the Trump Tower meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, did not respond to emails asking for information about the lawyer’s translator. Veselnitskaya also did not respond to requests sent through Facebook and email.

Whoever accompanied Veselnitskaya to the Trump Tower meeting will be of interest to federal investigators, says Ron Hosko, a former assistant director of the FBI’s criminal division.

Hosko told TheDC that investigators, including special counsel Robert Mueller, will want to know “what is the pedigree of the attorney and of any translator in the room or involved in any way” in the Trump Tower meeting.

As for what allegedly occurred in the meeting, both Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya claim that no Clinton research was exchanged. Instead, both say that Veselnitskaya lobbied hard against the Magnitsky Act.

The meeting has drawn massive attention because of Veselnitskaya’s connections to the Russian government. In his initial outreach to Trump Jr., Goldstone referred to Veselnitskaya as a “Russian government attorney.”

This article has been updated with additional information reported by NBC News regarding the people who attended the Trump Tower meeting.

Thor Halvorssen, the founder of the Human Rights Foundation, says in a letter to the committee that Fusion GPS targeted him and several other people because of their criticism of Derwick Associates, a Venezuelan energy company reportedly under investigation for an alleged multi-billion dollar kickback scheme.

Fusion GPS are “highly paid smear experts,” Halvorssen says in the testimony, a copy of which was obtained by The Daily Caller.

Halvorssen alleges that Fusion GPS — which was founded by a group of ex-Wall Street Journal reporters — was working for Derwick Associates when it spread false rumors in the media that he is a pedophile and drug addict. Halvorssen also details what he says was told to him by Jose de Cordoba, a Wall Street Journal reporter who worked on an investigative piece about Derwick Associates in July 2014.

According to Halvorssen, as de Cordoba was finishing up his reporting, he was called to a meeting in Caracas with Peter Fritsch, his former boss at the Journal and one of Fusion’s co-founders.

Halvorssen, who began researching Derwick in 2012 and was a source for de Cordoba, says that the reporter told him that he viewed the meeting as an intimidation tactic. He also said that Fritsch provided derogatory information about the activist and other Derwick critics.

The Daily Caller spoke to a former senior U.S. government official who said that de Cordoba also told him of the Caracas meeting. The official said that meeting was requested by Derwick’s representatives in order to stave off publication of the Journal article, which would be embarrassing to the company because it detailed a scheme to overbill the Venezuelan government billions of dollars to build power plants and provide kickbacks to Venezuelan officials.

De Cordoba’s article never appeared in the Journal, and Halvorssen claims that Fusion GPS and lawyers for Derwick successfully killed the piece by threatening legal action. TheDC was also able to view a letter that a Derwick attorney sent to the Journal the same month of the Caracas meeting.

Halvorssen, who was born in Venezuela and is of Norwegian descent, was invited by the Senate Judiciary Committee to submit his testimony ahead of its hearing on the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).

Halvorssen alleges in his testimony that Fusion GPS has violated the law by working on behalf of Derwick, which he says is closely aligned with the Venezuelan government.

Glenn Simpson, Fusion’s chief executive and co-founder, was subpoenaed to testify at the hearing. After threatening to plead the Fifth, he reportedly agreed on Tuesday to talk to the committee in private. (RELATED: Fusion GPS Founder Will Plead The Fifth)

Mystery surrounds Fusion GPS, which Simpson founded in 2010, a year after leaving the Journal, where he was highly regarded as an expert on terror financing and money laundering cases.

The firm has refused to identity the Republican and Democratic clients who hired it to investigate Trump during the presidential campaign. The Republican, described as a wealthy donor who disliked Trump, hired Fusion GPS in Sept. 2015. By the following June, after Trump won the GOP nomination, Fusion GPS found an ally of Hillary Clinton’s to pay for the anti-Trump research project.

That’s when Fusion brought in Steele, a former MI6 agent who operates Orbis Business Intelligence in London.

Steele ended up writing 35 page of memos containing unsubstantiated allegations of Trump’s sexual perversion and election collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government. The FBI has reportedly met with Steele and relied on the dossier as part of its Trump-Russia collusion investigation.

The business relationship between Fusion GPS and Orbis is also shrouded in mystery.

Steele revealed in court papers filed in the UK in May that Orbis first contracted with Fusion GPS in Jan. 2010.

One small but intriguing revelation in that filing is that Orbis first hired Fusion in 2010, a reversal of the roles in the dossier contract where Fusion hired Steele’s outfit.

***

In his testimony, Halvorssen theorizes about why there has been almost no media coverage of the Derwick case despite law enforcement agencies probing the company’s activities. And the reason for that, he says, is Fusion GPS.

Halvorssen asserts that in addition to smearing opponents of its clients, Fusion GPS draws on its partners’ experience as reporters to place stories in the press, and sometimes kill articles unfavorable to their clients. He also claims, though without providing evidence, that Fusion GPS has paid reporters to smear their enemies.

“I urge you to probe into Fusion GPS’s Venezuelan activities and especially into their willingness to pay journalists in exchange for the publication of baseless smears,” Halvorssen says in the testimony.

Alek Boyd, a former associate of Halvorssen’s, says he was also targeted in a smear campaign because he drew attention to Derwick’s alleged financial misdeeds. He said he also faced false allegations of being a pedophile, sexual deviant and drug addict.

“Fusion is basically a pen-for-hire shop, whose owners are prepared to concoct completely spurious stories that are fed to media contacts developed over years of legitimate work in reputable outlets,” Boyd claimed to TheDC.

Halvorssen’s sentiments about Fusion GPS are echoed by Bill Browder, a London-based financial manager who will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.

Browder, the CEO of Hermitage Capital, became a Fusion GPS target because of his work to pass the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law that blacklists Russian businessmen accused of human rights abuses.

Fusion GPS was hired to investigate Browder on behalf of Denis Katsyv, a Russian businessman whose company, Prevezon Holdings, faced a civil case in the U.S. because of an investigation conducted by Sergei Magnitsky, Browder’s lawyer and the namesake for the sanctions bill.

Magnitsky died in a Russian jail in 2009. Browder says he was tortured and killed because his investigation uncovered a $230 million money laundering scheme involving Kremlin-connected Russian businessmen.

The Russian side, possibly relying on information compiled by Fusion GPS, has attempted to undermine the Magnitsky Act by claiming that Browder is attempting to cover up his own money laundering scheme.

Browder denies that allegation and has questioned the veracity of the Trump dossier because of Simpson’s involvement in the project.

In an interview in January with TheDC, Browder blasted Simpson, saying that he “knowingly spread false information on behalf of people connected to the Russian government to try to protect Russian torturers and murderers from consequences.” (RELATED: Oppo Researcher Behind Trump Dossier Did Work On Pro-Kremlin Lobbying Effort)

That story came full circle earlier this month after it was revealed that Denis Katsyv’s Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, met last June with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower. The man who set up that meeting, Rob Goldstone, told Trump Jr. that Veselnitskaya — who was described as a “Russian government attorney” — would provide opposition research about Hillary Clinton.

Also in that meeting was Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet intelligence official who some U.S. officials think may still be an active Russian agent. Akhmetshin is a Washington, D.C.-based lobbyist, who like Simpson, has deep connections to Beltway reporters, private investigators, and political operatives.

Though Fusion GPS says that the firm was not aware of the Trump Tower meeting before it was reported in the news, one unanswered question is whether Akhmetshin was involved in the Trump dossier project.

One source who knows both operatives told TheDC that the two have at least “crossed paths” in the relatively small world of high-stakes opposition research.

A lawyer for Fusion GPS told TheDC earlier this month that the firm has not worked with Akhmetshin. But New York Times reporter Ken Vogel reported on Twitter recently that sources told him that Akhmetshin has worked with Simpson for years, first as a source when Simpson was at the Journal and now as a researcher.

Little else is known about Fusion GPS’s other projects, which are shielded from publicity by non-disclosure agreements and confidentiality clauses.

One project that has received almost no attention is Fusion GPS’s work for the hedge fund operated by Paul Singer, a major GOP donor.

Intelligence Online reported in 2014 that Singer’s fund, Elliott Management Corporation, hired Fusion to investigate the Argentine government and provide PR and media relations as part of the firm’s dispute over a multi-billion dollar bond investment.

Singer’s firm eventually prevailed in the dispute and was able to buy bonds for pennies on the dollar.

Reached for comment about the report that Singer hired Fusion GPS to work on the Argentine bond case, a spokesman for the billionaire said that the firm is unable to comment on its work with private investigators due to confidentiality agreements.

The spokesman declined to comment on the record regarding whether Singer hired Fusion GPS to investigate Trump. But Intelligence Online has also reported that both the hedge fund and Fusion denied that they were involved in the Trump research project.

Prior to the dossier revelation, Fusion GPS was perhaps best known as the firm hired by Planned Parenthood to discredit undercover videos recorded by the Center for Medical Progress.

Fusion GPS published a report downplaying the significance of the videos, which showed some Planned Parenthood doctors discussing the sale of fetal tissue. The report was widely cited in the press, though often without disclosure that Fusion GPS was working for Planned Parenthood. (RELATED: Oppo Firm Behind Trump Dossier Was Hired Gun For Planned Parenthood)

Fusion GPS also investigated Frank VanderSloot, an Idaho billionaire who says he was targeted by Fusion GPS after donating $1 million to Mitt Romney in 2012. An intern working for Fusion contacted court houses in Idaho looking for dirt on VanderSloot. Soon after, negative stories about him began to appear in national and local news outlets.

Fusion GPS did not respond to a list of questions about its work with Derwick, Steele and on other projects.

After reaching out to Jose de Cordoba, the Wall Street Journal reporter who worked the Derwick story, the newspaper issued a statement saying that it “is proud of its strong coverage of various aspects of politics and business in Venezuela.”

“Our editorial decisions are independent and in keeping with our long tradition of tough and fair reporting. That reporting includes an Aug. 8, 2014, article that was at the forefront in noting federal and New York City preliminary investigations into the Venezuelan company Derwick Associates,” Wall Street Journal spokesman Steve Severinghaus said in the statement.

In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee sent on Friday, lawyers for Fusion GPS said that disclosing the information about the firm’s opposition research project would undercut its First Amendment privileges and violate confidentiality agreements.

As has been widely reported, an unidentified Republican donor hired Fusion GPS in late 2015 to research Trump. But after the real estate magnate won the Republican primary, the donor dropped from the project. But Fusion GPS soon found another client, this one a Democratic ally of Hillary Clinton’s.

Fusion hired former British spy Christopher Steele to research Trump’s Russia connections. He produced a series of memos now known collectively as the dossier. The salacious document, much of which has been debunked, was leaked to numerous news outlets and published by BuzzFeed on Jan. 10.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary committee, has taken an interest in the Democratic dossier donor’s identity, largely because the FBI used the document as part of the basis for its investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.

“When political opposition research becomes the basis for law enforcement or intelligence efforts, it raises substantial questions about the independence of law enforcement and intelligence from politics,” Grassley wrote in a March 24 letter to Glenn Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter and owner of Fusion GPS.

Grassley has also pressed the FBI and Fusion to reveal details of their relationships with Steele. The bureau reportedly met with Steele multiple times to discuss the information in the dossier. In October, an informal deal was struck to pay Steele $50,000 to continue his research. The FBI reportedly ended up not making the payment, though it is unclear why.

One of Fusion’s arguments for not providing information to the Senate Judiciary Committee is that the FBI is likely to have the information being sought by the panel.

“The gravamen of your oversight investigation is whether the FBI complied with its own policy on working with paid informants,” reads Fusion’s letter. “The FBI can answer those questions, without forcing Fusion GPS to waive its constitutional and common law privileges and rights or those of its clients.”

This is the second time that Fusion GPS has refused to provide information to the committee. The Washington, D.C.-based company rebuffed the committee’s requests in April. The led to a subpoena threat from Grassley earlier this month.

In its latest letter, Fusion GPS says that it consulted with its political clients about the committee’s inquiry. But the unidentified financiers appear to not want their identity revealed.

Fusion GPS also appears to acknowledge that it has given the dossier to news organizations.

“In the June 7 letter, citing an article from The New York Times, you questioned whether waiver occurred ‘based on Fusion’s efforts to share the dossier with journalists and members of Congress.’ Without confirming or denying that story, releasing a report to a third party (including, but not limited to the government) would not cause a waiver of privilege,” Fusion’s lawyers said.

It is not entirely clear whether Fusion is BuzzFeed’s source for the dossier. But a reporter for BBC has acknowledged that Fusion gave him a copy of Steele’s memos prior to the Nov. 8 election.

Grassley has also pressed Fusion GPS over its work last year on behalf of a Russian businessman under investigation in the U.S. Fusion was hired by the law firm BakerHostetler, which had been hired by Prevezon Holdings, a Cyprus-based company which recently settled a money laundering case in the U.S.

Prevezon’s owner, Denis Katcyz, also hired a former Russian spy named Rinat Akhmetshin to lobby Congress to help roll back U.S. sanctions against Russia. (RELATED: Oppo Researcher Behind Trump Dossier Is Linked To Pro-Kremlin Lobbying Effort)

Correction: This article initially stated that Fusion GPS worked for Akhmetshin. The company instead worked for the law firm BakerHostetler, which worked last year for a lobbying client of Akhmetshin’s.

Those same media outlets, which have enthusiastically pounced on every new detail regarding the Russia investigation, have been oddly uninterested in probing into the crucial role of Fusion GPS.

The British spy Fusion GPS hired to craft the dossier, Christopher Steele, leaned on anonymous Russian sources in crafting the dossier for Fusion GPS. Steele’s lawyers revealed in court filings that, in September 2016, Steele briefed reporters from The New York Times, The Washington Post, Yahoo! News, The New Yorker and CNN on behalf of Fusion GPS. Steele later held another meeting with reporters from the NYT, WaPo and Yahoo. The lawyers said that Fusion GPS attended these meetings with reporters and Steele, as TheDC’s Chuck Ross pointed out.

Fusion GPS, which is headed up by former Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson, was working for a Democratic ally of Hillary Clinton at that time, although that ally’s name is not publicly known.

Those same media outlets that worked with Fusion GPS to receive information on the Republican nominee now appear to be helping Fusion GPS stay out of the public spotlight. (RELATED: Fusion GPS Was Also A Hired Gun For Planned Parenthood)

A British-American businessman previously targeted by Fusion GPS, Bill Browder, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday that “in the Spring and Summer of 2016 they [Fusion GPS] were receiving money indirectly from a senior Russian government official” for their work to undermine the Magnitsky Act, a human rights law fiercely opposed by Putin that sanctions Russian criminals. At the same time that Fusion GPS was crafting the dossier allegedly exposing the Trump campaign’s collusion with the Russian government, they were also working to advance Russian interests, according to Browder’s testimony.

Browder told the committee that Natalia Veselnitskaya, the same Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort at Trump Tower during the campaign, “hired Glenn Simpson of the firm Fusion GPS to conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of congressional hearings on the Global Magnitsky Act.” The law is named for Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who represented Browder before Russian authorities jailed and killed Magnitsky after he exposed a massive fraud scheme.

Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberly Strassel argued that Browder’s testimony raises the question of whether Russian operatives could have purposefully misled Steele into publishing false allegations of Trump’s Russia ties for the purpose of sowing discord into American politics. (RELATED: Oppo Researcher Behind Trump Dossier Is Linked To Pro-Kremlin Lobbying Effort)

“If the Russian intention was to sow chaos in the American political system, few things could have been more effective than that dossier, which ramped up an FBI investigation and sparked congressional probes and a special counsel, deeply wounding the president,” Strassel wrote. “This is all to Mr. Putin’s benefit, and the question is whether Russia engineered it.”

Strassel is one of the few establishment media sources willing to ask hard questions about Simpson and Fusion GPS.

The NYT, WaPo and CNN have all appeared uninterested in digging into Fusion GPS’ shady ties. The three outlets have combined for zero articles mentioning Fusion GPS since Browder’s testimony, despite the explosive allegations contained within it. (RELATED: Grassley Blasts Dems For Blocking Hearing On Trump Dossier)

The only mention of Fusion GPS on CNN after Browder’s testimony on Thursday (and in the days since) came from Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who went out of his way in an interview Thursday morning to stress the seriousness of the matter, despite CNN asking zero questions about Fusion GPS.

“Fusion GPS was on the payroll, apparently, according to this guy of the Russian government. And I want to know what they did in terms of trying to compromise Donald Trump, who is now our president. So what should we learn from all of this? That the Russians were involved on both sides, they definitely tried to tip the scale against Clinton and for Trump. But the Fusion GPS organization that was trying to get the goods on Donald Trump was backed by the Russians,” Graham said.

CNN reporter Manu Raju tried to steer Graham back to talking about Trump, asking a question about Donald Trump Jr., but Graham returned to the subject to emphasize just how grave he believed the Fusion GPS situation to be.

“The GPS, Fusion GPS situation, the guy’s not coming. If we have to subpoena the people at Fusion GPS, we need to subpoena them. Because Mr. Browder has now accused them of — working for the Russians,” Graham said. “And at the end of the day, if that’s true, the Democratic Party is working with somebody who was working with the Russians, whether they knew it or not.”

CNN’s next question changed the topic to Attorney General Jeff Sessions."

I know you want salacious, sensational coverage for ratings … but that’s not media.”

Gorka has become a frequent critic of CNN, calling them “fake news” and accusing the network of media bias against President Donald Trump in a quest for ratings. Cooper asked if the White House was in crisis mode after Donald Trump Jr.’s email chain showed he met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in 2016 for opposition research on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

“The president is a steam locomotive that will not stop. It’s just fake news,” said Gorka.

Cooper attempted to deflect the comments, saying,”I’m just going to ignore the insults because I don’t think that really gets us anywhere.”

Cooper reacted when Gorka brought up CNN’s correction of their James Comey story in June. CNN originally reported that the former FBI director was going to contradict Trump’s version of events during his senate testimony. Comey’s statements did not contradict Trump and CNN was forced to admit they were mistaken and update the post.

“That reporting was wrong and we corrected ourselves,” said Cooper. “Unlike the White House which has never corrected itself on anything.”

Gorka called the media “the fake news industrial complex,” and asked Cooper how many minutes they had wasted on Russia during the interview.

“Are you a TV producer now,” asked Cooper. “You’re concerned about how many minutes — Do you have somewhere else to go?”

Gorka continued his assault on CNN’s low viewership, saying, “Tucker Carlson get’s 4 million viewers, you barely scratch 800,000.”

“Let’s let the viewers judge, who decided that you are now 13th place in national ratings behind ‘Nick At Nite’ which is at 11,” said Gorka.

Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, was subpoenaed by the committee on Friday after his lawyers said that he would be out of the country on vacation at the time of the hearing, which will explore shortcomings in the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the committee, has been interested in speaking to Simpson about Fusion GPS’s role in two matters: the salacious and uncorroborated Trump dossier, and a lobbying campaign carried out last year against the Magnitsky Act, a law that places sanctions against Russian human rights abusers.

Fusion GPS was hired last June by a supporter of Hillary Clinton’s to investigate Trump’s dealings in Russia. The firm then hired former British spy Christopher Steele to conduct the research.

Simpson was initially scheduled to testify on Wednesday alongside Donald Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort, but the latter two reached a deal with the committee to avoid appearing in public. Instead, they will talk to the committee in a closed session.

Trump Jr. and Manafort were invited by the committee in order to discuss the June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer named Natalia Veselnitskaya.

Trump Jr. had been told that Veselnitskaya would provide derogatory information about Hillary Clinton. During the meeting, she focused on the Magnitsky Act.

Fusion GPS figures into the case because the firm worked alongside Veselnitskaya on an anti-Magnitsky Act lobbying campaign. Fusion’s role was to investigate Bill Browder, a London-based financial manager who is the catalyst behind the Magnitsky Act.

The 2012 bill is named after Browder’s lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky. He died under mysterious circumstances in a Russian prison in 2009 after investigating a money laundering scheme carried out by Russian businessmen.

Last July, Browder filed a complaint with the Justice Department alleging that Simpson, Veselnitskaya, and others involved in the anti-Magnitsky effort, violated FARA, which requires individuals who work for foreign governments to provide details of their activities.

In a letter to Grassley on Friday, Simpson’s lawyers said that they are “profoundly disturbed” by the committee’s request of Simpson.

“We are profoundly disturbed that the scope of the proposed hearing has expanded, due to private and partisan agendas,” wrote Simpson’s lawyers, Joshua Levy and Robert Muse.

They also claimed that the allegations from Browder that Simpson failed to properly register under FARA “are nothing more than an effort to smear him and his firm.”

“In the event of a subpoena, Mr. Simpson will assert applicable privileges, including but not limited to those under the First and Fifth Amendments. We therefore ask that he be excused from appearing,” the letter reads.

Fusion’s lawyers have said that the firm was not aware of the Trump Tower meeting until it was reported in the news earlier this month.

But Trump’s legal team is raising questions about the June 9, 2016, conclave and is suggesting that the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, misrepresented herself.

“We have learned from both our own investigation and public reports that the participants in the meeting misrepresented who they were and who they worked for,” Mark Corallo, a spokesman for President Trump’s legal team, said on Saturday, just after The New York Times reported that the meeting took place.

Corallo pointed out that Veselnitskaya is associated with Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm behind an anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele. Fusion GPS was paid by a Democratic ally of Hillary Clinton’s to conduct the research.

“Specifically, we have learned that the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS, a firm which according to public reports, was retained by Democratic operatives to develop opposition research on the President and which commissioned the phony Steele dossier,” said Corallo.

“These developments raise serious issues as to exactly who authorized and participated in any effort by Russian nationals to influence our election in any manner.”

Just days after that Trump Tower meeting, Steele would compile the first of 17 memos that make up the dossier. The first memo, dated June 20, alleges that the Kremlin has blackmail material on Trump.

Other memos in the uncorroborated dossier allege that the Trump campaign was coordinating with Russian operatives to meddle in the presidential election.

The disclosure of the meeting raised eyebrows on Saturday given the ongoing investigations into possible Trump-Kremlin coordination.

Manafort is also reportedly under federal investigation because of his lobbying work for Kremlin-connected groups, and Kushner’s Russian business ties have reportedly made him a person of interest in other federal probes.

According to The Times, Kushner disclosed the Trump Tower meeting in a revised filing for his security clearance, and Manafort reportedly told congressional investigators about the encounter. Trump Jr. also confirmed the meeting to The Times.

“It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up,” Trump Jr. said.

President Trump did not attend the meeting and learned of it last week, The Daily Caller was told.

Trump Jr. said that he set up the meeting after being contacted by an unidentified acquaintance. Veselnitskaya attended with a translator, Circa reported on Saturday.

While Russia’s policy on Americans adopting Russian children was ostensibly the topic of the meeting, Veselnitskaya was more interested in discussing an issue tangentially related to adoption: U.S. sanctions against Russian businessmen.

Veselnitskaya is affiliated with the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation (HRAGIF), a benign-sounding non-profit group registered in Delaware. But it has been revealed that the organization is actually interested in rolling back the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law which imposed sanctions against Russian businessmen involved in international criminal activity.

Adoption enters the picture because Russian president Vladimir Putin responded to passage of the law by prohibiting Americans from adopting Russian children.

HRAGIF mounted a lobbying campaign last year to roll back the Magnitsky Act, which is named after Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died in prison in 2009 under mysterious circumstances.

Magnitsky was working at the time for Bill Browder, a U.S.-born businessman who says his companies were defrauded by Putin-linked oligarchs.

Since Magnitsky’s death, Browder has lobbied U.S. lawmakers to pass a law that makes it easier to impose sanctions against Russian businessmen involved in human rights abuses.

In addition to helping start HRAGIF, Veselnitskaya is also a lawyer for Prevezon Holdings, a Cyprus-based company owned by a Russian named Denis Katsyv.

At the time of the meeting, Prevezon was under federal investigation for its involvement in a $230 million tax-fraud scheme uncovered by Magnitsky. The case was settled in May after Prevezon was forced to pay $6 million.

Another HRAGIF affiliate is Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Russian spy and Washington, D.C.-based consultant. Akhmetshin directly lobbied members of Congress on the adoption-sanctions issue last year.

The Daily Beast and Politico reported on Akhmetshin’s work last year.

The Daily Caller reported in January, after the Steele dossier was published by BuzzFeed, that Fusion GPS was involved in the anti-Magnitsky push. The firm was hired last year by BakerHostetler, a white shoe law firm that was also working for Prevezon. (RELATED: Oppo Researcher Behind Trump Dossier Is Linked To Pro-Kremlin Lobbying Effort)

Browder has claimed that Fusion GPS sought to smear him as part of an effort to undercut the Magnitsky Act.

Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley has raised questions about Fusion GPS’s involvement in the anti-Magnitsky matter. He has said he is concerned about Fusion’s links to Democrats given that the FBI relied on the dossier for part of its investigation into potential Trump-Russia collusion.

But the documents do not appear to be what the committee was hoping that Fusion GPS and its founder, Glenn Simpson, would provide.

“The committee is reviewing the production received late this afternoon from Mr. Simpson, but virtually all of the documents appear to be merely news clippings rather than records of Fusion’s substantive communications,” George Hartmann, a spokesman for the Senate Judiciary Committee, told TheDC.

The paltry document production escalates the standoff between Fusion GPS and the Judiciary Committee, which is chaired by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley.

After Simpson declined an invitation to testify before the committee last month, Grassley issued a subpoena to compel him to appear. But the subpoena was withdrawn after Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, said he would voluntarily meet in a closed session with committee staff.

A date for that meeting has not been set.

Last month, the committee requested records from Fusion GPS, the Trump campaign, Donald Trump Jr. and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in the election.

The Trump campaign gave the committee 20,000 pages of records last week while Trump Jr. and Manafort produced 250 pages and 400 pages of records, respectively.

The committee is one of three congressional panels investigating Russia-related matters, including the dossier and the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting held between Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney linked to Fusion GPS.

In its request to Fusion, the Judiciary Committee asked for contracts that the firm signed for its work on the dossier.

Fusion was initially hired to investigate Trump in Sept. 2015 by an unidentified Republican donor who opposed the real estate mogul. After Trump ascended to the GOP nomination, the donor dropped the project. But Fusion soon found a Democratic ally of Hillary Clinton’s — also still unidentified — to continue the research. Fusion hired Christopher Steele, a former MI6 agent, to conduct the investigation.

Fusion and Steele’s firm, Orbis Business Intelligence, have worked together on various projects since 2010.

The committee also asked Fusion to produce contracts and communications regarding its work against the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law opposed by the Russian government.

Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who attended the Trump Tower meeting, was involved in the same lobbying campaign. Veselnitskaya represents Denis Katsyv, the chairman of Prevezon Holdings.

Fusion GPS was working for BakerHostetler, a law firm that was also representing Katsyv and Prevezon.

Veselnitskaya was accompanied to the Trump Tower meeting by Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet military officer who works in the same line of business as Fusion GPS, providing political and business research for shadowy clients.

The Judiciary Committee is also inquiring whether Fusion and Akhmetshin have done business together in the past.

The strange overlap between Fusion GPS, the dossier, and the Trump Tower meeting has piqued Grassley’s interest. He has sought to find out who exactly was paying Fusion GPS for all of its projects.

Grassley is interested in the dossier because of its importance to the FBI’s collusion investigation.

The bureau has reportedly used information from the dossier as part of the basis for its probe. The dossier was reportedly used to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrant against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Page, an energy consultant, is named in the dossier as one of the Trump campaign’s liaisons to the Kremlin. Page has dismissed the claims. He refers to Steele’s document as “the dodgy dossier.”

Grassley has also questioned the FBI over whether it paid Steele to investigate Trump. FBI agents reportedly made an informal agreement with Steele in October to pay the former spy $50,000 to continue his investigation. That payment was reportedly never made.

But the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, calls the allegation, made recently by Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman, “a monstrous lie.”

“I have no idea who Seth is, and how I can have anything to do with this,” she wrote on Facebook when asked about the claim.

Burkman, a part-time radio host who is investigating Rich’s unsolved murder, claimed in a recent interview that an unnamed DNC staffer told him that Rich passed stolen emails to Veselnitskaya.

“This is a very scared source so we had to talk them along and it took a while. We’ve confirmed the source and their identity and who they are,” Burkman told RadarOnline, an online gossip site which openly advertises that it pays for stories.

While Burkman has been dismissed by the mainstream press as a conspiracy theorist, he at one point had the blessing of Rich’s family to carry out an independent investigation of the murder. The 51-year-old lobbyist has also offered $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of Rich’s killer.

Rich was fatally shot in the early morning hours of July 10, 2016 during what police say was a botched robbery attempt. The conspiracy theories came 12 days later, after WikiLeaks released nearly 20,000 emails that were stolen from the DNC.

Burkman’s investigation of Rich’s murder is separate from one conducted by Rod Wheeler, a former Washington, D.C. homicide detective and Fox News contributor.

Wheeler was working with Ed Butowsky, a wealthy GOP donor, to investigate Rich’s death. Their alleged findings, which included a claim that FBI documents tied Rich to Wikileaks, were reported by Fox News and given a platform by conservatives like Sean Hannity and Newt Gingrich.

The two freelance investigators — Wheeler and Burkman — reached different conclusions about who may have killed Rich.

Wheeler and Butowsky developed the theory that Rich provided the DNC emails to WikiLeaks. According to Wheeler in a lawsuit filed against Butowsky and Fox News on Monday, the theory was intended to discredit the idea that the Russian government hacked the DNC.

But as Wheeler noted in his lawsuit, that theory is at odds with the one Burkman is pushing.

Whatever the theory, there is no evidence at all that Rich was involved in the theft of the DNC documents. But that hasn’t stopped Burkman from latching onto the Trump Tower meeting to float a new conspiracy claim.

“We don’t know what the Russian lawyer eventually took to Trump Jr. but what I have is a very credible source saying emails were given to her,” Burkman told RadarOnline of Veselnitskaya. “Whether she gave them to Trump, Jr., I don’t know, but I can’t imagine that she wouldn’t offer.”

Veselnitskaya, who practices law in Moscow, met with Trump Jr. and other Trump campaign officials at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016. Trump Jr. agreed to the meeting after an acquaintance said that a “Russian government attorney” would be providing opposition research on Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.

Veselnitskaya has said that she sought to lobby the Trump campaign on the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law that imposes sanctions on Russian businessmen accused of human rights abuses. One of Veselnitskaya’s clients faces sanctions under the law.

One of Veselnitskaya’s companions in the meeting is Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist who is suspected by some U.S. officials of having ties to Russian intelligence. Veselnitskaya, too, is connected to Russia’s prosecutor general, Yury Chaika. Chaika is also interested in rolling back the Magnitsky Act.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly investigating the Trump Tower meeting, likely to determine whether it amounts to collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. While the Trump team has asserted that the meeting did not constitute collusion, some counterintelligence experts have claimed that Veselnitskaya’s approach could have been a Kremlin-coordinated test run to see if the Trump campaign would be willing to collude in the future.

But Burkman is the first to make the shocking claim that Veselnitskaya promised to pass DNC emails to the Trump campaign. According to various news reports, the information that Veselnitskaya was offering had to do with campaign donations made to Democrats by supporters of the Magnitsky Act.

Veselnitskaya denied Burkman’s claims on her Facebook page, which is open to the public. After initially dismissing the story, she denied knowing Rich or having anything to do with the DNC emails.

“Did he give you the emails?” one Facebook user asked.

“Are you sick or are you pretending?” Veselnitskaya responded.

Pressed again, the lawyer denied Burkman’s allegation.

“Don’t let yourself be manipulated. It’s just a monstrous lie,” she wrote, adding in another comment: “I don’t answer stupid questions.”

Reached by email, Burkman said that he is standing by his source’s claim about Rich and Veselnitskaya.

Glenn Simpson, who heads Fusion GPS, was listed on the website for the International Assessment and Strategy Center (IASC) as recently as this weekend. He joined the Virginia-based think tank in 2009, at around the same time he quit as a reporter at The Wall Street Journal to start his own private intelligence firm. (RELATED: Oppo Researcher Behind Trump Dossier Is Linked To Pro-Kremlin Smear Campaign)

Simpson was listed on the IASC website as a senior fellow for corruption and transnational crime and penned several essays during his time with the organization. It is unclear if Simpson has completely left the think tank or why his biography was removed. Emails and phone calls seeking comment from IASC were not returned.

The low-profile Simpson rocketed into international news last week when The Wall Street Journal reported that Fusion GPS was the firm that hired former British MI6 agent Christopher Steele to dig up dirt about Trump’s activities in Russia. The former spook, who runs a intelligence company of his own called Orbis Business Intelligence in London, produced 35 pages of memos based on information he gleaned from his former colleagues in Russia’s spy agencies.

The dossier, which was published by BuzzFeed last week, contains unverified information that the Russian government is allegedly using blackmail material, or kompromot, against Trump to keep him in step with the Kremlin.

Trump has said he wants to work with Russian president Vladimir Putin, and he has been reluctant to attribute last year’s cyber attacks against the Democratic Party to Russian spies. But the president-elect has denied that the information contained in Steele’s dossier is accurate.

Steele’s sources told him that Russian spies have video showing Trump with prostitutes in a Russian hotel room. They also said that members of his campaign staff met with Russian agents to discuss information that would help Trump in the election.

U.S. intelligence officials have said they do not know if the information is accurate or inaccurate. No evidence has been made public to support the claims, and other assertions in the dossier — such as that Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, met with a Russian operative in Prague last year — have been debunked.

Fusion GPS embarked on the project in Sept. 2015 after being hired by an unidentified Republican donor. But as the real estate billionaire inched closer to the GOP nomination, the donor exited the project. Fusion GPS found another client in the form of a pro-Hillary Clinton Democratic backer.

That’s when Steele was hired to continue the research on Trump. The story goes that Steele became so concerned about the information he was uncovering that he turned his memos over to the FBI and British intelligence services.

The memos, which are now being referred to as a dossier, were shopped to various Washington, D.C. reporters both before the election and after. They also made their way around Western intelligence agencies. Even Arizona Sen. John McCain got in on the action. He was passed a copy of the memos last month and handed them over to FBI director Jim Comey.

McCain has said he did not know whether the dossier was accurate but wanted to pass them along to Comey out of an abundance of caution.

News outlets declined to publish the documents because the claims in them were impossible to prove. But that changed when BuzzFeed published them online last Tuesday. That controversial decision came after CNN reported that Trump and President Obama had been briefed the week before on a two-page summary of Steele’s memos.

Comey personally briefed Trump that the information was circulating. And Vice President Joe Biden said last week that intelligence officials briefed him and Obama on the summary because they expected information about the dossier to leak soon.

The revelation that Simpson was involved in compiling the dossier has led some to further question its veracity.

While the snoop conducted an investigation of what would appear to cast a negative light on the Kremlin, Simpson has done other work that is favorable for the Russian government.

Last week, The Daily Caller exclusively reported that Simpson was recently involved in a campaign to undermine the Magnitsky Act, a law passed by Congress in 2012 that is vehemently opposed by Putin and Russia’s Kremlin-connected oligarchs.

Fusion GPS was hired last year by the law firm BakerHostetler, which was representing a Russian businessman named Denis Katsyv.

Katsyv’s Cyprus-based company, Prevezon, is currently being investigated by a federal grand jury for laundering $230 million. The Magnitsky Act is named for Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who exposed the alleged Prevezon fraud and was allegedly beaten to death in a Russian prison as payback in 2009. The Justice Department has frozen $14 million of Prevezon assets.

According to Bill Browder, a former Putin ally who hired Magnitsky and lobbies U.S. Congress on the Magnitsky Act, part of Simpson’s work involved passing stories to his deep network of journalism contacts in order to undermine the law, which places visa restrictions and asset freezes on Russian human rights abusers.

Browder alleged in an interview with TheDC that Simpson is a “professional smear campaigner.” He has also been called a hired gun.

Simpson’s work at IASC, in light of his work on the Magnitsky Act, would seem to support that characterization.

While the think tank has scrubbed Simpson’s bio from its site, his writings remain online.

One of Simpson’s essays at IASC, the think tank, “U.S. Identifies Russian ‘Nexus’ Of Organized Crime.”

“After two years of research, the U.S. intelligence community has formally concluded that the governments of Russia and other Eurasian states actively collaborate with organized crime groups,” the piece begins.

In the Feb. 10, 2010 essay, Simpson explores a subtle shift in U.S. foreign policy undertaken by Dennis Blair, the director of national intelligence at the time.

In Senate testimony that month, Blair offered up an assessment of an emerging problem — the “apparent growing nexus in Russian and Eurasian states among government, organized crime, intelligence services, and big business figures.”

Simpson went on to assert that the threat posed by the Kremlin-Russian mafia nexus “is not as easily grasped as terrorism.”

“It is more insidious, weaving criminal interests into business relationships throughout a globalized economy, often in strategic industries like energy and finance,” he wrote.

While the committee has not yet announced the exact date, Trump Jr. will appear in “the next few weeks,” a source familiar with the matter told Politico. Trump Jr. was called to publicly testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in July but countered by offering to be interviewed privately and provide documents to the committee.

The committee’s leaders, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California and GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, vowed in July to compel Trump Jr. and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to appear in a public hearing under threat of a subpoena, if necessary. The pair agreed, however, to allow Trump Jr. and Manafort to appear privately ahead of any public hearing.

Trump Jr.’s June 2016 meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya raised questions for the three separate congressional committees investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election after The New York Times revealed the meeting was sold to Trump Jr. as an opportunity to obtain damaging information related to the Clinton campaign. Emails released by Trump Jr., in which he responded “if it’s what you say I love it,” to publicist Rob Goldstone’s offer of opposition research against Clinton, corroborated the NYTimes report.

Manafort and White House adviser Jared Kushner, both of whom were present at the June 2016 meeting, have provided congressional testimony, but Trump Jr. has not yet appeared on the Hill in an official capacity.

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s Justice Department probe into Russian meddling was reportedly consulted regarding Trump Jr.’s appearance in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and did not object.

Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya originally entered the country in October 2015 on a grant of immigration parole, a rare exemption which allowed her to enter the country without a visa and remain legally until early January 2016, according to court records obtained by The Hill.

Court records from a hearing that took place during the first week of January show Veselnitskaya was granted a week extension on her stay while her case was deliberated, but there are no further records related to her case. It remains unclear how she was able to remain in the country until June 2016 when she met with Donald Trump Jr.

Veselnitskaya gained an audience with Trump Jr. on June 9, 2016, after an intermediary told him she had damaging information related to Russian support for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Five days later, the Russian lawyer was seated in the front row of a House Foreign Affairs Committee meeting on Russia policy.

During her June stay in Washington, D.C., Veselnitskaya also attended a screening of a pro-Russian film at the Newseum, which five congressional staffers and State Department officials also attended. The film focused on criticizing the Magnitsky Act, which imposes financial and travel sanctions on Russian officials connected to the 2009 murder of Sergei Magnitsky, who was killed in prison after uncovering an alleged $230 million tax fraud perpetrated by corrupt Russian government officials.

Veselnitskaya’s lobbying campaign continued at a dinner she attended with the chairman of the House subcommittee overseeing Russia policy, Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of California, and roughly 20 other guests.

“There was a dinner at the Capitol Hill Club here with about 20 people. I think I was the only congressman there. They were talking about the Magnitsky case. But that wasn’t just the topic. There was a lot of other things going on,” Rohrabacher told The Hill. “So I think she was there but I don’t remember any type of conversation with her between us. But I understand she was at the table.”

Rohrabacher said he understood Veselnitskaya and former Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums of California attended the dinner to lobby against the Magnitsky Act. (RELATED: Russian Lawyer Has Ties To Firm That Compiled Trump Dossier)

Veselnitskaya’s Washington lobbying campaign deviated significantly from the reason she was originally allowed into the country. After initially being denied a visa, she obtained an immigration parol from former Attorney General Loretta Lynch to allow her to defend her client, Prevezon, a Russian holding company on trial in New York for money laundering. (RELATED: Senate Panel To Hear Testimony From Businessman Targeted By Trump Dossier Firm)

During the January hearing, in which Veselnitskaya requested an extension of her immigration parole, federal prosecutors described how rare the exemption she had been granted in October really was.

“In October the government bypassed the normal visa process and gave a type of extraordinary permission to enter the country called immigration parole,” assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Monteleoni explained to the judge during the January 6 hearing.

“That’s a discretionary act that the statute allows the attorney general to do in extraordinary circumstances. In this case, we did that so that Mr. Katsyv could testify. And we made the further accommodation of allowing his Russian lawyer into the country to assist,” he added, referring to Prevezon’s owner.

The pre-dawn raid was carried out on July 26, a day after Manafort met voluntarily with staff on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is running a parallel investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Manafort, confirmed that Manafort was served a search warrant.

“FBI agents executed a search warrant at one of Mr. Manafort’s residences. Mr. Manafort has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well,” he said in a statement to The Daily Caller.

The search warrant was requested by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating potential campaign collusion as well as the business activities of various Trumpworld figures, including Manafort and former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.

According to The Post, the search warrant was issued after Mueller’s investigators argued that they were not confident that Manafort would turn over all records in response to grand jury subpoenas that have been issued in the investigation.

FBI agents left Manafort’s home with various records, some of which he had already provided to Congress, according to the Post.

Manafort, who left the Trump campaign in August, has given documents to both the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee. Among the documents are notes he is said to have taken during a June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer believed to have ties to the Kremlin.

Trump Jr. took the meeting after being promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

Mueller’s increased focus on Manafort in recent weeks is being interpreted by some as an attempt to get the longtime Republican operative to flip on Trump.

Trump Jr. denied being aware of Veselnitskaya’s identity or her possible connections to the Kremlin prior to the meeting, but he later published emails that show he was told beforehand that the information he sought was part of the Russian government’s plan to help his father defeat Hillary Clinton.

The emails, which were released on Twitter, show that Trump Jr. was told that the information came from the Russian government. He was also informed by his acquaintance, a music publicist named Rob Goldstone, that the Russian government supported the Trump campaign.

“This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump — helped along by Aras and Emin,” wrote Goldstone, referring to his client Emin Agalarov, a musician popular in Russia.

Aras Agalarov, Emin’s father, is a Russian billionaire close to Vladimir Putin. He partnered with the elder Trump on Miss Universe 2013, which was held in Moscow.

The email exchange shows that Trump Jr. was receptive to receiving damaging information about Clinton. It also shows that he was told that the information was coming from people affiliated with the Russian government.

“Emin asked that I schedule the meeting with you and The Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday,” Goldstone wrote to Trump Jr. on June 7.

That attorney is Natalia Veselnitskaya. As The New York Times reported over the weekend, Veselnitskaya met with Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul Manafort on June 9, 2016.

Trump Jr. initially said that Veselnitskaya wanted to discuss U.S. adoptions of Russian children. Russian president Vladimir Putin enacted a ban against the adoptions after the 2012 passage of the Magnitsky Act, a law that allows for sanctions against Russians accused of human rights abuses.

Veselnitskaya is a lawyer for a Russian businessman who wants to see the Magnitsky Act curtailed. She has worked with a former Soviet spy named Rinat Akhmetshin on the anti-Magnitsky effort.

Veselnitskaya did not provide any information about Clinton, both she and Trump Jr. have said publicly.

But Trump critics have asserted that the meeting is evidence of potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government. The possibility of campaign collusion is currently being investigated by the FBI, Special Counsel Robert Mueller and several congressional panels.

“To everyone, in order to be totally transparent, I am releasing the entire email chain of my emails with Rob Goldstone about the meeting on June 9, 2016,” Trump Jr. wrote in a statement on Twitter.

The email chain begins on June 3, 2016, the week before the meeting was held in Trump Tower.

“Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting,” Goldstone wrote in the first salvo of the email thread.

“The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very helpful to your father.”

There is no “Crown prosecutor of Russia,” suggesting that Goldstone was joking about Emin Agalarov.

Goldstone then asked Trump what would be the best way to handle the information. He asked if Trump would prefer to speak to Agalarov. He then said he could send the information director to the elder Trump through his secretary.

“But it is ultra sensitive and I wanted to send to you first,” wrote Goldstone.

Trump Jr. responded by saying that he was on the road and preferred to speak to Emin Agalarov first. But he made it clear that he was interested in the information about Clinton.

“If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer,” he wrote, suggesting that he thought it would be a good idea to release damaging information about Clinton later in the campaign season.

The pair exchanged several other emails before pushing the meeting back to June 9.

On June 8, Trump emailed Kushner and Manafort giving them a heads up that the meeting had been rescheduled.

That email’s subject line reads: “Russia – Clinton – private and confidential.”

Notably, it appears that Trump Jr. forwarded Kushner and Manafort the entire email thread he had with Goldstone.

It is still unclear how The Times learned of the email exchanges between Trump Jr. and Goldstone. The newspapers’ report on the email exchanges was sourced to “three people” familiar with the exchanges.

In his statement Tuesday, Trump Jr. said that Veselnitskaya “was not a government official.”

And, as we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act.”

“To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue.”

“The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was Political Opposition Research. I first wanted to just have a phone call but when that didn’t work out, they said the woman would be in New York and asked if I would meet,” he added.

Trump Jr., along with former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and senior adviser Jared Kushner, met with the lawyer in the hopes of gaining opposition research. Email communications between Trump Jr. and Rob Goldstone–who set up the meeting–revealed that Trump Jr. was told the information involved was obtained by the Russian government.

Trump Jr. initially claimed that he didn’t know the lawyer or the information could be connected to the Russian government.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News’ Hannity Tuesday night, Trump Jr. partially blamed his “learning curve” when it comes to politics for the way he chose to handle the meeting request. Nevertheless, he claimed he would’ve turned “shady” information over to the authorities.

“This is the first time we’ve ever done any of this,” Trump Jr. said. “I’m still way in the learning curve on all of this.”

“That’s what we do in business–if there’s information out there you want it,” he continued. “If there was something that came from it that was shady, if it was a danger to national security, I would obviously bring it right to someone.”

“Turns out there wasn’t anything,” he concluded.

In an interview with RT, Russia’s state-owned news outlet, Natalia Veselnitskaya, the attorney, accused a London-based financier named Bill Browder of being behind the “mass hysteria” surrounding the June 9, 2016 meeting.

Veselnitskaya claims that she attended the meeting in order to lobby the Trump campaign against the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 sanctions law championed by Browder.

But the meeting was set up after Donald Trump Jr. was offered derogatory information about Hillary Clinton from an acquaintance. Trump Jr. was told that a “Russian government attorney” would be providing the information.

Trump Jr. eagerly accepted the offer, even after being told that the information was being provided as part of the Russian government’s support for the Trump campaign. Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort attended the meeting on the Trump campaign side, and Veselnitskaya was accompanied by several Russians, including a Russian-American lobbyist who some believe is linked to Russia’s intelligence apparatus.

While Veselnitskaya has acknowledged in previous interviews that she discussed Clinton during the meeting, she has fixed her attention on Browder, whom she often berates on her various social media accounts.

Veselnitskaya says that she would be willing to testify before the Senate in order to discuss both the Trump Tower meeting and Browder.

“If the Senate wishes to hear the real story, I will be happy to speak up and share everything I wanted to tell Mr. Trump,” she said of Browder, the CEO of Hermitage Capital.

Veselnitskaya claims that Browder has fabricated details of the death of Sergei Magnitsky, his former attorney and the namesake for the Magnitsky Act.

Browder has claimed that Magnitsky was tortured and murdered in a Russian prison in 2009 after being jailed for investigating a $230 million money laundering scheme against his company.

Veselnitskaya claims that Browder is who committed financial fraud in the case and has crafted a legend surrounding Magnitsky in order to cover it up.

In order to discredit Browder, Veselnitskaya worked last year with Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that is also behind the infamous dossier of research accusing President Trump of colluding with Russia during the presidential campaign.

Veselnitskaya may soon get to talk to Congress. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said over the weekend that he wants to talk to all eight of the participants in the Trump Tower meeting.

The New York Times reports that the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, promised to provide Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., with information about Russian political donations to Clinton’s campaign.

Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman at the time, and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a senior White House adviser, took part in the June 9, 2016 session, which was held at Trump Tower in New York City.

Trump Jr. and Kushner acknowledged on Saturday that the meeting took place. But in his first statement on the matter, Trump Jr. did not mention that Veselnitskaya promised information about Clinton.

Instead, he said that the lawyer asked for the meeting in order to discuss Russia’s policy regarding U.S. citizens adopting Russian children.

Veselnitskaya likely had ulterior motives for seeking the meeting. She is part of a group of Russian operatives who have used the child adoption issue as leverage to force the U.S. to roll back the Magnitsky Act, a law passed in 2012 which allows for sanctions against Russian businessmen involved in human rights abuses.

After that law was passed, Russian president Vladimir Putin retaliated by barring American citizens from adopting Russian children.

In a statement to The Times on Sunday, Trump Jr. acknowledged that Veselnitksaya discussed having damaging information about Clinton. But he said that she soon switched the conversation to Russian adoptions and the Magnitsky Act.

“After pleasantries were exchanged the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton,” Trump Jr. told the newspaper.

“Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.”

Trump Jr. has said he was asked to host the meeting by an acquaintance. That person has yet to be identified.

Kushner recently disclosed the existence of the meeting in a revising filing to obtain his security clearance. Manafort, who left Trump’s campaign in August, also reportedly told congressional investigators about the meeting. (RELATED: Opposition Researcher Behind Trump Dossier Linked To Pro-Kremlin Lobbying Effort)

The meeting is already drawing significant media attention, largely because it shows that the Trump team was willing to meet with Russians to discuss the presidential campaign. While political campaigns often meet with people promising dirt on political rivals, the fact that Veselnitskaya is linked to the Kremlin bears significance because of the multiple investigations into whether members of the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government to influence the election.

President Trump’s legal team suggested on Saturday that Veselnitskaya may have been attempting to compromise the Trump campaign by requesting the meeting.

Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the legal team, noted on Saturday that Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm behind the anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, also worked on the anti-Magnitsky push.

Fusion GPS was hired by the law firm BakerHostetler to conduct research on Bill Browder, an American born businessman who lobbied Congress to pass the Magnitsky Act. Browder was the boss of the law’s namesake, Sergei Magnitsky. Browder had hired Magnitsky to investigate. Magnitsky died in a Russian prison in 2009 under suspicious circumstances.

Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin were also involved with BakerHostetler.

In order to push against the Magnitsky Act, Veselnitskaya co-founded a U.S.-based non-profit group last year that ostensibly worked on the adoption cause.

The organization, the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, hired a former Soviet spy named Rinat Akhmetshin to conduct the lobbying effort.

Veselnitskaya is also a lawyer for Denis Katsyv, the owner of Prevezon Holdings, a Cyprus-based investment company that was under U.S. investigation for money laundering.

It was recently revealed that Trump Jr. had met with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer, on June 9, 2016 because she had promised him that she had damaging information that might hurt Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.

Trump Jr. admitted that he sought the information, but claimed he did not know that the person he was meeting had connections to the Russian government prior to the meeting.

“I was asked to have a meeting by an acquaintance I knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant with an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign,” Trump Jr. said. “I was not told her name prior to the meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to attend, but told them nothing of the substance.”

However, it is now being reported that Trump Jr. was told in an email before arranging the meeting that the Russian government was behind the damaging information, according to three NYT sources with knowledge of the email.

The email was allegedly sent by Rob Goldstone, a British reporter who helped Trump Jr. arrange the meeting back in June. According to the three sources, the email indicates that the damaging Clinton information came from the Russian government but does not indicate if they procured the information from the Democratic National Committee hack.

“Obviously I’m the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent… went nowhere but had to listen,” Trump Jr. previously wrote in one tweet about the meeting.

“No inconsistency in statements, meeting ended up being primarily about adoptions,” he said in another tweet, backing up claims he had made that his meeting with Veselnitskaya centered on Russian adoptions. “In response to further Q’s I simply provided more details.”

Goldstone, who allegedly wrote the email to Trump Jr., also denied knowing if the Russian government had anything to do with the information. Interestingly, one of NYT’s sources said it appeared that Goldstone was simply passing along information he had been given by others.

Further attempts by the NYT to reach Goldstone were unsuccessful, leaving questions as to how Goldstone would have authored an email without fully reading or understanding its contents.

The former adviser, who still keeps in touch with Trump and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said a Politico reporter called him in Fall 2015 to ask whether he had ever heard that Trump had an orgy in Russia. The former adviser said he asked the reporter “who told him this” and the reporter said no one, and that he got the information from a document made by Fusion GPS that was floating around.

The New York Times reported Wednesday that a wealthy Republican donor had paid Fusion GPS in September 2015 to create an opposition research file on Trump. This resulted in former British spy Christopher Steele’s dossier which contains unverified claims of deep-ties between the Kremlin and Trump. The dossier that was released by BuzzFeed is dated from June to December 2016, the former adviser said that this is probably the result of an updated document.

He pointed to the dossier including the claim that Michael Cohen met with Russian officials in Prague last August. This allegation has been disputed by an Atlantic report which says Cohen was at a baseball game with his son at the University of Southern California at the time.

The former adviser said he told the Politico reporter at the time that “by chance” he knows the orgy claim is not true. He said that when Trump visited Moscow in 2013, Russian pop star Emin Agalarov told Trump’s head of security Keith Schiller that he was going to send up prostitutes to Trump’s room.

Schiller shot down the plan, and they put people outside of Trump’s hotel room to make sure nothing happened, according to the former adviser. Emin’s management did not return a request for comment.

While Trump was in Moscow he made a cameo in one of Emin’s music videos.

The former adviser said that Trump’s comments during a press conference Wednesday that you have to be careful when traveling weren’t facetious. He said, “Trump has always been like remember they’re taping you, be very careful.”

The former adviser went on to say that he was also approached by someone from the Jeb Bush campaign about the memos in December 2015. It has been reported that the dossier freely floated around Washington as several outlets have claimed to have seen it months prior to BuzzFeed publishing it in its entirety.

“Ben Smith is openly hostile and biased towards Trump,” the former adviser said about the site’s editor-in-chief.

Last summer BuzzFeed turned down a million dollar advertisement deal with the Republican National Committee because Trump hurt the feelings of the site’s employees."

According to a partial write-up of the interview by Fox News, Trump Jr. told Hannity, “in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently.”

A recent report revealed that Trump Jr. had met with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 hoping to obtain information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. He claimed that nothing came of the meeting and that he didn’t know beforehand that the information he sought — or the person he was meeting with — could be connected to the Kremlin.

However, as email exchanges released on Trump Jr.’s Twitter account show, he was told at least once by Rob Goldstone, who set up the meeting, that the information was part of an effort by the Russian government to aid his father’s campaign.

“This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,” read a piece of a June 3, 2016 email from Goldstone to Trump Jr.

Trump Jr. still contends in his interview with Hannity that the meeting was “nothing” and that “I wouldn’t have even remembered it until you started scouring through this stuff. It was literally just a wasted 20 minutes, which was a shame.”

“I didn’t know if there was any credibility, I didn’t know if there was anything behind it, I can’t vouch for the information,” Trump Jr. continued. “Someone sent me an email. I can’t help what someone sends me. I read it, I responded accordingly.”

Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager at the time, and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, were also present at the meeting with the lawyer.

The full interview with Hannity, which airs at 10 PM EDT, is Trump Jr.’s first interview since he released the email exchanges with Goldstone.

The predictable claims that the emails are a “smoking gun” proving collusion and that such activity amounted to “treason” followed. But what the emails actually reveal is nothing of the sort. Instead, the emails depict what amounted to a really bad game of telephone (the email version, of course) and a rather ludicrous scenario onto which Democrats are latching as “proof” of “collusion.”

From the emails, and subsequent interviews, seven key figures emerge: (1) Yuri Yakovlevich Chaika, described in the emails as the “Crown prosecutor” of Russia, but, since Russia is not a monarchy, his official title is “prosecutor general”; (2) Aras Agalarov, a Russian real estate developer that licensed the then-Trump owned Miss Universe pageant in 2013; (3) Emin Agalarov, son of Aras Agalarov and Russian pop music star; (4) Rob Goldstone, a music publicist and former tabloid journalists; (5) Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer that attended the meeting at Trump Tower; (6) an unnamed person that Veselnitskaya said helped arrange the meeting on her end; and (7) Donald Trump Jr., son of President Trump and the person with whom Veselnitskaya met at Trump Tower.

With this cast of characters, here is how everything allegedly went down:

Chaika relayed the existence of the documents during a meeting to the elder Agalarov; Aras then told his son Emin, who then relayed that information to Goldstone, who proceeded to pass the information along to Don Jr., who said he would be willing to speak with Emin over the phone about the documents, but Emin told Goldstone to arrange a meeting between Don Jr. and Veselnitskaya, who Goldstone told The New York Times that Emin told him “has information about illegal campaign contributions to the D.N.C.,” so an unnamed associate of Veselnitskaya and Goldstone got into contact to arrange the meeting, but Veselnitskaya didn’t have any incriminating information and, according to Don Jr., instead merely made “vague” and “ambiguous” statements that “made no sense” and lacked “details or supporting information” after which she changed the subject to a now ceased adoption program that facilitated the American adoption of Russian children.

Got that?

Great.

Here’s why this whole ordeal calls into question the veracity of any allegation of actual “collusion.”

First, when “collusion” between the Trump campaign and Russia was originally discussed it had always been within the context of the Trump campaign assisting the Russians with hacking the DNC. But with these emails, that theory immediately falls apart. As I wrote on Monday, the DNC knew in May that Russia hacked its network. Don Jr. met with the Russian lawyer in June, the month after the hack—meaning that Don Jr. could not collude to do something that had already happened.

Second, speaking of the timeline, it is important to remember that this meeting occurred before the DNC publicly disclosed that Russian hackers penetrated their computer network and stole a trove of their emails. Don Jr. met with the Russian lawyer on June 9th. The DNC publicly disclosed the Russian hack five days later on June 14th. So meeting with a Russian national then would not have evoked the same type of hysterical response that it does now, nor would such a meeting necessarily carry the treasonous connotation it does today.

Third, if this were really a meeting with a high-level Russian official, then that official would already know that they (the Russian government) stole emails from the DNC. So the fact that emails were admittedly not discussed strongly suggests that the lawyer was not actually an official of the Russian government. Or, if she was, then she was not a high-level official. Veselnitskaya told NBC News that she is not connected at all to the Russian government.

Fourth, the most cited portion of the email chain is really Goldstone editorializing about what he thinks is the significance of the information. In the introductory email, after explaining that Russia’s prosecutor general told Aras Agalarov about the alleged existence of “incriminating” information about Clinton, Goldstone says, “This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump – helped along by Aras and Emin.” But wait, what about the mere existence of “incriminating” information implies that the information is also “obviously” high level and sensitive? Even if, as Goldstone says, the information and documents were “official” that still says nothing about the content of the messages, their level, or sensitivity. Indeed, information does not automatically become “high level and sensitive” simply because a government official provided it. If that were the case, then all of the documents we get from filing Freedom of Information Act requests here in the U.S. would be considered “high level and sensitive.” Such a proposition is a little ridiculous.

Fifth, and finally, I thought Russian president Vladimir Putin was supposed to be some kind of KGB spymaster. By that, I mean what kind of apparent spy ring mastermind would risk entrusting his plans for political espionage to a British music publicist and tabloid journalist (Goldstone)? Isn’t that like the last person one would want to know about that kind of stuff? Of all the possible scenarios of collusion, the Democrats have decided that this one seems the most credible?

If somehow this turns out to be true, I think it might say a lot more about Putin than it does about Don Jr."

But information about the meeting — including emails in Kushner’s possession — were eventually leaked to The New York Times, raising questions about whether the Kushner team followed through with their initial plan.

The Washington Post reported details of Kushner’s deliberations on Monday:

Hope Hicks, the White House director of strategic communications and one of the president’s most trusted and loyal aides, and Josh Raffel, a White House spokesman who works closely with Kushner and Ivanka Trump, huddled with Kushner’s lawyers, and they advocated for a more transparent approach, according to people with knowledge of the conversations. In one scenario, these people said, Kushner’s team talked about sharing everything, including the contents of the emails, with a mainstream news organization. (emphasis added)

The biggest revelation in The Post report is that President Trump dictated a statement issued by his son Donald Trump Jr. regarding the June 9, 2016 meeting. In the statement, Trump Jr. said that the meeting, which was attended by Kushner, Paul Manafort, a Russian lawyer and several others, concerned the issue of U.S. adoptions of Russian children.

But it came to light over the next several days that Trump Jr. accepted the meeting after being offered — through email — derogatory information about Hillary Clinton.

Trump Jr. was forced to revise his statement about the meeting by acknowledging that he was offered research on Clinton. He also pre-emptively released emails in which he arranged the meeting — and which he forwarded to Kushner and Manafort — after he was informed that The Times planned to release the documents.

How The Times obtained the emails — as well as how it first caught wind of the Trump Tower meeting story — has remained a mystery.

Speculation has swirled about who would have leaked the documents. Given his and President Trump’s initial misleading statements about the meeting, Trump Jr. and his legal team were not the likely culprits.

Manafort has been floated as the suspected leaker. Federal investigators have also been blamed, though it is not certain that they had possession of the email chain. Kushner has also been suspected, and The Post’s reporting that his team considered leaking raises the odds that he was the leaker.

Raffel, the spokesman for Kushner who discussed the transparency strategy, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

And none of the participants in the conclave — either on the Trump side or the group of Russians who set it up — are identifying that eighth mystery attendee, whose existence was reported two days ago by CNN.

Trump’s legal team still doesn’t know the names of all of the attendees, Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow said on Sunday. That matches what The Daily Caller has been told in recent days by others familiar with the Trump legal team’s activities.

It’s possible that the mystery attendee is of no consequence to the developing story about the Trump Tower tryst. But federal and congressional investigators will surely want to speak to that person either way.

“I would like to hear from all of these individuals,” Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview on CNN on Sunday. “Whether we will be able to get the Russian nationals to come over and testify is an open question. But those people that our committee has jurisdiction over, the Americans, I sure as heck want to talk to all of them.”

Three people on the Trump campaign side of the meeting have been identified so far. Donald Trump Jr. set up the gathering after being told that the campaign would be provided damaging information from a “Russian government attorney” about Hillary Clinton.

Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman at the time, joined the meeting, which was held in Trump Jr.’s office on the 25th floor of Trump Tower.

A music publicist named Rob Goldstone also attended. The 57-year-old Brit is who contacted Trump Jr. about the meeting in the first place. In a June 3, 2016 email to Trump Jr., he said that a “Russian government attorney” wanted to provide the Trump campaign with opposition research on Hillary Clinton.

He relayed the offer from Emin Agalarov, a Russian-Azerbaijani pop singer represented by Gladstone.

“I love it,” Trump Jr. told Gladstone when offered the Clinton dirt.

Natalia Veselnitskaya, the attorney, was at the time representing a Russian businessman who has been accused of laundering money plundered from Russian companies.

Veselnitskaya has lobbied in the U.S. against the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law that punishes Russian human rights abusers.

To conduct that lobbying, she formed a non-profit group called the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation (HRAGIF). Formed last February, that organization hired a former Soviet intelligence officer named Rinat Akhmetshin to lobby lawmakers against Magnitsky. (RELATED: Russian Lawyer Took Translator — A State Department Contractor — To Trump Tower Meeting)

Akhmetshin, who has deep connections among Washington reporters, was also in the Trump Tower meeting, he acknowledged on Friday.

Rounding out the list of known attendees is Anatoli Samochornov, a professional translator who has worked closely with Veselnitakay on the anti-Magnitsky push.

Samochornov, who The Daily Caller first identified on Thursday, worked as a part-time State Department contractor through September. He is also affiliated with HRAGIF.

The identity of the remaining participants has remained a mystery for more than two days, though not for lack of attempts to identify the person, who CNN reported is a representative of the Agalarovs, the Russian-Azerbaijani family who has done business with the Trumps.

Trump Jr. did not respond to emails seeking the name of the mystery man or woman. Nor has his attorney, Alan Furtufas. A spokesman for Manafort did not respond to emails, nor did a spokesman for Kushner.

The Russians aren’t talking either. Veselnitskaya did not answer emails seeking comment. Akhmetshin and Samochornov — after speaking to reporters on Friday — did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls placed over the past several days.

Goldstone has also gone off the grid after having given interviews throughout the week.

It’s not entirely clear which players in the murky story even know the identity of any additional meeting participants. While the Russian side would be most likely to know, it’s not clear that the Trump side has that information. It’s possible that the person is merely a handler for the Agalarov family whose involvement in the meeting would not raise further questions of potential campaign collusion — as did the identification of Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin.

There does appear to be a communication breakdown between President Trump’s legal team and lawyers working his son and son-in-law.

Trump’s legal team has not been made privy to all of the information gathered by lawyers working for his family members, TheDC was told by a source familiar with the situation.

That wall has posed a problem for the Trump team in its attempts to identify all of the attendees. For instance, Trump’s legal team did not learn Veselnitskaya’s name until last Friday, a day before The New York Times identified her.

Trump Jr. released the June email exchange between him and music publicist named Rob Goldstone discussing how the Russian government supported his father.

GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida — who sits on the Senate Intel Committee — said the information will be helpful to the panel’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election, adding they need to hear Trump Jr.’s account of what took place.

“I think that the appropriate next step here is to have him come before the committee because he’s expressed his willingness to get a better context behind all of this, because what we’re focused on is the methods and tactics used my Putin’s Russia to interfere in political processes, any sort of criminal element is being handled by Mueller,” he told reporters.

Rubio said it’s not the Senate Intelligence Committee’s place to determine whether Trump Jr.’s willingness to take the meeting is evidence of collusion., noting that is in the hands of the special prosecutor.

“Well, that is something Mr. Mueller will have to determine, and our job is to issue a report on whether or not how the Russians interfered in our elections and the tactics they used and this very well could be insightful in that regard,” he said. “But we’d like to talk to him and his willingness to talk to us I think is a very positive sign.”

Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said the exchange warrants an investigation of its own, telling reporters she is hoping the chair and vice chair of the committee request any other emails or documents they currently don’t possess.

“The emails deserve their own investigation; I believe that the committee should interview Donald Trump Jr. as well as everyone else who was involved in attending the meeting or setting up the meeting,” she told reporters. “Until we have a fuller picture it would be premature for me to reach any judgment.”

Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri argued the emails violate campaign finance regulations.

“Certainly, I think we have some pretty clear evidence of campaign finance violations at this point, breaking the law as it relates to assistance from foreign governments,” she told reporters. “So I think the investigations in the Senate are going to continue and I know all of this will be of great interest to Robert Mueller in what is final call on what id anything will be referred for criminal prosecution.”

Democrat Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, Senate Intel’s ranking member, said lawmakers need to “reserve judgment” until they receive more information, but funds the Trump administration’s handling of the issue alarming.

“We have heard in the campaign, during the transition, in the administration that there were no contacts with Russians, No discussions about the campaign — all blatantly false,” he said. ” … There are no excuses for what we’ve seen in the last 24 hours.”

Trump Jr. admitted to taking a meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya under the pretense that the lawyer had ammo on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In light of allegations that Trump colluded with Russia to influence the election results, the news of this meeting has seemingly left many feeling unsettled. Or maybe it’s just many in the American media.

The Mirror surveyed people on and around Capitol Hill to find out what people think of Don Jr. and the meeting that has saturated the mainstream media the past week. Many people who looked to be Washington locals — khakis, Polos and such — refused to talk. Two teenage women had no idea who Don Jr. was. Families and tourists were an easier target.

A middle-aged man named Tom was outspoken in his belief that the uproar of news coverage has done nothing but curb the Trump administration’s progress.

“I think the bottom line is people need to let our President and his people do his job,” the Washington state native said. “Right now all the public is doing is putting up roadblocks and what we need is to have the government run the government.”

Tom described it as “kinda crazy” for people to assume this meeting had anything to do with the election results. For Tom, the Don Jr. discussion signifies nothing more than people “getting sidetracked with nonsense.”

“You can assume the worst, assume the best, or be open minded,” Tom added. “Right now people are quick to say Trump has something to hide.”

Sean, an Arizona native, agreed that Russian collusion chatter is just “noise” overshadowing conversations of greater importance that will have a direct impact on American life.

“It is a convenient distraction from the policies for the Trump administration,” Sean said. “The more Donald Jr. pops up on Twitter, the more we aren’t talking about the repeal of the Affordable Care Act or other issues that are sliding by without a second glance.”

“A strategic benefit,” was how Sean ultimately described it.

Despite agreeing the story was “blown out of proportion,” a Maryland-native named Billy argued that Don Jr. was not wrong for meeting with Veselnitskaya.

“If they had something on Hilary it wouldn’t be a bad thing to know about it,” Billy said echoing Trump’s reaction. “Isn’t that what politicians do when they are running for office?”

Billy added that Trump probably knew his son met with the Russian lawyer but denied it to the media because he “knew what a hornets nest it would be to admit the truth.”

Kelly, a young adult from Connecticut, harmoniously agreed that the Don Jr. coverage has been drawn-out. She blamed the media for exaggerating the story and not letting it go.

“Just when the story of Russian collusion is dying down the media finds this to keep the fire alive and give people something to talk about,” Kelly asserted. “It definitely doesn’t look good for the Trump administration and their excuses don’t help, but I feel like this is a typical case of the media embellishing a story for the sake of a story.”

In the face of the snowballing evidence, the President has continued to defend his family name, denying any claims of Russian collusion.

Like Trump, many are tired of the broken-record that has become mainstream media, but whether we will see an end to it anytime soon remains unlikely."

Fusion GPS also stands behind the dossier, a lawyer for the firm said at the end of a 10-hour interview given by co-founder Glenn Simpson.

“Mr. Simpson told Congress the truth and cleared the record on many matters of interest to congressional investigators. He also kept the identities of Fusion GPS’ clients confidential,” Josh Levy, Simpson’s attorney, told The Daily Caller in a statement.

Simpson appeared for the interview after weeks of negotiations between his attorneys and the committee, which is one of three congressional panels investigation potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.

Fusion GPS’ dossier, which was compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, has been a key component in the investigations. The FBI has reportedly relied on it to form the basis of its collusion investigation, which is now being overseen by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Fusion GPS reportedly first began investigating Trump in Sept. 2015 after being hired by a Republican donor who opposed the former real estate magnate. After Trump ascended to the GOP nomination, the Republican donor dropped from the project, but a supporter of Hillary Clinton’s stepped in to continue the investigation.

The firm hired Steele to ramp up the investigation. A former MI6 agent with an extensive background in Moscow, Steele relied upon his Russian sources for information about Trump’s various activities in Russia.

Steele’s sources claimed that the Russian government had blackmail material on Trump and have been cultivating him as an asset for years. The salacious claims have not been verified, and Trump has vehemently denied them.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has led a one-man campaign to find out more about Fusion GPS’ role in crafting the dossier. He has expressed concern that the FBI relied on the document given that Fusion was working on behalf of Trump’s political opponents.

He has pressed Fusion GPS on various matters regarding the dossier, including who paid for it. He has also pressed Fusion over work it did last year for an alliance of Russians who opposed the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law opposed by the Kremlin.

Two of the people in that alliance — Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya and Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin — attended the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr.

Some Trump backers have questioned whether Fusion GPS was sharing information with Russians who attended that meeting.

Despite all the questions raised about the dossier, Levy, the lawyer for Simpson, says that Fusion GPS stands by the information in the document.

“Today, a special counsel and three congressional committees are investigating ties between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. Fusion GPS is proud of the work it has conducted and stands by it,” Levy said.

“This investigation into Mr. Simpson began as a desperate attempt by the Trump campaign and its allies to smear Fusion GPS because of its reported connection to the Trump dossier,” he added.

Levy also suggested that the Judiciary Committee release a transcript of its interview with Simpson, which was conducted in private.

“The Committee has a transcript of the interview. We are not permitted to have a copy. The Committee has the right to disclose the transcript, if it wishes to do so,” he said.

“You guys love to talk about Russia and there’s been nonstop coverage, and the one day that there might have been a question on Russia, there wasn’t,” Sanders said at the end of Thursday’s daily press briefing.

She pointed to testimony given before the Senate Judiciary Committee by Bill Browder, a London-based businessman who has been investigated by Fusion GPS, the Washington, D.C.-based firm that also financed the dossier. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Oppo Research Firm Behind Trump Dossier Worked On Pro-Kremlin Lobbying Effort)

Sanders asserted that Browder’s testimony “further discredited the phony dossier that’s been the source of so much of the fake news and conspiracy theories.”

“And we learned that the firm that produced it was also being paid by the Russians.”

During the same period that Fusion GPS was working on the dossier, the firm was also working on behalf of a Russian businessman and Kremlin-connected lawyer to rollback the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 sanctions law spearheaded in the U.S. by Browder.

Fusion’s job was to discredit Browder and his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who uncovered an alleged $230 million money laundering scheme perpetrated against Browder’s businesses in Russia. Magnitsky was arrested and jailed after uncovering the scheme, and he died in a Russian jail in 2009. Browder alleges that Magnitsky was tortured and beaten to death because of his role in the investigation.

Fusion’s work on the dossier reportedly began last June after a supporter of Hillary Clinton’s hired the firm to investigate Trump’s ties to Russia. The firm hired former British spy Christopher Steele to conduct the investigation. He would go on to produce 35 pages of memos dated between June 20 and Dec. 13.

The dossier, which was published by BuzzFeed on Jan. 10, has reportedly been used by the FBI as the basis for some of its investigation into potential links between the Trump campaign and Russian government.

But Fusion GPS’s involvement in the dossier — both because of its politically-motivated client and because of the firm’s work for pro-Kremlin interests — has led many to question the veracity of the document.

While Browder’s main concern is the Magnitsky Act, he told The Daily Caller in January that he questioned the accuracy of the dossier because of Fusion GPS’s involvement in the project.

And on Thursday, Browder alleged that Fusion GPS pitched false stories about him and Magnitsky to various news outlets in an attempt to smear him.

While Browder has no insight into Fusion’s work on the dossier, the White House jumped on his criticism of the firm’s work in order to discredit the anti-Trump document it produced.

“This is yet the latest piece of evidence that vindicates what the president said, that this is a witch hunt and a hoax,” Sanders told reporters. “And it’s a shame that the president and the country have this to go through this charade and hopefully this will help us move forward in that process.”

In the interview with Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer, denied all reports that Trump Jr. asked her for damaging information on Clinton. Veselnitskaya explained that Trump Jr. asked questions related to improper financing of the Clinton presidential campaign.

“The question that I was asked was as follows: whether I had any financial records which might prove that the funds used to sponsor the DNC were coming from inappropriate sources,” she said.

Trump Jr.’s meeting with Veselnitskaya took place on June 9, 2016, at Trump Tower in New York City — two days after Trump became the Republican nominee. He admitted he sought information on Clinton in a statement to The New York Times Monday but claimed he did not know if Veselnitskaya had connections to the Russian government prior to the meeting. The lawyer denied having any connection with the Russian government in the interview with NBC. A representative for Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that he does not know Veselnitskaya and had no knowledge of the meeting.

WATCH:

TheNYT reported Monday that Trump Jr. was told in an email before arranging the meeting that the Russian government was behind the damaging information. The email was allegedly sent by Rob Goldstone, a former British tabloid reporter who helped Trump Jr. arrange the meeting. The email indicates that the damaging Clinton information came from the Russian government but does not indicate if they got the information from the Democratic National Committee hack.

With his name in the spotlight, Trump Jr. has continued to blast the media and the Democrats about their coverage of his meeting with the Russian lawyer, saying it was “nonsense” and calling them desperate in a tweet sent out Tuesday morning.

“Your son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner is currently under investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller,” the lawmakers responsible for the letter wrote, according to a draft obtained by The Hill.

“He is also plainly unfit for the highly influential position he currently occupies. We write to urge you in the strongest possible terms to dismiss him immediately,” the letter continued.

Rep. Steven Gallega of Arizona and Rep. Ted Lieu of California are reportedly leading the effort to draft the correspondence, which has received nine signatures thus far. The lawmakers’ intention is to place pressure on the White House to dismiss Kushner over his failure to disclose his foreign contacts, Gallego told the Hill.

The Democratic effort comes days after Kushner testified in front of the House and Senate intelligence committees in back to back close door hearings. Kushner was called to Capitol Hill to provide information related to a June 2016 meeting which he attended along with Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Rob Goldstone and former Soviet intelligence officer, Rinat Akhmetshin.

The pair met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya with the understanding that she would provide damaging information related to Russian support for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.

Investigators likely also asked Kushner about a pair of May reports in the New York Times and the Washington Post, which indicate that Kushner attempted to establish backchannel lines of communication to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“Why is he even still there? The idea that he still has a job is absolutely ridiculous,” Gallego told the Hill Thursday. “Anyone else would have already been fired or had federal charges filed for erroneous entries into SF-86,” he said in reference to the mandatory disclosure form required to obtain a security clearance.

Gallega said he had not yet contacted House Minority Nancy Pelosi regarding the letter. Pelosi called for the immediate revocation of Kushner’s security clearance during a July 13 press conference. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Kushner denies intentionally omitting his foreign contacts, arguing that the omissions were the result of a secretarial error which was quickly corrected. Kushner failed to disclose all of his foreign contacts, not just those with Russians.

“Let me very clear: I did not collude with Russia nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so,” Kushner told reporters Monday following his Senate testimony.

Glenn Simpson, the head of the Washington, D.C.-based Fusion GPS, is listed as a witness for the July 19 hearing alongside Bill Browder, the London-based CEO of Hermitage Capital.

Browder confirmed to The Daily Caller earlier this week that he is “definitely” testifying at the hearing, which will explore shortcomings in the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), a law that requires people working for foreign governments in the U.S. to disclose their work.

It is not yet clear if Simpson will attend. He has recently rebuffed information requests from the Judiciary Committee about his various political projects, including on the dossier. Simpson’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment if his client will show up next Wednesday. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Oppo Researcher Behind Trump Dossier Worked On Pro-Kremlin Lobbying Effort)

Browder and Fusion GPS have a history.

Last July, Browder filed a complaint with the Justice Department accusing the oppo firm of failing to properly register under FARA for its work on a pro-Kremlin lobbying effort to roll back the Magnitsky Act.

Browder, who was born in the U.S. but has British citizenship, was the leading force behind the 2012 bill, which allows for sanctions against Russian businessmen accused of human rights abuses.

Fusion GPS worked for the law firm BakerHostetler to investigate Browder in order to undercut the Magnitsky Act. Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer in the news this week because of her meeting last June with Donald Trump Jr., also worked on the effort. As did Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet intelligence agent who works as a lobbyist in Washington. (RELATED: Senate Panel To Hear From Businessman Targeted By Trump Dossier Firm)

The Russian government is vehemently opposed to the Magnitsky Act, which is named after Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer for Browder who died in a Russian jail in 2009 under suspicious circumstances.

While Fusion GPS was carrying out its research on Browder, the firm was also working on a project that uncovered alleged spying activity by the Kremlin: the Trump dossier.

Last June, Fusion GPS began working for an unidentified ally of Hillary Clinton’s to research Trump’s activities in Russia. Simpson hired former British spy Christopher Steele to carry out the investigation.

The product of that contract was a 35-page memo full of salacious claims about Kremlin blackmail and collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russian government.

Fusion GPS distributed parts of the dossier to reporters before and after the election.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary committee, will likely use next week’s hearing to press Simpson on both of his firm’s projects — should the former Wall Street Journal reporter show up to the hearing.

Grassley has been most interested in Fusion’s work on the dossier. The Republican has questioned why the FBI used a document funded by political opponents of Trump as part of its investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.

Grassley has more recently addressed Fusion GPS’s work last year on the anti-Magnitsky project.

For its part, Fusion has refused to cooperate with Grassley’s requests. The firm has cited confidentiality protections, attorney-client privilege and First Amendment privileges in denying Grassley’s requests for information about its clients and its arrangements with Steele and the FBI.

Donald Trump Jr. released emails Tuesday that showed that he was willing to receive negative information on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government.

Trump Jr. went on to appear on Fox News’ “Hannity” that night, and said that he wished he “would have done things a little differently.”

“So I don’t even think my sirens went up, or the antennas went up at this time, because it wasn’t the issue that it’s been made out to be over the last nine months, 10 months, since it really became a thing,” Trump Jr. said.

Trump tweeted that this was a “good job,” and that his son was “open, transparent and innocent.”

“This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history,” the president added. “Sad!”

My son Donald did a good job last night. He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2017

Trump also retweeted a quote from Fox News’ Jesse Watters that said, “I believe Don Jr. is the victim here.”

A British publicist, Rob Goldstone, reached out to Trump Jr. in June 2016 in order to set up a meeting between him and a Russian attorney. He wrote in an email that he could get Trump’s son “official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

“This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,” Goldstone continued. Trump Jr. responded, “if it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.”

Trump Jr. later met with the Russian attorney, along with campaign manager Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner. The president’s son maintained on “Hannity” that the meeting was uneventful.

The attorney, Natalia Veselnitskaya, who is linked to the Kremlin, said that Kushner left a few minutes after the meeting had started.

“I think what happened [is] he sort of goosed up, he built up, there was some puffery to the email, perhaps to get the meeting, to make it happen,” Trump Jr. told “Hannity.” “In the end, there was probably some bait-and-switch about what it was really supposed to be about.”

Trump Jr. says they instead discussed adoption policy and a law that sanctions several Russians."

In a new interview with The Mirror, Morris contends that Pence has President Trump‘s back for now. But if the tide or Congress turns, so might Pence.

Pence has vociferously denied any interest in holding himself out as a replacement for Trump despite holding a fundraiser in July to promote his Great American Committee.

Morris is promoting his new book, ROGUE SPOOKS: The Intelligence War On Donald Trump, and is giving a slew of interviews. He says mine is likely his 100th interview. And this is Part II — The Mirror caught up with him last week for Part I. Morris graciously gave me more time since I had a half page of questions remaining when Morris ended the call.

On the pardoning of former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio: “I think he was right. I think the pardoning of Joe Arpaio was a good move.”

Even so, Morris sees a pattern with Trump that he finds “disturbing.” He sees a number of Trump actions that directly contradict his campaign promises. “Not just peripheral pledges,” he says. “They were key to his campaign.”

An example: “In July, when [Trump] announced that Iran was in full compliance with the deal. Every 90 days the President is obliged to certify that. But it represented a huge retreat.”

On the other hand, Morris is “thrilled” that Trump is using the Magnitsky Act to go after people in Venezuela and Pakistan. Magnitsky, he explains, was a whistleblower who discovered massive corruption in Russia and was tortured and murdered.

“The key thing about Magnitsky is that it targets individuals. It’s a gutsy and courageous call.”

Morris calls Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) “brilliant and wonderful.” Sen. Maj. Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), meanwhile, is “a hack.”

Which brings us to the what ifs of Trump getting impeached.

“If Trump is impeached I don’t think he can rely on the Senate Republicans to defend him,” he says. “This makes the situation more difficult for him. This whole situation has moved into a new phase. First you deny the allegation and then you shoot the alligator.”

Morris is proud of his “alligator” joke, but he has a much funnier Clinton line coming later.

The former longtime campaign consultant and pollster says Trump’s enemies are aiming to use the 25th Amendment to oust him from office.

Morris is brimming with wonky details.

“The vice president can certify that the president is incapable of doing the abilities of office, he explained. “There is a body that either is cabinet members or a special body created by Congress which analyzes the certificiation. If it’s found to be accurate, the matter is turned over to Congress. [Trump] can always apply to get his job back, but it’s a coup.”

He says liberal accusations against Trump are becoming increasingly specific — he thinks they are part of the “deep state” and discusses them at length in his book. Morris says it’s an “intelligence media coup. I think they’ve all decided – [Joe] Scarborough and others to take the next step.”

So can Trump depend on Pence?

Morris is iffy.

“I think he can depend on him now,” he says. “Who knows what that relationship will be in the future because Trump alienates everybody. I think it’s a very good relationship. I think Pence has been very loyal, but you never know about the future.”

Morris has a little experience with shifting allegiances.

Asked if he’s on good terms with his former bosses, the Clintons, he replies, “None. They send me a Christmas card each year but there is white powder on the outside.”

Morris starts to laugh. Is he being serious about the Christmas card?

“No, no,” he says chuckling. “Good story though.”"

NBC News is reporting that Manafort’s notes from the June 9, 2016, session show that the word “donations” was placed near a reference to the Republican National Committee. Manafort typed notes from the meeting into his phone as he sat in on the session, which was attended by Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and a group of Russians.

It is not clear what exactly Manafort’s notes referred to, though they have reportedly raised the suspicion of investigators working for Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director leading the investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential campaign.

Another possibility for Manafort’s notes would be donations to the Democratic National Committee or Hillary Clinton campaign. The Trump Tower meeting was organized by Donald Trump Jr. after he was approached by an acquaintance who offered damaging information about Clinton.

It has been reported that the person offering the information, a Russian lawyer named Natalia Veselnitskaya, provided Trump Jr. with documents alleging that associates of a London-based businessman named Bill Browder made political contributions to Democrats.

Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin, who both attended the Trump Tower meeting, were operating a smear campaign of Browder as part of a lobbying effort to undercut the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law that Browder helped push through Congress.

Manafort, whose foreign business activities are being investigated by Mueller, gave his notes to Mueller’s investigators and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.

According to NBC, Mueller’s team is also interested in whether President Trump gave misleading statements about whether he knew about the Trump Tower meeting.

Trump Jr. organized the event after being contacted by an acquaintance who offered to provide damaging information about Hillary Clinton. The acquaintance, a music publicist named Rob Goldstone, attended along with Veslenitskaya and Akhmetshin, a former Soviet military official and Washington, D.C.-based political operative.

Akhmetshin was reportedly interviewed by Mueller’s team on Aug. 11 about the Trump Tower meeting.

There have been conflicting claims about what was discussed in the meeting, which all parties have said lasted less than 30 minutes.

Trump Jr. initially claimed in a statement to The New York Times, which broke the story of the meeting, that it was held to discuss Russia’s policy on adoptions of Russian children by U.S. citizens. The Russian government banned the adoptions in 2013 as retaliation for passage of the Magnitsky Act.

After the first Times report, Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya came out and said that the meeting was actually about the Magnitsky Act rather than strictly about adoptions. Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin have worked on a lobbying campaign to rollback the Magtnisky Act. Part of their strategy to convince lawmakers to neuter the law is to portray it as a hindrance to adoptions of Russian children.

Akhmetshin, who is said to have links to Russian government officials, has claimed in at least one interview that political information was exchanged during the meeting. He told the Associated Press that Veselnitskaya left behind documents after the meeting.

Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of Fusion GPS, the firm that commissioned the Trump dossier, will plead the Fifth at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing scheduled for Wednesday, his lawyers say.

Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, was subpoenaed by the committee on Friday after his lawyers said that he would be out of the country on vacation at the time of the hearing, which will explore shortcomings in the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the committee, has been interested in speaking to Simpson about Fusion GPS’s role in two matters: the salacious and uncorroborated Trump dossier, and a lobbying campaign carried out last year against the Magnitsky Act, a law that places sanctions against Russian human rights abusers.

Fusion GPS was hired last June by a supporter of Hillary Clinton’s to investigate Trump’s dealings in Russia. The firm then hired former British spy Christopher Steele to conduct the research.

Simpson was initially scheduled to testify on Wednesday alongside Donald Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort, but the latter two reached a deal with the committee to avoid appearing in public. Instead, they will talk to the committee in a closed session.

Trump Jr. and Manafort were invited by the committee in order to discuss the June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer named Natalia Veselnitskaya.

Trump Jr. had been told that Veselnitskaya would provide derogatory information about Hillary Clinton. During the meeting, she focused on the Magnitsky Act.

Fusion GPS figures into the case because the firm worked alongside Veselnitskaya on an anti-Magnitsky Act lobbying campaign. Fusion’s role was to investigate Bill Browder, a London-based financial manager who is the catalyst behind the Magnitsky Act.

The 2012 bill is named after Browder’s lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky. He died under mysterious circumstances in a Russian prison in 2009 after investigating a money laundering scheme carried out by Russian businessmen.

Last July, Browder filed a complaint with the Justice Department alleging that Simpson, Veselnitskaya, and others involved in the anti-Magnitsky effort, violated FARA, which requires individuals who work for foreign governments to provide details of their activities.

In a letter to Grassley on Friday, Simpson’s lawyers said that they are “profoundly disturbed” by the committee’s request of Simpson.

“We are profoundly disturbed that the scope of the proposed hearing has expanded, due to private and partisan agendas,” wrote Simpson’s lawyers, Joshua Levy and Robert Muse.

They also claimed that the allegations from Browder that Simpson failed to properly register under FARA “are nothing more than an effort to smear him and his firm.”

“In the event of a subpoena, Mr. Simpson will assert applicable privileges, including but not limited to those under the First and Fifth Amendments. We therefore ask that he be excused from appearing,” the letter reads.

Fusion’s lawyers have said that the firm was not aware of the Trump Tower meeting until it was reported in the news earlier this month.

In an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union,” California Rep. Adam Schiff said that he would be willing to travel to London to meet with Steele, a retired MI6 agent who was hired by a Washington, D.C. opposition firm last June to investigate any Trump ties to Russia.

“We would like to have him come before the committee. If he’s not willing to do that, we would be happy, Mr. Conaway and myself, to go to London to sit down with him,” Schiff said, referring to Texas Rep. Mike Conaway, the Republican overseeing the committee’s Russia investigation.

“He does have, I think, certainly very relevant information that would assist our investigation. We want to do this certainly in a cooperative way,” Schiff said of Steele, who operates the research firm, Orbis Business Intelligence, in London.

Steele was hired last June by opposition research firm Fusion GPS. Founded by former Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson, Fusion GPS was investigating Trump on behalf of a political ally of Hillary Clinton’s.

The 35-page dossier, which was published by BuzzFeed News in January, makes numerous uncorroborated allegations about Trump and members of his campaign. The most sensational claim in the first memo of the dossier, dated June 20, 2016, is that Kremlin operatives have video recordings of Trump with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel. (RELATED: Does The Steele Dossier Describe What Happened In The Trump Tower Meeting?)

Steele’s unnamed sources claimed that the Kremlin was attempting to cultivate Trump. Other memos in the dossier allege that Trump campaign members met in secret with Russian operatives to discuss ways to sway the election in Trump’s favor.

Trump has emphatically denied the dossier allegations, saying that he did not hire prostitutes in Russia or collude with the Kremlin.

But Schiff said Sunday that the dossier has taken on new significance in light of the revelation that Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., met with a group of Russians in Trump Tower last June.

“We want to look at each of the allegations within the so-called dossier, and particularly look at them now in light of what we know from that Don Jr. meeting about the intent of the campaign to get Russian help,” Schiff said.

Steele’s June 20 memo vaguely describes what may have occurred in the Trump Tower meeting.

Citing “a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure and a former top level Russian intelligence officer still active inside the Kremlin,” Steele wrote that Trump “and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.”

Eleven days before that memo was written, Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort met with a Russian lawyer named Natalia Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet military officer who now works as a political operative in Washington, D.C.

Trump Jr. accepted the meeting after being offered derogatory information about Hillary Clinton. He was told by an acquaintance that a “Russian government attorney” would be providing the information, which was being provided by Russia’s top government prosecutor.

Steele’s sourcing for the dossier would be key to determining its veracity.

Because he is unable to operate in Russia because of his previous spy career, Steele reportedly gathered information laid out in the dossier by paying intermediaries who spoke to Russian sources.

The dossier does not identify sources by name. Instead, Steele refers to them as “Source A,” “Source B,” etc., or by describing their connections to the Russian government.

But some analysts have suggested that Steele’s sources could have purposely planted disinformation about Trump and about Russian efforts to meddle in the campaign.

47,##########,http://dailycaller.com/2017/08/24/trump-dossier-testimony-could-be-published-by-senate-judiciary/,Trump Dossier Testimony Could Be Published By Senate Judiciary,[],Daily Caller,"The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said on Wednesday that he’s open to releasing a transcript of an interview given this week by Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of Trump dossier firm Fusion GPS.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the committee, said at a town hall meeting that the Judiciary panel has to vote in favor of releasing a transcript of the interview between committee staff and Glenn Simpson, Fusion’s co-founder. But pressed by a constituent at the town hall, Grassley said he sees no reason why he would not vote to release the transcript

“Of course we’ll put it to a vote of the committee,” said Grassley. When asked if he would vote in favor of releasing the transcript, Grassley said: “I don’t why I wouldn’t, but I don’t want to say so.”

“I’m not going to answer your question before I get a firm footing of what the precedent is,” he added.

MSNBC host Rachel Maddow aired footage of Grassley’s comments.

If released, the transcript would no doubt shed new light on the Fusion GPS dossier, which has reportedly been used by the FBI as the basis for its investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government during the presidential campaign.

It would also likely reveal Fusion GPS’ role in a controversial lobbying campaign last year against the Magnitsky Act, a law which imposes sanctions against Russian businessmen accused of human rights abuses.

Fusion GPS was working on that lobbying campaign alongside a Russian attorney and Russian-American lobbyist who attended the June 9, 2016, meeting held at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

Fusion’s work on that effort appears to be at odds with its work on the dossier, which, if true, would implicate the Kremlin in a scheme to influence the American democratic system.

While working for a political ally of Hillary Clinton, Fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele to investigate Trump’s activities in Russia. The result is a 35-page dossier of memos full of salacious and uncorroborated allegations of sexual deviancy and campaign collusion.

Trump has vehemently denied the claims in the document, which BuzzFeed News published on Jan. 10.

But Josh Levy, Simpson’s lawyer, said after his 10-hour testimony on Tuesday that the opposition researcher, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, stands by the dossier. Levy also said that Simpson declined to disclose the identities of the clients who hired his firm to investigate Trump.

Prior to working for a Clinton ally, Fusion GPS was reportedly hired by an anti-Trump Republican donor. Simpson and Fusion GPS have declined identifying the clients, citing confidentiality agreements.

At Wednesday’s town hall, Grassley told his constituent that the committee would need to allow Fusion GPS to review a transcript of the marathon interview before releasing it.

But in a statement to Maddow, Levy suggested that the Judiciary Committee can release the transcript without review.

In addition to the political clients who hired Fusion GPS, the sources who provided information to Steele have been a major interest for investigators, reporters and the public. The veracity of Steele’s document will likely hinge on his sources.

Steele reportedly paid intermediaries to obtain information from sources inside Russia. The former MI6 agent no longer operates in Russia because of his past spying activity.

Conway was confronted with a clip of her past denial of meetings between Trump campaign officials and Russians during an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” After playing the clip, host George Stephanopoulos asked Conway pointedly who had “misled her” and why those present at the recently revealed meeting let the “denials stand for so many months.”

“As I understand it George, some of the disclosure forms have been amended since that time and to reflect other meetings including this one,” Conway responded.

Conway’s comments come one day after The New York Times reported Trump Jr. met with a Kremlin-connected lawyer in June of 2016 under the impression that the Russian had damaging information about Clinton. Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his son-in-law Jared Kushner also attended the meeting at Trump Tower.

The term “disclosure forms” likely refers to documents filed by Kushner to obtain a security clearance, which initially indicated he never had any foreign contacts. He later submitted supplemental information reflecting numerous contacts with foreign officials. Most recently he revised the disclosure forms to include the meeting with the Kremlin-connected lawyer.

During the interview, Conway downplayed the importance of the meeting, saying “No information was received that was meaningful or helpful, and no action was taken. There was no follow up whatsoever.”

TheNYTimes first reported the meeting Saturday, at which point Trump Jr. conceded the meeting took place but maintained there was no mention of Clinton. After being confronted with the new report, which included the anti-Hillary motivation behind the meeting, Trump Jr. admitted he met with the Russian lawyer after he was told he would receive information related to Russian support for Clinton’s campaign. He maintains he did not end up receiving any damaging info related to Clinton.

Investigators hope to find out what, if anything, Graff knows about the June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney named Natalia Veselnitskaya.

A senior vice president of the Trump Organization, Graff was mentioned in an email exchange between Trump Jr. and Rob Goldstone, a music publicist who sought out the Trump Tower meeting.

“I can also send this info to your father via Rhona, but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first,” Goldstone wrote in an email to Trump Jr.

Goldstone, who represents Russian-Azerbaijani pop musician Emin Agalarov, and is a friend of the Trump family, first contacted Trump Jr. on June 3, 2016, saying that a “Russian government attorney” wanted to meet with him to provide damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

Trump Jr. enthusiastically agreed to the meeting, which was attended on the Trump campaign signed by Jared Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Veselnitskaya and Goldstone were joined by several others, including a Russian-American lobbyist who some U.S. officials suspect may have contacts to the Kremlin.

Three congressional committees — the House Intelligence, Senate Intelligence and Senate Judiciary — are all investigating various issues related to Russia’s meddling in the presidential campaign, including the Trump Tower conclave. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is also interested in the matter.

It is not clear if Graff, a 30-year Trump Organization veteran, was made aware of the Trump Tower meeting. She was not included in the email chain, which Trump Jr. forwarded to Kushner and Manafort.

The White House has said that President Trump was not aware of the meeting until early last month, just before The New York Times reported about it.

Graff is well-known as a gatekeeper for the Trump family.

“Everybody knows in order to get through to him they have to go through me, so they are always on their best behavior,” Graff told Real Estate Weekly in 2004, ABC News noted.

One Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee told ABC News that the panel will want to talk to Graff.

“Since her name is in the email, people will want her to answer questions,” New York Rep. Peter King told the outlet.

King, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, says he knows Graff.

“If you go into Trump Tower, you’re going to mention her name,” he said.

“I believe this was indeed a Kremlin operation,” Daniel Hoffman, a 30-year CIA veteran, told The Cipher Brief. “I see this more as an attempted influence operation rather than traditional intelligence collection.”

The June 2016 meeting was brokered by a former acquaintance of the Trump family under the auspices of providing Russian government provided opposition research on Hillary Clinton to the Trump 2016 campaign. Former Soviet military intelligence officer Rinat Akhmetshin and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya attended the meeting, along with Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort, a presidential advisor to Jared Kushner who was President Trump’s campaign manager at the time.

Hoffman highlighted the presence of the Russian intelligence officer, saying his attendance “would lend credence to the Kremlin’s strategy of creating the impression of Russian government involvement from a distance, and add a measure of intrigue, given he served in the Soviet military.”

“I would assess Russia wanted to create the appearance of collusion even if there was in fact no real evidence any collusion ever took place,” Hoffman told The Cipher Brief. Emails released by Trump Jr himself explicitly mention Veselnitskaya’s supposed connection to the Russian government and cast it as an attempt by the Russians to help the Trump campaign.

Here is page 4 (which did not post due to space constraints). pic.twitter.com/z1Xi4nr2gq — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017

The meeting may also have been an effort “to induce an investigative process, media coverage, and political infighting with an eye towards negatively impacting our government’s ability to function,” Hoffman added. “This is President Putin’s goal, after having tried to soil our electoral process, he is now turning his attention to interfering and damaging our governing process.”

If Hoffman’s assessment of the meeting’s intention is correct it has certainly had the desired effect. The revelation of Trump Jr.’s meeting has inspired wall to wall media coverage and thrown the White House into a frenzy. Trump has entered the fray to defend his son, and legal proceedings over the matter are likely for some time to come.

Rinat Akhmetshin served as an officer in the former Soviet military and is a fairly well-known lobbyist in Washington.

Akhmetshin reportedly met with Mueller’s grand jury on Aug. 11 and provided testimony under sworn oath for several hours. His testimony concerned the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York City, which was attended by Donald Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort and Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.

The June 2016 meeting has been at the center of the allegations that Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to undermine the 2016 presidential election. Akhmetshin’s private meeting with Mueller’s grand jury likely shows that Mueller views it as a key event in his investigation.

Mueller was appointed in May to potential links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. He also has the legal authority to press charges.

Trump Jr.’s says the meeting was sold to him an opportunity to obtain damaging information on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. His statement was corroborated when Trump Jr. released an email exchange in which publicist Rob Goldstone told him that a Russian lawyer “offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary [Clinton] … and would be very useful to your father.”

“He goes up on Twitter again yesterday only to be undercut by the New York Times last night because inside his own White House, inside his own administration are leaking on him.”

54,##########,http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/27/donald-trump-jr-faces-nonsensical-attacks/,Donald Trump Jr. Faces Nonsensical Attacks,[],Daily Caller,"One misleading New York Times story. For the Left and their media allies, that’s all it takes for Donald Trump Jr. to become Public Enemy No. 1.

The headlines have ranged from the wildly inaccurate (“Trump Jr. Meeting Broke Campaign Finance Laws”) to the downright insane (“Trump Jr.’s Action Meet a Standard for Treason.”) One New Republic writer even claimed “the biggest political scandal since Watergate is busting wide open thanks to the overwhelming power of pure stupidity.”

A dose of reality is in order. No, Trump Jr.’s meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya—a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin—did not break any campaign finance laws. Not a single one. And it was certainly no act of treason. The radical Left is so intent on undermining President Trump’s agenda that they throw around terms like “treason” with no sense of their meaning. Of course, if Chelsea Clinton took the same meeting to find compromising information about a Republican, the liberal media would sing praises about her political acumen.

Alas, basic facts have been replaced by political spin and left-wing fearmongering. The alleged conversation took place because Veselnitskaya, a foreign attorney specially admitted to the country by the Obama Justice Department, purportedly promised to explain how Russians were funding the Democratic National Committee and assisting Hillary Clinton. According to even The New York Times, she never shared those details with Trump Jr. But his willingness to even discuss them has lit the Left on fire.

Three liberal so-called “advocacy” groups—the Campaign Legal Center, Common Cause, and Democracy 21—have now filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) accusing Trump Jr. of illegally coordinating with Russia during the 2016 campaign. The complaint claims he broke campaign finance law for “soliciting contributions from foreign nationals.”

This is demonstrably false on several fronts. First, the facts conveyed in Trump Jr.’s meeting with Veselnitskaya do not constitute a “contribution” because they do not qualify as a “gift.” Information conveyed in a political conversation would not ordinarily be considered a “gift,” so why apply it in this case? In a statutory sense, a “contribution” requires a change in the legal relations or liabilities of the person who allegedly conferred it. Trump Jr.’s legal relations and liabilities did not change simply by having a political conversation. And under common law, the term “gift” has a well-established meaning and does not include facts conveyed in a political discussion. The Left loves to invent new meanings for words, but the law here is clear, and the Left is clearly wrong on it.

Moreover, the useless gossip supposedly sought from Veselnitskaya cannot be an illegal “contribution” because they do not qualify as something “of value.” For something to be deemed “of value” under campaign finance law, a person must ordinarily charge for providing it—a fact not even the Left is alleging because there isn’t a shred of evidence it happened.

In fact, it would be unconstitutional for the FEC to interpret federal law so broadly as to prohibit Trump Jr. from freely engaging in conversations about any presidential candidate with any individual—including a non-citizen. Such a broad interpretation would effectively allow the federal government to punish Americans for engaging in pure political speech. This, of course, comes into direct conflict with the First Amendment and the democratic principles upon which our country is built.

For these reasons, the Committee to Defend the President (CDP) is stepping in. On Thursday, we will submit a legal brief to the FEC in defense of Trump Jr., arguing the meeting constituted neither a “contribution of value” nor grounds to infringe upon his—or any American’s—First Amendment rights. As the brief states, the FEC should dismiss this frivolous, self-serving complaint altogether because Trump Jr. “did not solicit, accept, or receive a ‘contribution’ or ‘donation.’”

Besieged by a radical Left and their enablers in the media, our private citizens and the Constitution have become the victims of a political vendetta. Only if we defend them can America truly be great again.

Ted Harvey is chairman of the Committee to Defend the President."
55,##########,http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/14/heres-what-we-know-about-the-suspected-ex-soviet-intel-officer-who-attended-trump-tower-meeting/,Here‚Äôs What We Know About The Suspected Ex-Soviet Intel Officer Who Attended Trump Tower Meeting,[],Daily Caller,"After it was reported on Friday that a suspected former Soviet intelligence officer attended the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting, a mad dash is on to find out more about the man, Rinat Akhmetshin.

A naturalized American citizen, Akhmetshin is often cited as a lobbyist, but details about his activities in Washington, D.C. portray him as something more.

NBC News first reported that a suspected former Soviet intelligence officer accompanied Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya to the meeting. Akhmetshin later confirmed to the Associated Press that he attended.

He is a well-connected political operative who works closely with Washington, D.C. reporters by providing opposition research on behalf of his clients. He has also formed several small non-profit groups aimed at advancing the interests of Russian clients and others from Soviet satellite nations.

In a 2015 legal filing, a lawyer who worked with Akhmetshin described him as “a recognized expert on business and political matters in Kazakhstan, Russia and other former Soviet countries.”

That lawyer, Patrick Salisbury, also stated that Akhmetshin has “a wide network of connections in those circles as well as in the media.”

Salisbury denied the main allegation made in that lawsuit, that Akhmetshin had orchestrated a hack of the computer systems of a mining company called International Mineral Resources. Salisbury and Akhmetshin worked for a business rival of that firm’s called EuroChem.

Salisbury said he had never heard Akhmetshin discuss hacking or any other “improper data gathering,” and Akhmetshin denied the charge, though he did say that he obtained documents from IMR through seemingly shady means.

Akhmetshin acknowledged that he obtained the IMR documents through something called the London information bazaar, an information exchange network used by journalists, investigators and operatives.

Akhmetshin said in the May 2015 deposition, which was obtained by The Daily Caller, that he gave a memory stick containing IRM documents to an Israeli businessman during a Jan. 30, 2014 meeting at a London coffee shop.

The lobbyist-operative also has deep contacts to Washington, D.C. and international media outlets. Salisbury said that Akhmetshin frequently worked with the Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and the Guardian.

He also said that Akhmetshin worked with Global Witness, an anti-corruption watchdog group he described as being “funded by George Soros and others.”

Akhmetshin “obtains research information” from the Soros-backed group, Salisbury said.

As part of the IMR-EuroChem lawsuit, Akhmetshin was ordered to provide a list of people he emailed with as part of his work on that case. The list includes reporters from The Guardian, Harper’s magazine, and other outlets.

IMR dropped the case last year, withdrawing its allegation that EuroChem and Akhmetshin hacked the firm’s computers.

Akhmetshin was also identified as the force behind a smear campaign waged against Ashot Egiazaryan, a former deputy for the Russian Duma.

In 2011, Egiazaryan accused Akhmetshin of spreading rumors and false stories to reporters in order to prevent him from obtaining political asylum in the U.S.

Egiazaryan sought asylum because he faced criminal charges related to a business dealing involving a Russian billionaire.

RadioFreeEurope reported extensively on that legal case.

He has also formed or been linked to at least three small non-profit groups that deal with issues related to Russia or former Soviet nation. He founded the Azeri Democracy Initiative Foundation and Kazakhstan 21st Century Foundation, according to lobbying records filed with Congress.

He is also a registered lobbyist for the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation (HRAGIF).

It was with Natalia Veselnitskaya, an associate of HRAGIF, that Akhmetshin attended the Trump Tower meeting.

That meeting was attended by Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

Emails released by Trump Jr. show that he agreed to the meeting after being promised that he would be provided with negative information about Hillary Clinton.

Akhmetshin told the Associated Press that Trump Jr. asked about the information, which Veselnitskaya ended up not providing. He also said that Veselnitskaya brought documents with her to the meeting, but he said he did not know what information was in those documents or whether she gave them to the Trump team.

HRAGIF was formed last year under the auspices of ending Russia’s ban against U.S. citizens adopting children.

Russian president Vladimir Putin enacted the ban in retaliation for passage of the Magnitsky Act in 2012. That law allows for sanctions to be placed against Russians accused of human rights abuses.

Politico and The Daily Beast reported last year that Akhmetshin was seen on Capitol Hill meeting with U.S. lawmakers to lobby against the Magnitsky Act. Former Democratic California Rep. Ron Dellums was also hired onto the lobbying effort. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Oppo Researcher Behind Trump Dossier Took Part In Pro-Kremlin Lobbying Effort)

California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican who has praised Putin in the past, has acknowledged meeting with Akhmetshin. CNN also reported earlier this year that Rohrabacher and Akhmetshin were spotted meeting in Berlin.

Akhmetshin and Veselnitskaya have another strange connection.

Also involved in the anti-Magnitsky lobbying push was Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm behind the uncorroborated dossier alleging various misdeeds by President Trump and members of his campaign.

Fusion GPS was hired by a law firm called BakerHostetler to investigate Bill Browder, the London-based financier lobbied heavily to pass the Magnitsky Act.

Sergei Magnitsky, the namesake for the law, was Browder’s lawyer. He died in a Russian prison in 2009 after being arrested while investigating a $230 million money laundering scheme that targeted Browder’s operations in Russia.

Veselnitskaya’s client is Denis Katsyv. His firm, Prevezon Holdings, was implicated in the scheme.

The entire complex swirl of operatives — Akhmetshin, Fusion, and Steele — have recently drawn the attention of Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley.

Grassley is set to hold a hearing next week regarding the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Browder will appear at that hearing as a witness. Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of Fusion GPS, was invited to the hearing but will reportedly decline to appear. (RELATED: Senate Panel To Hear Testimony From Businessman Targeted By Trump Dossier Firm)

Fusion GPS has denied knowing about the Veselnitskaya/Akhmetshin meeting at Trump Tower.

Akhmetshin has denied that he is affiliated with Russia’s intelligence agencies. But Browder says he doesn’t buy that claim.

“What this shows is that the Russian government was using intelligence assets like Rinat to run a highly resourced, very aggressive campaign to influence US policy to remove sanctions on Rusian torturers and murderers,” Browder told TheDC of the revelation that Akhmetshin was involved in the Trump Tower meeting.

Browder said that while he cannot speak to what was said in the Trump Tower meeting, he noted that Soviet and Russian intelligence agents are “highly trained in creating incentives for people to do what they want them to do.”

Akhmetshin is also a regular attendee at the Halifax International Security Forum.

That happens to be the same conference where Arizona Sen. John McCain was first told of the Steele dossier. Sir Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Russia and a business associate of Steele’s, discussed the dossier with McCain and one of his longtime associates, a former State Department official named David Kramer.

Kramer flew to England to obtain the dossier from Steele. He gave it to McCain, who provided a copy to then-FBI Director James Comey during a meeting in December.

There is no indication that McCain and Akhmetshin met at the conference.

Rinat Akhmetshin gave evidence to the grand jury during testimony on Aug. 11, the Financial Times reported.

Akhmetshin, a Washington, D.C. based political operative and former Soviet military officer, reportedly discussed his involvement in the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, which he attended with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer believed to have connections to the Russian government.

The meeting, which Trump Jr. accepted after being offered derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, has reportedly become a focus of the investigation being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Mueller, a former FBI director, has issued subpoenas through the federal grand jury as part of a probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Trump’s critics say that the Trump Tower meeting is evidence that collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government occurred, though Trump Jr. and the White House deny the allegation. Another possibility raised by analysts and pundits watching the investigation is that the Russians in the Trump Tower meeting were attempting to covertly infiltrate or compromise the Trump campaign.

Both Akhmetshin and Veselnitskaya have connections to high-ranking Russian government officials. Veselnitskaya is linked to Yury Chaika, Russia’s equivalent to attorney general. Akhmetshin has worked on behalf of Kremlin-linked businessmen on several projects and has reportedly served as a liaison to Russian government officials during tours in Washington, D.C.

At the time of the meeting, Akhmetshin and Veselnitskaya were working on a campaign to roll back the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law that places sanctions on Russian human rights abusers. The Russian government is highly critical of the law, so much so that Russian President Vladimir Putin retaliated by banning U.S. adoptions of Russian children.

Trump Jr., the White House, and Veselnitskaya have all claimed that the Magnitsky Act — and not Hillary Clinton — was the subject of the Trump Tower meeting, which was also attended by Jared Kushner and embattled former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. However, Akhmetshin said in an interview last month that Veselnitskaya left a binder of documents of a political nature behind after the meeting.

Whether or not information about Clinton was provided at the meeting, Trump Jr. accepted the meeting after being explicitly offered damning information about the former secretary of state. A Trump family acquaintance who pitched the idea also indicated that the Clinton dirt was being provided by the Russian government because of its support for Trump.

In a June 3, 2016, email, Rob Goldstone, the Trump family acquaintance, offered to provide Trump Jr. with the Hillary Clinton dirt through a “Russian government attorney.”

Trump Jr. jumped at the offer, telling Goldstone “If it is what you say I love it.”

Akhmetshin and Veselnitskaya have another bizarre connection to the Trump-Russia matter.

During the course of their work on the anti-Magnitsky Act effort, the duo collaborated with Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm the commissioned the infamous and uncorroborated dossier of research about Trump’s ties to Russia.

While it was involved in the dossier project, Fusion GPS was working on behalf of a Russian businessman represented by Veselnitskaya to investigate Bill Browder, a London-based financier who lobbied heavily on behalf of the Magnitsky Act.

It has been reported that the documents that Veselnitskaya gave to the Trump campaign regarded campaign contributions that Browder associates gave to Democratic political campaigns.

The overlap in the timeline of Fusion GPS’ work on the dossier and its involvement in the Magnitsky Act lobbying campaign has generated speculation that the opposition research firm was working with Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin on Trump-related matters.

When the Trump Tower meeting was first revealed by The New York Times last month, Trump’s legal team suggested that Fusion GPS and Veselnitskaya somehow set up the Trump campaign.

Akhmetshin’s involvement in the meeting raises the question of whether the lobbyist had any interactions about Trump with Fusion GPS, which was founded by former Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson.

A journalist who knows both Akhmetshin and Simpson has told The Daily Caller that the two run in the same opposition research circles. New York Times reporter Ken Vogel has also said on Twitter that Akhmetshin and Simpson have collaborated together in the past and shared sources for news stories and research projects.

57,##########,http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/12/does-the-steele-dossier-describe-what-happened-in-trump-tower-meeting/,Does The Steele Dossier Describe What Happened In Trump Tower Meeting?,[],Daily Caller,"Eleven days after Donald Trump Jr. met in his Trump Tower offices with a Kremlin-connected lawyer, former British spy Christopher Steele authored the first of 17 memos alleging various illicit connections between the Trump campaign and Russian government.

That dossier, which was financed by a political ally of Hillary Clinton, has been the subject of intense speculation since it was published by BuzzFeed News in January.

The document’s veracity has been questioned, and several inconsistencies have been found in the 17 memos. But the FBI reportedly used the Steele dossier to form the basis of its investigation into whether members of the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. FBI officials even obtained a surveillance warrant against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page based on the dossier’s allegations that he met secretly with Kremlin officials last July. (RELATED: Emails Show Trump Jr. Knew Information May Have Come From Russian Government)

Page strongly denied the claims and calls Steele’s document “the dodgy dossier.”

But some elements of Steele’s June 20 memo match up loosely with what’s known about the June 9 Trump Tower meeting.

Emails released on Tuesday by Donald Trump Jr. show that he agreed to take that meeting after he was told that “a Russian government attorney” would be providing him with derogatory information about Hillary Clinton.

On June 3, Rob Goldstone, a music publicist and acquaintance of the Trumps, wrote Trump Jr. saying that one of his clients “offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

“I love it,” Trump Jr. responded to Goldstone, whose main client is Emin Agalarov, the pop musician son of Russian billionaire and Putin crony Aras Agalarov.

Trump Jr. and Goldstone hammered out a schedule for the meeting, and eventually settled on June 9 as the date. Trump Tower was the location. Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort also attended.

Both Trump Jr. and Natalia Veselnitskaya, the lawyer he met with, say that no anti-Clinton information was provided during that meeting. Instead, both participants have said that Veselnitskaya spoke against the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law which places sanctions against Russians accused of human rights abuses.

In his June 20 memo, Steele describes a Kremlin-backed effort to provide the Trump campaign with information about Clinton.

Trump “and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals,” reads the memo, which Steele wrote based on information he received third-hand from “a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure and a former top level Russian intelligence officer still active inside the Kremlin.”

Steele, a former MI6 intelligence officer who worked in Moscow, was prohibited from visiting Russia. He reportedly obtained his information for the dossier by paying Russian sources. Steele’s reliance on indirect information has been one of the main critiques of the dossier.

Steele’s two sources claimed that “Russian authorities had been cultivating and supporting…Trump for at least five years.”

The second source asserted that the effort was supported by Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Goldstone’s emails to Trump Jr. do include a reference to the Russian government’s support for the Trump campaign.

“This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump — helped along by Aras and Emin,” wrote Goldstone, referring to the Agalarovs.

According to Steele, the senior Russian Foreign Ministry official had confided in Steele’s contact “that the Kremlin had been feeding Trump and his team valuable intelligence on his opponents, including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, for several years.”

According to Steele’s dossier, Russia’s intelligence agency, FSB, had been compiling a dossier of its own on Clinton for many years.

The dossier “comprised mainly eavesdropped conversations of various sorts rather than details/evidence of unorthodox or embarrassing behavior.”

Steele’s source claimed that some of the information was gleaned from bugged conversations Clinton had made during trips to Russia.

But that dossier “has not as yet been made available abroad, including to Trump or his campaign team,” Steele wrote.

The White House has vigorously denied the claims in the Steele report. And after the Trump Tower meeting with Veselnitskaya was revealed over the weekend, Trump’s legal team noted a peculiar connection between the lawyer and Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm who hired Steele to investigate Trump. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Oppo Researcher Behind Anti-Trump Dossier Worked On Pro-Kremlin Lobbying Campaign)

Veselnitskaya and Fusion GPS have worked for several years on the campaign to roll back the Magnitsky Act. Both Veselnitskaya and Fusion GPS worked with the law firm BakerHostetler as part of an influence campaign to neuter the sanctions bill, which the Kremlin strongly opposes.

Whatever you do, don’t ask Congress to investigate — not even to ask a few lame questions in five-minute increments. What’s the point? Congress is the most expensive dog-and-pony-show on earth. We, the Taxpayers, pay through the nose for these guys and gals to go to “work” every day: by my calculation (635 X $174,000), Capitol Hill costs Americans at least $110,490,000 annually just for the privilege of being “represented.” The only thing all that power and money coursing through those snaking hallways buys for us is power and money coursing through those snaking hallways. If you’re looking for representative government, it’s not to be found.

If you’re looking for fealty to the Swamp, however, you’ve come to the right place.

Thus, our elected representatives will keep enforcing the Establishment “narrative,” which thrives on confusion and cover-up. And why not? Republican or Democrat, they are the Establishment.

Here are their core talking points — which, in the tradition of good old fashioned cover-ups, are mainly non-talking points.

The “Russians hacked” the DNC — although there is nada, zip, zero verifiable, official evidence. The unsolved murder of DNC new voter data director Seth Rich, whom Wikileaks Julian Assange has strongly indicated was a Wikileaks source, is a “botched robbery” — if, after what happened to Sean Hannity, the topic ever comes up again. The Obama administration’s Stasi-like spying on Americans (rather more delicately known as “unmasking”) including Gen. Flynn and twenty million other Americans, according to massive documentation alleged to have been copied by a NSA/CIA whistleblower, is a non-event. The provenance and dissemination of the so-called “Russian dossier,” produced by former journalist Glenn Simpson of GPS Fusion at the behest of #NeverTrump Republicans then pro-Hillary Democrats, with a $50,000 bonus offered by the FBI, are of no interest to the American people, either.

Nor is the fact that Simpson, among others, is accused in a complaint filed last summer with the Justice Department by Bill Browder of failing to have registered as a foreign agent of Russia over his company’s role in lobbying against the Magnitsky Act. According to Browder’s complaint, this anti-Magnitsky lobbying program was spearheaded by Natalia Veselnitskaya — the same exact Russian lawyer Donald Trump Jr. wishes he’d never heard of.

Whatever you do, though, if you’re in the US Congress, don’t find out anything more about any of it, and especially not if any of it links together. Sure, “invite” the Susan Rices and Glenn Simpsons to testify about “unmasking” and “dirty dossiers” respectively. Heck, invite the DNC contractors who i.d.’d the “Russian hack” of the DNC servers in the first place (not that the DNC ever permitted the FBI to have a look at the servers to make sure). When these witnesses decline to appear (as these all have), don’t, whatever you do, subpoena them. They might show up. They might say something that would undermine the Big Lies being set in sound bytes for posterity’s history books. We can’t have that. The Swamp wouldn’t like it.

As for witnesses who want to come before Congress’s committees and swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about their highly relevant experiences, such as Carter Page, don’t worry: block them. Or, in Bill Browder’s case, postpone them.

Always remember: In Washington, the way to “get to the bottom of things” is not to ask questions, but to keep diving. There are shiny rewards below."
59,##########,http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/26/sen-grassley-fusion-gps-founder-has-agreed-to-discuss-trump-dossier/,Sen. Grassley: Fusion GPS Founder Has Agreed To Discuss Trump Dossier,[],Daily Caller,"Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley said on Wednesday that the founder of opposition research firm Fusion GPS has agreed to discuss his involvement with the now-infamous Trump dossier as well as his interactions with the FBI.

Grassley made that revelation during his opening remarks at a hearing to discuss the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).

Last week, Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, said through his attorney that he would decline the committee’s invitation to appear at the hearing. Simpson’s lawyer also said that Simpson would plead the Fifth if subpoenaed.

But on Tuesday, the committee agreed to waive its subpoena in exchange for Simpson’s agreement to provide a private, transcribed interview.

Grassley said that he withdrew the subpoena after Simpson agreed to discuss “his involvement in creating the Trump dossier and interactions with the FBI” as well as “his alleged work with the unregistered foreign agents who met with the Trump family and campaign officials.”

Fusion GPS, which Simpson co-founded in 2010 with other Journal reporters, was hired by a GOP donor in Sept. 2015 to conduct research on Trump. By June 2016, the Republican client dropped from the project, and a supporter of Hillary Clinton’s hired the firm to continue its research.

Fusion GPS then hired former British spy Christopher Steele to continue the project. He would go on to write a dossier a 17 separate memos containing various uncorroborated allegations about Trump and members of his campaign.

Grassley has been interested in the dossier because the document was reportedly used by the FBI as part of its investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government. The bureau also reportedly struck an informal agreement to pay Steele $50,000 in order to continue gathering information about Trump. That payments was reportedly never made, though it is unclear why.

Fusion GPS factors into Wednesday’s FARA hearing because of its work last year on a campaign to undermine the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law opposed by the Russian government.

Fusion GPS worked for Denis Katsyv, a Russian businessman who opposed the law, which was passed in 2012.

One Russian national involved in that campaign is Natalia Veselnitskaya, an attorney for Katsyv and one of the people who met with members of the Trump campaign in Trump Tower last June.

Veselnitskaya’s involvement with Fusion GPS and participation in the Trump Tower meeting have led some to question whether there is a connection between the meeting and the dossier.

Though Grassley says that Simpson has agreed to discuss the dossier, he has so far refused to provide information to the Judiciary Committee, including the identity of its clients and its interactions with Steele and the FBI.

“We will also pursue details about Mr. Simpson’s role in both this and the dossier that started the whole controversy. Knowing exactly who is acting on behalf of the Russian government is vital in order to get to the bottom of Russian influence, and any other foreign influence,” Grassley said Wednesday.

Schiff Speculates On &#8216;Quid Pro Quo&#8217; Between Trump Jr. And Russia [VIDEO],[],Daily Caller,"Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intel Committee, speculated Tuesday that Donald Trump Jr. may have had a “quid pro quo” relationship with the Russians.

Responding to questions about Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer in the hopes of obtaining damaging information about Hillary Clinton, Schiff said the meeting may have had additional favors involved.

“One of the messages that this Russian advocate may have taken back to Moscow is that the Trump administration would be very amenable to repealing the Magnitsky Act — that’s a piece of sanctions legislation that goes after Russians who are violating people’s human rights,” Schiff continued.

“So was that a quid pro quo, was that simply further encouragement of the Russians to intervene?” Schiff wondered. “Certainly they were getting all the right signals.”

Schiff’s position on the House Intelligence Committee could indicate that he already knows about a “quid pro quo” relationship, or that he is just speculating at this point.

The Daily Caller reached out to Schiff’s office to determine if his comments were informed by his work on the Intel Committee but did not receive a response in time for publication.

On MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Thursday, Murphy said that “it strains credibility to believe that Donald Trump didn’t know about this meeting.”

Murphy concluded that Trump must be lying “given the fact that some of his closest advisors and family members were inside that meeting.”

Murphy’s comments followed a Reuters interview with President Trump where the president said that he had no knowledge of the Russian meeting.

“No, that I didn’t know until a couple of days ago when I heard about this,” Trump said.

However, the Connecticut senator doesn’t buy Trump’s story. He argued that there is no reason that Americans should believe the story that Donald Trump Jr. is telling, either.

“He lied openly and repeatedly about his contacts with the Russian government,” said Murphy.

Donald Trump Jr. said in a 2016 interview with CNN that Russia had not been behind a hack at the Democratic National Committee in an effort to help Trump. The Intelligence Community later confirmed that Putin had, in fact, ordered an influence campaign aimed at aiding Trump’s presidential win.

“If he’s been lying about it for months and months beforehand, why do we believe all of sudden that he’s telling the truth today?” Murphy concluded."
62,##########,http://dailycaller.com/2017/08/01/ukraine-has-increased-volatility-as-new-russian-sanctions-introduced/,Ukraine Has Increased Volatility As New Russian Sanctions Introduced,[],Daily Caller,"As Vladimir Putin aggressively retaliates to America’s new sanctions against Russia by ordering the American diplomatic mission in Russia to reduce its staff by 755 employees, Ukraine might be facing new immediate threats of another invasion and land grab from the East. Unfortunately since the latest revolution, Ukraine’s own government has become a major source of Western frustration. Despite the talk of reforms and an end to the era of corruption, not much has changed, as reflected by the World Ranking of Corruption Perception. Despite its problematic neighbor, Ukraine has become its own worst enemy. Before the Pentagon and the State Department propose to the White House a plan to supply Ukraine with anti-tank missiles and other arms, as was reported recently, we need to make sure Ukraine’s house is in order first.

Twice I have been fortunate to work with Ukrainian citizens for extended periods. Once was in the 1970s during my days in the U.S. Berlin Brigade, and more recently in Iraq. Under Soviet control, they looked for the day when they did not have to take orders from Moscow. When they became independent, they looked for an opportunity to appear on the world stage.

Seventy years ago Germany and Japan were picking themselves up from total devastation. Twenty years later they were pushing themselves into the global market. Today Germany and Japan are two of the world’s largest economies. Ukraine possesses the necessary resources, has a work force ready to be employed, and is in prime position to become a successful economy. Unfortunately, widespread internal corruption is Ukraine’s biggest obstacle. Instead of dedicating themselves to developing a long-term future, the political and judicial leaders are primarily focused on their own short-term financial gain.

Ukrainian citizens understand this. A survey developed by Ukraine-based Dragon Capital confirmed that the country’s citizens were more concerned about widespread government corruption and a broken judicial system than another attack from Russia. The financial situation is very volatile and prohibits the citizens, as well as potential foreign investors, from knowing what the currency will do from week to week.

Even when foreign investors show potential interest, they are being scared away. The Ukrainian-born Segal brothers is a blatant case in point. Now U.S. citizens operating an investment firm in New York City, the brothers had built a financial stake in the future of their original homeland. Unfortunately, their 50-million-dollar soybean plant was power-grabbed by Ukrainian billionaire Dmitry Firtash (currently waiting to be extradited to the USA from Austria to face a corruption trial). Fraud, extortion, physical threats were all tools used by Firtash.

When the Segal brothers turned to the Ukrainian government to make things right in 2010, Firtash and his business partners had the courts and police under their control. Firtash used intimate connections to the Government and the Ministry of Interior to submit a request to Interpol to arrest the Segals. After a few recent legal victories during President Poroshenko’s time, the Segals are still struggling to get full control of the plant as allegedly Sergei Levochkin (former head of the Yanukovich Administration) and lawmakers Oleksandr Granovsky and Ivan Fursin managed to capture the judicial system. The situation in Ukraine is so bad even its own Prime Minister recently stated: “The weakest link in our fight against corruption is the Ukrainian court.” The Firtash partners allegedly control a significant fraction of the “opposition block” in the Parliament, and the country’s leadership is forced to conduct a politics of compromise and concession, given the financial strength of its backers.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and other U.S. officials for some time have been pushing Ukraine to press ahead with reforms that would curb corruption and improve governmental transparency.

Ukrainian leaders are not only robbing the citizens of financial stability, they are robbing the citizens of their future. Parallels with what the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development stated: “While the political and security situation has deteriorated in recent years, the problems are long-term and have to do with poor business environment, weak institutions, and widespread corruption.”

Investors are willing to take some risk. That is the nature of their business. They are not willing to invest in a guaranteed failure. That is what Ukraine is offering right now. To encourage foreign investment, the environment must change – starting with judicial and business reform. Situations such as what happened to the Segal brothers must be stopped, and that travesty reversed.

Meanwhile, the systematic failure of Ukraine to protect western investors will trigger economic and personal sanctions against individuals and institutions involved. Ukraine will need US government support to build its future and defend its borders. Supporting crimes committed against US investors and proving the government of Ukraine cannot be trusted are guaranteed to alienate the US Congress and State Department.

Prime Minister Groysman came into his office pledging to fight corruption. Taking him at his word, the Ukrainian people and government officials need to get behind him and fix the problems, which are at the level of severe international embarrassment. Organized crime and government corruption can be overcome.

My experience with Ukrainians assures me reformers are immediately available to them. Backed Prime Minister Groysman, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, special legislation similar to our Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), could clean up that entire broken system if this act is enforced with the right people behind it.

Until the Government of Ukraine successfully takes aggressive action to fix itself, it is guaranteed to retain its designation of one the world’s most corrupt governments. Meanwhile, its own citizens will remain the biggest victims.

That’s according to a new report by The New York Times, which reveals that Rinat Akhmetshin has worked for clients with close ties to the Kremlin and has forged a working relationship with Viktor Ivanov, a former KGB officer and close associate of Vladimir Putin’s.

Akhmetshin, a Washington, D.C.-based political operative, was one of four Russians who attended a June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

That meeting is of interest to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government. According to The Times, Mueller is also interested in Akhmetshin’s role in the meeting.

Akmethshin, 49, attended the meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer who was representing Denis Katsyv, a Russian businessman who faced sanctions under the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law that blacklists Russians accused of human rights abuses. (RELATED: Here’s What We Know About Rinat Akhmetshin)

Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin were also working with Fusion GPS on the project. Fusion GPS is the opposition research firm that hired former British spy Christopher Steele to investigate Donald Trump’s activities in Russia.

The involvement of Akhmetshin and Fusion GPS in the anti-Magnitsky project has raised questions about whether any information about the Trump Tower meeting somehow ended up in the uncorroborated and salacious Steele dossier. The Daily Caller has been told by a source who knows both Akhmetshin and the founder of Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, that the two operatives “run in the same circles” in the seedy world of Washington, D.C. opposition research.

Ken Vogel, a Times reporter who co-bylined the latest piece on Akhmetshin, has previously tweeted that Akhmetshin and Simpson have served as sources for one another in the past. Simpson was a reporter at The Wall Street Journal until 2009, when he left to start a private research firm.

Akhmetshin has downplayed the significance of the Trump Tower meeting, claiming that he attended with Veselnitskaya on a whim after bumping into her during a visit to New York City.

The meeting is of interest to investigators because Trump Jr. accepted it after being offered damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

Trump Jr. accepted the meeting after being told by an acquaintance that a “Russian government attorney” — Veselnitskaya — would be providing the information. He was also told that it came from Russia’s top prosecutor. Trump critics have argued that the meeting could constitute collusion. The White House has said that no useful information about Clinton was provided and that there was no collusion.

Trump Jr.’s explanation for taking the meeting has shifted several times. He initially claimed that he and Veselnitskaya discussed Russia’s policies regarding adoptions by American citizens. Putin prohibited adoptions by Americans as retaliation for passage of the Magnitsky Act, which he strongly opposes.

But Russian operatives like Akhmetshin who have lobbied U.S. lawmakers — most notably, California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher — have used the adoption issue as a ruse to undercut the Magnistky Act.

Akhmetshin has a history of helping other pro-Kremlin efforts.

According to The Times, Akhmetshin forged a relationship with Ivanov, the former director of Russia’s Federal Narcotics Services, and, in Oct. 2010, chauffeured him around Washington, D.C. to promote a project he was working on at the time.

Akhmetshin said in an affidavit filed in a court case that he had exchanged emails with Ivanov discussing topics ranging “from narco-trafficking and terrorism in Afghanistan to surveillance of undercover agents, suspected undercover agents and their identities.”

In 2005, the government of Krygyzstan hired Akhmetshin to investigate whether the U.S. government had bribed the former president of the ex-Soviet republic in order to build an air base that was used as a staging group for the war in Afghanistan.

The campaign to discredit the Manas air base was seen as beneficial to the Russian government, which opposed a strong American presence in the region. After an extensive public relations campaign, Krygyzstan closed the base in 2014.

Akhmetshin has also been involved in at least two projects which involved alleged hacking of the lobbyist’s adversaries.

According to The Times, Akhmetshin was working for a group affiliated with Suleiman Kerimov, a Russian businessman with close ties to Putin. Kerimov was in a business dispute with a competitor named Ashot Egiazaryan.

In 2011, Egiazaryan’s London-based legal team received two emails containing spyware that traced back to computer servers registered to Kerimov’s offices in Moscow. Akhmetshin was not directly implicated in the hacking scheme, though he has said in court affidavits that he was paid by Kerimov. Akhmetshin also helped plant negative news stories about Egiazaryan, who sought asylum in the U.S. because of his conflicts with Putin’s government.

Akhmetshin was directly accused of hacking two years later, in a dispute involving EuroChem, a fertilizer company controlled by Russian businessman Andrey Melnichenko.

EuroChem was in a dispute with International Mineral Resources (IMR), a competitor.

Akhmetshin, who was working for a law firm hired by EuroChem, said in a court deposition that he obtained documents stolen from IMR’s computer systems through something called the “London information bazaar.”

He obtained a thumb drive containing documents stolen from IMR and passed it to an Israeli businessman during a meeting in London.

Akhmetshin denied being involved in the hacking of the documents. The lawsuit against him and EuroChem was dropped last year, with International Mineral Resources withdrawing its allegations altogether.

Akhmetshin has denied allegations that he is a Russian government operative or a Kremlin spy. According to The Times, he did not respond to repeated requests for comment. He has also not responded to numerous emails and phone calls placed by The Daily Caller.

In his Washington Post op-ed titled “Bungled collusion is still collusion,” Krauthammer said he had been puzzled by the claims that President Donald Trump and the White House had been colluding with Russia, due to the fact there was no solid evidence. However, when Donald Trump Jr. released a chain of emails Tuesday, Krauthammer believed that pushed the Russia scandal into a new phase, one from which it will be impossible for Trump to recover.

“The evidence is now shown. This is not hearsay, not fake news, not unsourced leaks. This is an email chain released by Donald Trump Jr. himself,” Krauthammer said. (RELATED: Emails Show Trump Jr. Knew Information May Have Come From Russian Government)

Both Trump Jr. and Natalia Veselnitskaya, the lawyer involved in the correspondence, have denied that any damaging information was shared during their meeting.

“What matters is what Donald Jr. thought going into the meeting, as well as Jared Kushner and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort, who were forwarded the correspondence, invited to the meeting, and attended,” Krauthammer said. “There is no statute against helping a foreign hostile power meddle in an American election. What Donald Jr. — and Kushner and Manafort — did may not be criminal. But it is not merely stupid … it is also deeply wrong, a fundamental violation of any code of civic honor.”

Krauthammer said he would leave it to the lawyers to decide the legality of Trump Jr.’s emails and the meeting.

“You don’t need a lawyer to see that the Trump defense — collusion as a desperate Democratic fiction designed to explain away a lost election — is now officially dead,” Krauthammer concluded.

Trump Jr.’s tweet comes in response to Sen. Susan Collins’ claim that the committee “needs to interview him and others who attended the meeting.”

“Happy to work with the committee to pass on what I know,” Trump Jr. tweeted.

Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort attended a meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in June 2016, according to a report by the New York Times. The lawyer allegedly had ties to the Kremlin and had claimed to have information that could damage then president candidate Hillary Clinton.

The meeting is believed to be the first confirmed private meeting with Trump’s closest advisors and a Russian national, according to TheNYT. Congressional investigations into the allegations that the campaign colluded with Russia are ongoing, as is the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller.

Mueller’s investigators are trying to determine what role Trump played in crafting Don Jr.’s initial response to a July New York Times report that revealed Don Jr. met with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya and former Soviet intelligence officer Rinat Akhmetshin, three sources familiar with the investigation told NBC News. The meeting, which occurred in June 2016 at Trump Tower in New York, was also attended by Trump’s son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

In his initial response to the report, which Trump admitted he “weighed in” on, Don Jr. described the encounter as a “short introductory meeting” held to discuss American-Russian adoption policy. The Washington Post reported that Trump “dictated” the response.

The following day TheNYTimes reported that the meeting was sold to Don Jr. as an opportunity to obtain damaging information on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. The NYTimes account was later confirmed when Don Jr. released an email exchange in which publicist Rob Goldstone told him that a Russian lawyer “offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary [Clinton] … and would be very useful to your father.”

“If it’s what you say, I love it,” Don Jr. responded. He began making arrangements for the meeting the following day.

Federal investigators are currently exploring whether Trump “knowingly made a false statement,” a source familiar with the investigation told NBC News.

“Even if Trump is not charged with a crime as a result of the statement, it could be useful to Mueller’s team to show Trump’s conduct to a jury that may be considering other charges,” the source said.

“These emails are textbook evidence of criminal intent. It is a bombshell for this investigation because the most difficult element of any crime is criminal intent to prove, and it will lead to numerous other avenues of investigation and probably indicates many other meetings,” Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal told The Daily Caller Wednesday.

“If he is charged and convicted, there certainly is potential for criminal prison time,” added Blumenthal, the former attorney general of his home state.

Blumenthal made this remark one day after Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine claimed that the Russia investigation may be moving toward treason.

“We are now beyond obstruction of justice,” Kaine told CNN Tuesday. “This is moving into perjury, false statements and even potentially treason.”

Trump Jr. Tuesday tweeted a series of emails between himself and an acquaintance who helped arrange a meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Trump Jr. said the meeting amounted to nothing and that Veselnitskaya, who was not a government official, wanting to talk about the Magnitsky Act.

Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley stated that Trump Jr.’s emails were a “powerful concrete example of coordination with the with the Russians,” but when asked about possible prison time, Merkley responded he would leave that issue to the “legal side.”

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin told TheDC that it would be “wrong to say that at this point in the investigation” whether Trump Jr. deserves prison time, adding that further investigation is necessary and that there are “a lot more questions” now.

“Well, they confirmed that there was some kind of reception and dialogue between representatives of Russia, either official or unofficial, in the Trump campaign,” Durbin told TheDC.

He went on to say, “Certainly, they put their heads together to try to help the Trump campaign. I mean, that was the purpose of the meeting stated in the emails. So, there’s nothing you would dispute about that, but taking that to the level of criminality, that really takes a lot more. It takes more information and, you know, the prosecutorial decision by Mueller and others.”

According to the network, Mueller’s investigators are planning to talk to the man about the June 9, 2016, meeting, which was hosted by Donald Trump Jr.

So far, seven meeting attendees have been identified, but the eighth person’s identity is being withheld by his attorney and the lawyer for Trump Jr.

“The eighth person has been identified by prosecutors and we are cooperating fully with prosecutors as a result of the investigation. To preserve the integrity of the investigation we are declining to identify him at this time,” Scott Balber, the man’s attorney, told CNN.

The man is a U.S. citizen and is described as a representative for the Agalarovs, a Russian-Azerbaijani billionaire family which has done business with the Trump family in the past.

The Trump Tower meeting was set up after Rob Goldstone, a publicist for Emin Agalarov, a pop musician, contacted Trump Jr. offering up opposition research on Hillary Clinton.

Goldstone said that a “Russian government lawyer” would provide the information. Trump Jr. accepted the offer and the two hammered out details for the meeting.

The lawyer was identified earlier this month as Natalia Veselnitskaya. She was accompanied by a translator named Anatoli Samochornov and a Russian-American lobbyist named Rinat Akhmetshin.

Trump Jr. was accompanied by his brother-in-law, Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

Balber, who is also representing the Agalarov family and has represented Trump in the past, said that his new client believed that he would be attending the meeting in order to translate for Veselnitskaya, who does not speak English.

Lawyers working for President Trump still do not know the identity of the man, a source close to the matter told The Daily Caller.

Balber and Trump Jr.’s lawyer, Alan Futerfas, have not returned several requests for comment.

Dianne Feinstein, who is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, says the testimony of financier William Browder to the committee about Russia’s influence peddling in the United States was the “best” she has heard on the matter.

Browder testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Wednesday about Foreign Agents Registration Act enforcement in relation to the committee’s larger Russia investigation.

“I thought it was some of the best testimony I’ve ever heard. As a matter of fact, I just had another call with him this afternoon. He spoke, I thought, comprehensively without a note without a stammer and it’s obvious that his knowledge is extraordinary,” Feinstein told The Daily Caller.

Browder testified that Fusion GPS, the firm that created the infamous dossier on Donald Trump, had acted on behalf of Russian interests to repeal the Magnitsky Act, legislation which financially hurt Vladimir Putin and his associates.

The law is named after murdered Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who defended Browder when the American financier became the target of the Putin regime while living in Moscow. Browder described how Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, the same attorney that met with Donald Trump Jr. last year, used Fusion GPS to conduct a smear campaign against him.

“Veselnitskaya, through Baker Hostetler, hired Glenn Simpson of the firm Fusion GPS to conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of congressional hearings on the Global Magnitsky Act. He contacted a number of major newspapers and other publications to spread false information that Sergei Magnitsky was not murdered, was not a whistle-blower, and was instead a criminal. They also spread false information that my presentations to lawmakers around the world were untrue,” Browder said in his written testimony.

Browder added, “As part of Veselnitskaya’s lobbying, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, Chris Cooper of the Potomac Group, was hired to organize the Washington, D.C.-based premiere of a fake documentary about Sergei Magnitsky and myself. This was one the best examples of Putin’s propaganda.”

Although Democrats are not talking much about the various Russia investigations on Capitol Hill, Feinstein insists that the Judiciary Committee’s Russia investigation is not winding down and she expects to hear from former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort in September.

“It’s certainly very active in intelligence. There have been a lot of interviews done. And Judiciary is gearing up. We’re asking some documents this month one’s from Donald Trump and Manafort and we understand they are beginning to give us documents August 2,” she said. “And we’re grateful for that answer and we hope to have him before us in September.”

The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that Kaveladze, a U.S. citizen, attended the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting, ending nearly four days of speculation about the mystery man’s identity.

Lawyers for Donald Trump Jr., who set up the meeting, had declined for days to identify the eighth person even though the existence of an unnamed attendee was reported on Friday. The Daily Caller was told as of early Tuesday morning that President Trump’s lawyers were unaware of the man’s name.

Kaveladze, who has residences in the U.S. but splits time in Moscow, is said to have attended the meeting on behalf of Aras Agalarov, a Russian-Azerbaijani real estate mogul who has done business with the Trump family in the past.

Kaveladze is a vice president at Agalarov’s firm, Crocus Group.

The meeting was set up after President Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was approached by an acquaintance offering opposition research on Hillary Clinton.

Rob Goldstone, a publicist for Aras Agalarov’s pop musician son, Emin, told Trump Jr. that a “Russian government attorney” would be providing the information.

That attorney, Natalia Veselnitskaya, brought with her a translator and a Russian-American lobbyist who some U.S. officials believe is connected to Russian intelligence.

Trump Jr.’s lawyer and an attorney for the Agalarov family withheld the name of the mystery attendee until Tuesday. Scott Balber, an attorney for the family, is also representing Kaveladze. He has also represented Trump in the past.

Balber told CNN earlier on Tuesday that investigators working for Special Counsel Robert Mueller had identified his client.

Mueller is expected to speak to all eight of the people in the meeting to determine whether members of the Trump campaign attempted to collude with the Russian government during the presidential campaign. Trump’s critics have said that the meeting constituted collusion. His defenders have argued that any political campaign would had a meeting in which dirt on an opponent was offered.

Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort were also in the meeting.

Kaveladze has a prominent social media presence, including several blogs and Twitter accounts.

He claims to have started working for Crocus Group in 2004.

“As Senior Vice President, Irakly Kaveladze directly represents the company in a wide range of international projects and oversees professionals including engineers, architects, interior decorators, and designers,” a bio on one of his blogs reads.

That blog also says that Kaveladze was educated at the Moscow Finance Academy, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in accounting and economics. He earned an MBA at the University of New Haven in Connecticut in 2002.

Kaveladze also lists himself in other biographies as a member of the U.S.-Russia Business Council. That group did not return a request seeking information about his membership.

One item not listed on Kaveladze’s resume is his alleged involvement in suspected money laundering activity during the 1990s.

In 2000, The New York Times reported that the Government Accounting Office found that Kaveladze had set up 2,000 shell companies registered in Delaware on behalf of Russian brokers. Kaveladze, who was born in the country of Georgia and came to the U.S. in 1991, opened up bank accounts for the brokers, whose identities he did not know.

More than $800 million from 136 accounts set up by Kaveladze was wired from overseas to 136 accounts.

The GAO report did not investigate Kaveladze for any criminal wrongdoing, and he dismissed the allegations in the report as part of a “witch hunt.”

Balber did not respond to requests seeking comment on the allegations made in the GAO report. He has said that his client has no affiliation with the Russian government. Kaveladze did not respond to emails and phone calls seeking comment.

Manafort’s notes, which he surrendered to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, contain the word “donations” and “RNC” in close proximity to each other, two sources briefed on the information told NBC News Thursday. One source described the notes, recorded on Manafort’s smartphone, as “cryptic.” (RELATED: Manafort Memo Raises New Questions About Trump Tower Meeting)

Trump Jr. and Manafort met with Russian lobbyists Natalia Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin in June 2016 to obtain damaging information related former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators are focusing on the meeting in an effort to determine whether contributions to the RNC were discussed, as foreign political donations are federally illegal.

“It is 100 percent false to suggest this meeting included any discussion of donations from Russian sources to either the Trump campaign or the Republican Party. Mr. Manafort provided the Senate Intelligence Committee with the facts and his notes so this speculation and conjecture is pointless and wrong,” Manafort’s spokesman Jason Maloni told NBC News.

Akhmetshin, a political operative and former Soviet intelligence officer, testified in early August in front of a Washington, D.C. grand jury empaneled by Mueller.

Trump Jr., Manafort and Veselnitskaya have maintained that the Magnitsky Act, a Russia human rights sanctions bill, was the sole topic of conversation during the meeting.

Mueller’s investigators have become keenly interested in Trump’s knowledge of the meeting and whether he tried to conceal the meeting’s purpose.

Chuck Grassley of Iowa Wednesday afternoon to express support for ethanol, a corn based biofuel that provides a boon to Iowa’s agricultural economy.

Trump’s call comes one day after his son, Donald Trump Jr., agreed to appear before Grassley’s Senate Committee on the Judiciary to discuss a June 2016 meeting he admittedly attended in order to obtain damaging information about the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign from a Russian lawyer.

Just had ph call from Pres Trump + he assured me he’s pro ethanol +I’m free 2 the ppl of Iowa he’s standing by his campaign PROMISE — ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) August 30, 2017

Tlkd 2 @realDonaldTrump about ethanol +he knows that ethanol is good good good — ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) August 30, 2017

Oil lobbyists have squared off with Iowa’s corn industry since Trump’s election over exactly what percentage of the nation’s fuel supply should be comprised of ethanol. The battle pits the corn lobby against entrenched oil interests, who reject the EPA’s renewable fuel standards as burdensome government interference.

During the campaign, Trump vowed to help Iowa’s ethanol industry, which he described as “under siege” during a June speech in Grand Rapids. The Trump administration has seemingly balanced this campaign pledge against the interests of oil refineries by proposing 2018 renewable fuel standards that maintain the 15 billion gallon ethanol requirement mandated in the 2017 standards. This move defied the existing trend, as renewable fuel standards have increased the ethanol threshold every year since their inception in 2014.

The Senate Committee on the Judiciary settled on a date for Trump Jr. to privately testify as to the contents of his June 2016 meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya on Tuesday. While the exact date has not yet been released, Trump Jr. will appear in “the next few weeks,” a source familiar with the matter told Politico. He was called to publicly testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in July but countered by offering to be interviewed privately and provide documents to the committee.

The committee’s leaders, Grassley and Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, vowed in July to compel Trump Jr. and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to appear in a public hearing under threat of a subpoena, if necessary. The pair agreed, however, to allow Trump Jr. and Manafort to appear privately ahead of any public hearing.

In Filipov’s piece, he reports that some news outlets have described Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. as “Kremlin-connected,” but he writes that phrasing is “imprecise.” He explains that “Veselnitskaya does not work for the Russian government … she is a successful lawyer in the Moscow Oblast,” a region near Moscow but not in Moscow itself. Veselnitskaya “formerly worked in the local prosecutor’s office.”

In an interview with The Washington Post Tuesday, Veselnitskaya denied working for the Russian government saying “I am in shock. I’m just an ordinary person. A regional prosecutor is not the Kremlin.”

A Bloomberg report Tuesday described “The regional elites” like Veselnitskaya as “several notches below the Kremlin level,” which explains the “snobbish” reaction from Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, about Veselnitskaya:

“No, we don’t know who that is, we cannot follow all the meetings of all the Russian lawyers both inside the country and overseas,” he said.

Veselnitskaya is not a “Russian government lawyer” or a “Kremlin lawyer.” Her Russian ties stem from her opposition to U.S. sanctions, and her fierce efforts to repeal the Magnitsky Act — American imposed sanctions on Russia for human rights violations.

The lawyers meeting with Donald Trump Jr. was billed as an opportunity to acquire “sensitive information” from a “Russian government attorney” incriminating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in her dealings with Russia. Reports indicate that she had no information about Clinton, and instead talked about her opposition to the Magintsky Act.

Warner and Schiff’s Sunday morning comments indicated the meeting strays more into “immoral” rather than “illegal” territory.

California Rep. Schiff said on ABC’s “This Week” that he believes the meeting is “clear evidence” of “intent by the campaign to collude with the Russians.”

“This is about as clear evidence you could find of intent by the campaign to collude with the Russians. To get useful information from the Russians,” Schiff said.

Schiff described a quid pro quo relationship between Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer in the meeting, which could be illegal, but Schiff seems to be only speculating at this point. (VIDEO: Rep. Schiff Speculates On ‘Quid Pro Quo’ Between Trump Jr. And Russia)

“If there’s any kind of understanding that comes out of that meeting, ‘you get us the dirt, you start leaking dirt on Hillary Clinton, and we will look favorably on repealing the Magnitsky Act,’ that’s a very serious crime,” Schiff opined.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the committee, made the decision to postpone the hearing, which was scheduled for Wednesday.

It is not entirely clear why the hearing is being postponed, though one of the main witnesses, Glenn Simpson, the opposition researcher behind the dossier, was reportedly planning to skip the event.

A spokesperson for the committee said that the hearing is being postponed as Grassley and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein work to schedule additional witnesses and obtain relevant documents.

The committee did not say whether Simpson will be subpoenaed.

Grassley has pressed Simpson and his firm, Fusion GPS, about its involvement in the dossier, which was prepared by former British spy Christopher Steele. Fusion GPS hired Steele after being hired by a Democratic ally of Hillary Clinton’s to investigate Trump’s ties to Russia.

Wednesday’s two-part hearing was to focus on failures in the Foreign Agents Registration Act, the law which requires lobbyists and consultants working for foreign governments to disclose their activities.

Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, was invited to take part in a second panel along with Bill Browder, a London-based financier who helped push through the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions bill passed in 2012.

Last year, well before Simpson’s involvement in the dossier was known, Browder filed a complaint with the Justice Department alleging that the opposition researcher failed to properly file under FARA.

Fusion GPS had been hired to conduct opposition research against Browder as part of a lobbying campaign against the Magnitsky Act, which is named after Browder’s attorney, Sergei Magnitsky.

The Russian government vehemently opposes the bill, which blacklists Russian businessmen involved in human rights abuses.

Browder’s work on the Magnitsky Act, and his FARA complaint, have received renewed attention following the publication of the Steele dossier as well as the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting.

Three of the attendees in that meeting were named in Browder’s complaint.

They are Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer, Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist and former Soviet military officer, and Anatolia Samochornov, a translator who worked as a State Department contractor until September.

The three Russians were affiliated with a non-profit group called the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation (HRAGIF).

The group claimed to be an advocate for U.S. adoptions of Russian children, which were blocked by Russian president Vladimir Putin as retaliation for the Magnitsky Act. But in reality, the group and its trio of operatives, were interested in rolling back Magnitsky.

Browder told The Daily Caller in January, just after the dossier was published by BuzzFeed, that he questioned the veracity of the document because of Simpson’s involvement.

The overlap between the dossier and the anti-Magnitsky push has led some Trump supporters to question whether the Trump Tower meeting was an attempt to set up or compromise the Trump campaign.

Donald Trump Jr. agreed to the meeting after being told by an acquaintance that he would be provided with derogatory information about Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. was told that the information was being provided with the backing of the Russian government and by a “Russian government attorney.”

A lawyer for Fusion GPS has said that the firm was not aware of the meeting before it took place.

After it was reported on Friday that a suspected former Soviet intelligence officer attended the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting, a mad dash is on to find out more about the man, Rinat Akhmetshin.

A naturalized American citizen, Akhmetshin is often cited as a lobbyist, but details about his activities in Washington, D.C. portray him as something more.

NBC News first reported that a suspected former Soviet intelligence officer accompanied Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya to the meeting. Akhmetshin later confirmed to the Associated Press that he attended.

He is a well-connected political operative who works closely with Washington, D.C. reporters by providing opposition research on behalf of his clients. He has also formed several small non-profit groups aimed at advancing the interests of Russian clients and others from Soviet satellite nations.

In a 2015 legal filing, a lawyer who worked with Akhmetshin described him as “a recognized expert on business and political matters in Kazakhstan, Russia and other former Soviet countries.”

That lawyer, Patrick Salisbury, also stated that Akhmetshin has “a wide network of connections in those circles as well as in the media.”

Salisbury denied the main allegation made in that lawsuit, that Akhmetshin had orchestrated a hack of the computer systems of a mining company called International Mineral Resources. Salisbury and Akhmetshin worked for a business rival of that firm’s called EuroChem.

Salisbury said he had never heard Akhmetshin discuss hacking or any other “improper data gathering,” and Akhmetshin denied the charge, though he did say that he obtained documents from IMR through seemingly shady means.

Akhmetshin acknowledged that he obtained the IMR documents through something called the London information bazaar, an information exchange network used by journalists, investigators and operatives.

Akhmetshin said in the May 2015 deposition, which was obtained by The Daily Caller, that he gave a memory stick containing IRM documents to an Israeli businessman during a Jan. 30, 2014 meeting at a London coffee shop.

The lobbyist-operative also has deep contacts to Washington, D.C. and international media outlets. Salisbury said that Akhmetshin frequently worked with the Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and the Guardian.

He also said that Akhmetshin worked with Global Witness, an anti-corruption watchdog group he described as being “funded by George Soros and others.”

Akhmetshin “obtains research information” from the Soros-backed group, Salisbury said.

As part of the IMR-EuroChem lawsuit, Akhmetshin was ordered to provide a list of people he emailed with as part of his work on that case. The list includes reporters from The Guardian, Harper’s magazine, and other outlets.

IMR dropped the case last year, withdrawing its allegation that EuroChem and Akhmetshin hacked the firm’s computers.

Akhmetshin was also identified as the force behind a smear campaign waged against Ashot Egiazaryan, a former deputy for the Russian Duma.

In 2011, Egiazaryan accused Akhmetshin of spreading rumors and false stories to reporters in order to prevent him from obtaining political asylum in the U.S.

Egiazaryan sought asylum because he faced criminal charges related to a business dealing involving a Russian billionaire.

RadioFreeEurope reported extensively on that legal case.

He has also formed or been linked to at least three small non-profit groups that deal with issues related to Russia or former Soviet nation. He founded the Azeri Democracy Initiative Foundation and Kazakhstan 21st Century Foundation, according to lobbying records filed with Congress.

He is also a registered lobbyist for the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation (HRAGIF).

It was with Natalia Veselnitskaya, an associate of HRAGIF, that Akhmetshin attended the Trump Tower meeting.

That meeting was attended by Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

Emails released by Trump Jr. show that he agreed to the meeting after being promised that he would be provided with negative information about Hillary Clinton.

Akhmetshin told the Associated Press that Trump Jr. asked about the information, which Veselnitskaya ended up not providing. He also said that Veselnitskaya brought documents with her to the meeting, but he said he did not know what information was in those documents or whether she gave them to the Trump team.

HRAGIF was formed last year under the auspices of ending Russia’s ban against U.S. citizens adopting children.

Russian president Vladimir Putin enacted the ban in retaliation for passage of the Magnitsky Act in 2012. That law allows for sanctions to be placed against Russians accused of human rights abuses.

Politico and The Daily Beast reported last year that Akhmetshin was seen on Capitol Hill meeting with U.S. lawmakers to lobby against the Magnitsky Act. Former Democratic California Rep. Ron Dellums was also hired onto the lobbying effort. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Oppo Researcher Behind Trump Dossier Took Part In Pro-Kremlin Lobbying Effort)

California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican who has praised Putin in the past, has acknowledged meeting with Akhmetshin. CNN also reported earlier this year that Rohrabacher and Akhmetshin were spotted meeting in Berlin.

Akhmetshin and Veselnitskaya have another strange connection.

Also involved in the anti-Magnitsky lobbying push was Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm behind the uncorroborated dossier alleging various misdeeds by President Trump and members of his campaign.

Fusion GPS was hired by a law firm called BakerHostetler to investigate Bill Browder, the London-based financier lobbied heavily to pass the Magnitsky Act.

Sergei Magnitsky, the namesake for the law, was Browder’s lawyer. He died in a Russian prison in 2009 after being arrested while investigating a $230 million money laundering scheme that targeted Browder’s operations in Russia.

Veselnitskaya’s client is Denis Katsyv. His firm, Prevezon Holdings, was implicated in the scheme.

The entire complex swirl of operatives — Akhmetshin, Fusion, and Steele — have recently drawn the attention of Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley.

Grassley is set to hold a hearing next week regarding the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Browder will appear at that hearing as a witness. Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of Fusion GPS, was invited to the hearing but will reportedly decline to appear. (RELATED: Senate Panel To Hear Testimony From Businessman Targeted By Trump Dossier Firm)

Fusion GPS has denied knowing about the Veselnitskaya/Akhmetshin meeting at Trump Tower.

Akhmetshin has denied that he is affiliated with Russia’s intelligence agencies. But Browder says he doesn’t buy that claim.

“What this shows is that the Russian government was using intelligence assets like Rinat to run a highly resourced, very aggressive campaign to influence US policy to remove sanctions on Rusian torturers and murderers,” Browder told TheDC of the revelation that Akhmetshin was involved in the Trump Tower meeting.

Browder said that while he cannot speak to what was said in the Trump Tower meeting, he noted that Soviet and Russian intelligence agents are “highly trained in creating incentives for people to do what they want them to do.”

Akhmetshin is also a regular attendee at the Halifax International Security Forum.

That happens to be the same conference where Arizona Sen. John McCain was first told of the Steele dossier. Sir Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Russia and a business associate of Steele’s, discussed the dossier with McCain and one of his longtime associates, a former State Department official named David Kramer.

Kramer flew to England to obtain the dossier from Steele. He gave it to McCain, who provided a copy to then-FBI Director James Comey during a meeting in December.

There is no indication that McCain and Akhmetshin met at the conference.

Dana Rohrabacher from his position on the committee after revelations of his connections to pro-Russian lobbyists.

Paul Behrends served as staff director for Rohrabacher’s Foreign Affairs subcommittee. He was reportedly fired at the recommendation of Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce.

“Paul Behrends no longer works at the committee,” a Foreign Affairs committee spokesperson told the Atlantic on Wednesday evening.

Behrends and Rohrabacher went on a trip to Moscow in 2016 where the congressman received materials critical of the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law which sanctioned Russian officials believed to be involved in the death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who was investigating tax fraud within the Russian government. The meeting sparked concern from embassy officials who warned Rohrabacher and Behrends about the presence of Russian intelligence at the meeting.

Behrends had allegedly been a point of contact on Capitol Hill for Russia lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and Soviet intelligence officer-turned lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, according to a Politico report. Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin’s meeting with Donald Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in June 2016 is now a point of controversy in the ongoing investigation into the campaign’s possible connections to Russia.

Many have criticized Rohrabacher for views that some see as friendly towards Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.

Rohrabacher praised Behrends in a statement to Politico in response to the news.

“Paul Behrends has done a terrific job for me and the committee,” said Rohrabacher. “I have not been told anything to the contrary. I am looking forward to discussing this with the committee leadership. I am sure we will work this out.”

Trump Jr. met with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer in June of 2016 with the understanding that she had damaging information related to Russian support for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.

Trump’s lawyer, Jay Sekulow, offered the Secret Service’s vetting of the meeting as evidence of the benign nature of the encounter.

“Well, I wonder why the Secret Service, if this was nefarious, why the Secret Service allowed these people in. The president had Secret Service protection at that point, and that raised a question with me,” Sekulow said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”

Secret Service spokesman Mason Brayman rejected Sekulow’s statements Sunday, pointing out that Trump Jr. was not under Secret Service protection at the time of the meeting.

“Donald Trump, Jr. was not a protectee of the USSS in June, 2016. Thus we would not have screened anyone he was meeting with at that time,” Brayman told Reuters.

Trump Jr. released an email exchange between him and an intermediary who arranged the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. The exchange clearly shows Trump Jr. met with the Russian lawyer, who was then in the midst of a pro-Russia lobbying campaign, in order to obtain damaging information on Clinton.

Trump has denied having any knowledge of the meeting and Trump Jr. maintains Veselnitskaya did not produce any information related to Clinton.

Also invited to testify in the open session are Glenn Simpson, the head of the firm behind the dossier of anti-Trump research compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, and Bill Browder, a London-based hedge fund manager.

The stated purpose of the hearing is to explore failures in the Foreign Agents Registration Act, though the event will likely include discussions about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting and the Steele dossier.

Browder and Simpson had been scheduled to appear at a hearing that was initially slated for this Wednesday, but it was abruptly cancelled on Tuesday after the committee decided to add additional witnesses and obtain additional documents.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller reportedly gave the green light to the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday to interview Trump Jr. and Manafort in a public setting.

Trump Jr. and Manafort are of interest to the committee because of their June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian attorney who Trump Jr. was informed would be providing opposition research about Hillary Clinton.

Browder and Simpson became embroiled in the fallout over that meeting because the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was lobbying in the U.S. at the time against the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law that blacklists Russians accused of human rights abuses.

Simpson, the co-founder of Fusion GPS, worked in coordination with Veselnitskaya on that lobbying campaign, which was financed by a Russian businessman who hoped to avoid sanctions.

Simpson was hired to investigate Browder, whose lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, is the namesake for the sanctions bill. Browder is the leading activist behind passage of the Magnitsky Act in the U.S. and other Western nations.

Last July, Browder filed a complaint with the Justice Department accusing Veselnitskaya, Simpson and others of failing to properly file as foreign agents under FARA.

The same month of the Trump Tower meeting, Simpson and Fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele to begin researching Trump’s activities in Russia. Steele would go on to produce a 35-page dossier full of salacious but uncorroborated allegations.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has questioned Fusion GPS over its involvement in the dossier, which the FBI has reportedly used as a source document for part of its investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.

Grassley has called the dossier a political document because Fusion GPS was working last year for a supporter of Hillary Clinton’s.

So far, Browder is the only one of the four invitees who have committed to appear at the Senate hearing.

Last week it was reported that Simpson planned to skip the hearing scheduled for this week. It is also not known whether Trump Jr. and Manafort will attend.

A spokesman for Manafort said that the invitation was being reviewed. Trump Jr.’s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Investigators are reportedly looking to question Rhona Graff, a senior vice president at the Trump Organization, for her possible role in the 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower, although Graff was not personally on the email chain.

Graff has worked for the Trump Organization for more than 30 years, and was mentioned in the email chain between publicist Rob Goldstone and Trump Jr. “I can also send this info to your father via Rhona,” Goldstone wrote to Trump Jr. in the email, “but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.”

“Since her name is in the email, people will want her to answer questions,” said New York Republican Rep. Peter King, a member of the House Intelligence Committee who also knows Graff, according to ABC News. “If you go into Trump Tower, you’re going to mention her name.”

Graff was reportedly in charge of communication between Trump and his associates. “Everybody knows in order to get through to him they have to go through me, so they are always on their best behavior,” Graff told Real Estate Weekly in 2004. Politico also dubbed Graff “the gate-keeper at Trump Tower for a quarter century,” due to her long working relationship with Trump.

When asked if he would seek an interview with Graff, North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr responded, “The Committee has cast and will continue to cast a wide net,” according to ABC News. (RELATED: Emails Show Trump Jr. Knew Information May Have Come From Russian Government)

Attorney Alan Futerfas, who serves as outside counsel that represents the Trump Organization and their employees, said congressional investigators have not yet contacted Graff.

“We have yet to receive such an inquiry but will, of course, continue to cooperate with any Committee seeking information,” Futerfas told ABC News.

It may seem like superfluous information, but Politifact, which prides itself on being “nonpartisan,” found it necessary to fully recount a back and forth Trump had with Clinton while fact checking a statement from former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.

Lewandowski said in an NBC interview Thursday that Trump was in Florida on June 9, 2016, the day of Don Jr.’s questionable meeting with a Russian lawyer. It’s not surprising to see people attempt to separate Trump from his son’s meeting, even when those defenses are wrong. PolitiFact concludes Lewandowski’s claim was incorrect, stating that, “Trump attended a fundraising lunch at the Four Seasons in New York before spending the rest of the day at Trump Tower.”

But the fact-check dedicates 114 words out of a 457-word article to the Clinton Twitter squabble. At just 106 words, less space goes to the evidence that supports the fact-check’s ruling than to covering Trump’s irrelevant tweets.

The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Fact Check team reached out to Politifact about the addition and received no response in time for publishing.

Almost a fourth of the check on his location focuses on Trump’s tweets during that day. It discusses the Twitter spat Trump and Clinton engaged in that began with Trump tweeting, “Crooked Hillary Clinton will be a disaster on jobs, the economy, trade, healthcare, the military, guns and just about all else. Obama plus!” Clinton later replied, “Delete your account.”

The tweets aren’t objectively useful in verifying or refuting Lewandowski’s statement on Trump whereabouts that day. So why would PolitiFact dedicate a sizable portion of the fact-check to discuss unrelated tweets?

TheDCNF has noted a few of PolitiFact’s inconsistent and blatantly false fact-checks in the past, but this strange interjection of Trump and Clinton’s tweets is something new.

When self-dubbed fact checkers begin to veer away from the relevant facts of a case, they become indistinguishable from opinion columnists. The information appears to be more about scoring points than about concluding on incontrovertible truth. It is unclear what Trump’s tweets had to do with the fact-check or what benefit they serve the reader.

82,##########,http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/17/why-donald-trump-jr-was-skeptical-of-goldstones-claims-in-email/,Why Donald Trump Jr. Was Skeptical Of Goldstone&#8217;s Claims In Email,[],Daily Caller,"In the wake of Donald Trump Jr. releasing emails that showed him arranging a meeting with a Russian lawyer, new reports suggest that Rob Goldstone was overselling and exaggerating the kind and nature of information to which he claimed he could gain access.

That Goldstone would do such a thing is hardly unexpected. As a former tabloid journalist and current music publicist, effective hyperbole is all but a required job skill. A great many journalists have overlooked this fact. While they briefly mention Goldstone and what he does, no one has really contextualized the impact that Goldstone’s profession might have had on Trump Jr.’s perceptions of the claims in his emails. Consider Goldstone’s opening email (see my article from Wednesday for a description of the key players referenced in the email):

Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting. The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump – helped along by Aras and Emin.

Beside the fact that almost nothing in this email was true (more on that later), Goldstone’s work history likely evoked a great deal of skepticism from Trump Jr. Instead of replying with a simple “hand it over, pal,” Trump Jr. prefaced his response with “if it’s what you say” before saying that he would “love” the information. The phrase “if it’s what you say” is not what one would expect another to say if he or she truly believed them. Trump Jr. has known Goldstone for years, so he probably knows whether Goldstone is prone to puffery. According to a recent op-ed in The New York Times, British tabloid newspaper scholar Peter Juke hints that Goldstone is so prone:

According to Mr. Goldstone’s account, he moved from local journalism to work for Rupert Murdoch’s best-selling British daily newspaper The Sun and other tabloids before turning to public relations for pop stars. . . . [S]mear campaigns based on opposition research are a core business strategy of Britain’s popular press. Our second-best-selling paper, The Daily Mail, specializes in hit jobs on public figures. . . . The Sun is even more expert at brutal sensationalism. . . . The Drudge Report and Breitbart News look like amateurs and naïfs in comparison. . .

Today Britain’s most important cultural export to the United States is the use of tabloid tricks and reality TV techniques for influence and profit. Rob Goldstone may look like a bit player in this story, but he is an avatar of the new power brokers in the age of politics as entertainment.

Reading Goldstone’s email through this lens allows one to rectify the gross inaccuracies contained within it. Goldstone recounted to The New York Times what Emin originally told him: “He said, ‘I’m told she [the Russian lawyer] has information about illegal campaign contributions to the D.N.C.[.]’” From this, somehow, Goldstone derived (a) that the information would implicate Hillary Clinton directly and (b) that the information was “obviously very high level and sensitive.” But it turns out that neither of those assertions was true.

In fact, almost nothing in Goldstone’s email was factually correct.

The meeting between the so-called “Crown prosecutor” and Aras Agalarov “never happened,” according to Scott Balber, Agalarov’s attorney. “Mr. Agalarov never had any communications with Russian government officials about Hillary Clinton or about the U.S. election campaign, period.”

Moreover, the so-called “incriminating” information to which Goldstone was referring, according to Bloomberg, “was hardly a bombshell” and amounted to “a politically motivated rehash of old allegations”:

Around the time of last summer’s meeting with Trump Jr., Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya was peddling a new political spin on a well-worn international scandal, according to one person familiar with her work. She was focusing on hedge fund manager William Browder, the subject of her scorn and of a film she was promoting, and on Ziff Brothers Investments LLC, which had invested with Browder, the person said. Russian prosecutors said they were opening new lines of inquiry against these investors. What Veselnitskaya saw in these steps were alleged tax improprieties that would be a black mark on the Democratic Party, because Browder and at least one member of the wealthy Ziff family had contributed to the Clinton Global Initiative, the person said.

As for the information constituting part of a government-wide effort on behalf of the Russian government, no one present at the meeting was a member of the Russian government—not Veselnitskaya, not the translator, and not the Russian-American lobbyist that was randomly asked to attend the meeting by Veselnitskaya while they were at lunch.

Given what we know about Goldstone, Trump Jr. likely took the meeting not really believing him. Indeed, “brutal sensationalism” always has a way of coming up short, in the end. So when Trump Jr. said he would “love” it “if” Goldstone were correct, he probably knew and expected that Goldstone would not actually deliver—which he didn’t.

Though Goldstone has been the subject of quite a few articles, the impact his character might have had on Trump Jr.’s perceptions of his email has not. We all have that friend who exaggerates. That we condition ourselves to that exaggeration does not also imply, however, that we believe the hype.

The reality is that Trump Jr. probably did not expect to get a lot out of the meeting. And as it turns out, he got a whole lot less than that."

“I’m ready to clarify the situation behind this mass hysteria,” she reportedly stated in an interview with Russia’s RT TV channel late Tuesday. “But only through lawyers or testifying in the Senate.”

Veselnitskaya has claimed before that she is a private lawyer, with no ties to the Kremlin and with no damaging information on Clinton.

In a statement to the New York Times, she claimed that “nothing at all about the Presidential election” was discussed with Trump Jr. Veselnitskaya stated she had not “discussed any of these matters with any representative of the Russian government” and had “never acted on behalf of the Russian government.”

Trump Jr. expressed that the lawyer “had no meaningful information.”

“Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense,” he proclaimed in his statement released on Twitter. “It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting.”"

The New York Times reported Monday that a publicist and British tabloid reporter named Robert Goldstone brokered a meeting between Trump Jr. and a Kremlin-aligned lawyer on June 9, 2016, to discuss damaging information about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton compiled by the Russian government. The email could be the first tangible evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and foreign interests.

“In my view, this is much ado about nothing,” Futerfas said of the email to The New York Times. “During this busy period, Robert Goldstone contacted Don Jr. in an email and suggested that people had information concerning alleged wrongdoing by Democratic Party front-runner, Hillary Clinton, in her dealings with Russia. Don Jr.’s takeaway from this communication was that someone had information potentially helpful to the campaign and it was coming from someone he knew.”

“Don Jr. had no knowledge as to what specific information, if any, would be discussed,” he added.

Trump Jr. himself called the story “nonsense.”

As the Times notes, there is no evidence to suggest Trump Jr.’s meeting was connected to the Russian government’s broad cyber campaign against American political organizations and institutions, including the DNC.

Trump the younger has previously denied any knowledge of Russian efforts to interfere in last year’s presidential election.

“It’s disgusting, it’s so phony,” he said of the allegations to CNN’s Jake Tapper on July 24, 2016, some six weeks after the June 9 meeting.

“I can’t think of bigger lies,” he added.

The Morning Consult/Politico survey showed 52 percent of conservatives believe the June 2016 meeting between Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was “appropriate.”

Only 28 percent of Republicans believed the meeting was “inappropriate” and 20 percent said they weren’t sure. The Democrats had a much different view on the meeting according to the survey, with 81 percent saying Trump Jr.’s meeting was inappropriate.

The survey also asked participants about impeaching President Donald Trump. Forty-six percent of registered voters believe Congress should not impeach Trump, and 40 percent believe he should be impeached.

Democratic strategist Josh Nanberg said the survey’s numbers were an indication “that the president’s ‘nothing to see here’ messaging is taking hold,” Morning Consult reported.

Voters did not think that collusion is an impeachable offense, according to the survey. Only 12 percent of the participants said Trump should be impeached even if Robert Mueller is appointed as special counsel and reaches a conclusion that Trump did coordinate with Russia.

Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for Donald Trump Jr., told CNN that the mystery man is a U.S. citizen who represents the Agalarov family, the Russian-Azerbaijani billionaires who requested the meeting.

Futerfas said he has talked to the eighth attendee within the past couple of weeks. The man says he is not affiliated with the Russian government.

Futerfas and Scott Balber, a lawyer for the Agalarovs who in the past has represented Donald Trump and the Miss Universe Organization, have declined to provide the name of the man.

It is unclear why that information is kept secret.

CNN first reported the existence of an eighth attendee on Friday. On the Trump side of the meeting was Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Rob Goldstone, a publicist for Emin Agalarov, a musician and scion of the billionaire family, also attended. Goldstone is the person who contacted Trump Jr. offering up the meeting in an email sent last June 3. (RELATED: ID Of 8th Trump Tower Meeting Attendee Remains A Mystery)

Goldstone said in that email that the Agalarovs wanted to pass opposition research to the Trump campaign about Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian “government’s support for Mr. Trump.”

He said that a “Russian government lawyer” would provide the information. Trump Jr. agreed to receive the material, saying, “if it is what you say I love it.”

On the Russian side of the meeting was the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, her translator and a former State Department contractor named Anatoli Samochornov, and Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist who some U.S. officials believe is tied to Russian intelligence. (RELATED: Here’s What We Know Of Suspected Ex-Soviet Intel Officer Who Attended Trump Tower Meeting)

The three Russians worked last year for the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, a non-profit group that aimed to undercut the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions bill opposed by the Russian government. (RELATED: Russian Lawyer’s Translator Was A State Department Contractor)

Fusion GPS, the firm behind the dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, was also hired to work on that campaign.

That trio did not respond to repeated requests for comment from The Daily Caller over the weekend. Representatives for Kushner, Manafort, and Goldstone have also not responded to repeated inquiries.

According to Futerfas, the eighth man’s recollection about the meeting matched up with what some other attendees have said — that pleasantries were exchanged and that Veselnitskaya briefly discussed the anti-Clinton materials before turning her attention to the Magnitsky Act.

Futerfas said that the man does not recall what Akhmetshin told one news outlet — that Veselnitskaya left behind documents regarding the Clinton opposition research.

As of Sunday, President Trump’s legal team claimed they did not know the name of all of the people who attended the meeting.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley sent a letter to Trump Jr. on Thursday, NPR and other news outlets reported. The real estate executive, who is President Trump’s oldest son, said earlier this week that he is willing to testify under oath about his meeting with the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya.

CNN reported earlier on Thursday that Grassley planned to issue the hearing invitation and would issue a subpoena if necessary.

Trump Jr.’s meeting with Veselnitskaya, which occurred on June 9, 2016, has led to accusations from Trump critics that the campaign attempted to collude with the Russian government.

Trump Jr. released emails which showed that he was asked to meet with a “Russian government attorney” who wanted to provide damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

Trump Jr. told the intermediary, a music publicist named Rob Goldstone, of the offer: “I love it.”

Goldstone contacted Trump Jr. on June 3 saying that a Russian oligarch had offered to provide the anti-Clinton dirt.

“This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,” Goldstone wrote, adding that his clients, the Agalarov family, were behind the effort.

The Trumps and Agalarovs were partners for the 2013 Miss Universe pageant held in Moscow.

Trump Jr. and Goldstone eventually set June 9 as the date for the meeting. Trump Jr.’s brother-in-law, Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul Manafort also attended the 20 minute session.

Both Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya have claimed that the Russian attorney did not provide any information about Clinton. Instead, she lobbied against the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law that impacted one of her clients, a Russian businessman named Denis Katsyv.

Trump Jr. has said that while he would have probably handled the meeting request differently now, he believes he did nothing wrong by hearing out someone offering information about a political opponent during a heated political campaign.

On Wednesday, the committee invited Trump Jr. and Manafort to testify at a hearing to explore shortcomings in the Foreign Agents Registration Act. But the hearing is likely to cover the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting that Trump Jr. set up with a Russian lawyer.

Manafort and Trump adviser Jared Kushner attended the meeting, which Trump Jr. accepted after being offered derogatory information about Hillary Clinton.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the chairman and ranking member of the committee, respectively, said that subpoenas will be issued if Trump Jr. and Manafort refuse the invitation to testify.

“We sent the letter, I don’t know whether they’ve accepted, but we sent the letter and we asked them for a voluntary appearance, and we also, I think we’ve indicated to them that — I don’t know if we said it in the letter or not — but we indicated to them, at least publicly I indicated to them that there will be a subpoena if they don’t come,” Grassley told CNN.

“We are having a hearing next Wednesday, so obviously we want to hear right away so we can get the subpoena — I hope they accept the subpoena voluntarily, but if they don’t then you have to have a marshal give it and that takes a little more time.”

In letters to Trump Jr. and Manafort, Grassley requested detailed records of any interactions with a list of Russians.

Neither Trump Jr. nor Manafort has said publicly that he will attend the hearing. A spokesman for Manafort said Wednesday that the invitation is being reviewed.

While Trump Jr.’s lawyer did not respond to requests for comment, Trump Jr. told Sean Hannity earlier this month that he is willing to discuss the Trump Tower meeting under oath.

Also invited to next week’s hearing is Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of Fusion GPS, and Bill Browder, a London-based hedge fund manager.

Fusion GPS is the opposition research firm that financed a dossier of anti-Trump research compiled last year by former British spy Christopher Steele.

It was reported last week that Simpson would likely not show up to the hearing. Grassley has threatened to issue a subpoena against Simpson to compel his appearance.

Browder, who was investigated last year by Simpson, has agreed to appear at the hearing.

Veselnitskaya successfully represented FSB in property disputes in Moscow from 2005 to 2013, Reuters reports.

While there is no indication that Veselnitskaya is an employee of the Russian government, her past work for FSB, the successor to the Soviet KGB, is sure to stoke the interest of federal and congressional investigators looking into the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting.

Veselnitskaya was described as a “Russian government attorney” in a June 3, 2016, email sent to Trump Jr. offering up the Trump Tower meeting.

Rob Goldstone, a music publicist who knew Trump Jr., said that the lawyer wanted to provide derogatory information about Hillary Clinton. In the email, he said that the information originated with Russia’s “Crown Prosecutor,” an apparent reference to Yury Chaika, the chief prosecutor.

Since the existence of the meeting was revealed earlier this month, Veselnitskaya has acknowledged having contact with Chaika, who has a reputation of compiling blackmail materials, or kompromot, on political targets.

Veselnitskaya says that her goal in the meeting was to lobby the Trump campaign against the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law that blacklists Russian businessmen accused of human rights abuses.

Veselnitskaya is an attorney for Denis Katsyv, a Russian businessman who potentially faced sanctions under the Magnitsky Act.

Last year, the lawyer helped form a Delaware-based non-profit called the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation to lobby against Magnitsky. The group hired Rinat Akhmetshin to lobby some U.S. lawmakers against the law. Some U.S. officials believe that Akhmetshin, who also attended the Trump Tower meeting, is connected to Russia’s intelligence agencies.

Akhmetshin, who denies being a Kremlin spy, has extensive contacts with Washington, D.C. reporters and frequently provides them with opposition research on behalf of his clients.

The Russian-American lobbyist accompanied Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya to the meeting, which was also attended by presidential son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner and then Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. Trump Jr. originally maintained that the meeting focused on restoring American adoption of Russian children and the rollback of U.S. sanctions on Russia.

Emails subsequently released from Trump Jr. himself reveal a former acquaintance of his brokered the meeting with Veselnitskaya under the auspices of giving damaging information on Clinton to the campaign. The emails explicitly mention Veselnitskaya’s supposed connection to the Russian government and cast it as an attempt by the Russians to help the Trump campaign.

“He is a U.S. citizen. He told me specifically he was not working for the Russian government, and in fact laughed when I asked him that question,” Trump Jr.’s lawyer Alan Futerfas told NBCNews. Futerfas added that Trump Jr. was unaware of the former military officer’s identity.

The former military officer is presumably Rinat Akhmetshin, Yahoo Finance editor Michael B Kelly noted on twitter in the aftermath of the story.

The news comes a day after Trump appeared to caution Mueller against expanding his investigation in that direction.

“I think that’s a violation. Look, this is about Russia,” Trump said in an interview with The New York Times when asked whether Mueller will have crossed a red line by broadening the investigation to include Trump’s companies. (RELATED: Trump Delivers A Warning To Mueller)

Mueller was appointed special counsel in May to look into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, an allegation that Trump strongly denied.

According to Bloomberg, investigators are now looking into various real estate transactions involving Trump’s companies and wealthy Russians. Trump’s sale of a Florida mansion to a Russian oligarch in 2008 is of interest to investigators, according to Bloomberg. So is a SoHo real estate development deal between Trump Organization and Bayrock Capital, a real estate firm managed by Felix Sater, a Russian-American developer convicted of securities fraud in the 1990s.

Mueller is also reportedly looking at Trump’s dealings with Russian oligarch Aras Agalarov. Agalarov paid Trump $20 million to host the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.

Agalarov and his son are currently under scrutiny because of their involvement in the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower hosted by Donald Trump Jr.

Emin Agalarov, the pop musician son of the Russian tycoon, instructed his publicist, Rob Goldstone, to contact Donald Trump Jr. to set up the meeting. Goldstone told Trump Jr. that a “Russian government attorney” would be providing the Trump campaign with information about Hillary Clinton.

Trump’s comments on Wednesday stoked speculation that he is considering firing Mueller, a former director of the FBI. Trump also expressed frustration with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose recusal from the Russia probe paved the way for Mueller’s hiring in May.

Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Senate Republican, suggested Donald Trump Jr. should answer questions before the Senate Intelligence Committee Monday.

“Our intelligence committee needs to interview him and others who attended the meeting,” Collins, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters Monday.

“I suspect that the independent counsel will as well,” Susan Collins said. “To me it shows the need for both investigations to continue.” https://t.co/ivEu5L4v8J — Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) July 10, 2017

This call to action comes just days after a New York Times report claimed Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer last year in an attempt to impact the presidential election.

The meeting, which took place last summer, allegedly included Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya. The goal of the meeting, according to the report, was to receive compromising information on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

The Maine senator thinks more information about the meeting is necessary, despite claims from top White House officials that it is a goose chase.

Collins’ fellow Senate Intelligence Committee member Republican Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford added that the committee is “walking through the details” of a meeting with President Donald Trump’s eldest son.

On “Fox News Sunday,” White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said, “It was a short meeting, a meeting apparently about Russian adoption, and after about 20 minutes, the meeting ended and that was the end of it.”

“No information was received that was meaningful or helpful,” counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway told ABC’s “Good Morning America” Monday. “We have many different meetings in a campaign, some of them are unhelpful and not particularly meaningful.”

Trump Jr. said via Twitter that he would be willing to work with the Senate Intelligence Committee. “Happy to work with the committee to pass on what I know,” he tweeted out Monday.

Shortly after that tweet went out, Reuters reported that Trump Jr. hired lawyer Alan Futerfas, a New York City-based attorney, to represent him in any further inquiries regarding the Russia investigation.

When asked if the allegations turn out to be true, if he would still be fine with Trump Jr.’s meeting, Zeldin responded saying, “Any American campaign at any level from President of The United States to the local level, we do not meet with foreign, hostile governments to get information to damage political opponents.”

Donald Trump Jr. released several emails Tuesday, that changed Zeldin’s view on the Russia “nothing burger.”

The headlines on my imaginary Clinton cover are the same: “Red Handed. The Russia Scandal Hits Home.” My highlighted prompts, however, are quite different:

$500,000 speech

Uranium One

$148 million

Foreign Clinton Foundation funding

Rosatom chairman to Putin: “Few could have imagined in the past that we would own 20 percent of U.S. reserves.

Such prompts, of course, stand for a dense chain of complex evidence that quickly branches into a maze of treasonous activities:

Russian reset

Skolkovo

FBI and Army warnings

Hypersonic missile technology transfer

Opposition to the Magnitsky Act

John Podesta and Russian oligarchs being on the board of Joule Unlimited

100 million rubles from Putin

75,000 shares to Podesta

And, whaddya know, the Podesta Group lobbies for Uranium One. And Renaissance Capital, which paid Bill Clinton that half a mill for a speech, also touts Uranium One stock …

My prompts would require thousands and thousands of words to fill in the ellipses — fact-gathering, once known as reporting, that Time magazine and almost none of its comrades do since it gets in the way of their desperate political hackery.

The Time magazine Trump Jr. cover prompts, however, which appear on the newsstands of what passes for real life, are very different because there is to date little more to the entire “red-handed scandal hitting home” story. Sure, there are details to be noted (and a whole nest of anti-Trump Russian operatives to explore that Time won’t want to), but these elliptical cover lines go no further than the Trump family smear they recklessly and maliciously create.

Call it evil; call it a triumph of deconstructionism. It is another clear sign that this war the media fight is really against the pursuit of the truth."

Trump Jr. initially claimed in his July 8 statement that the June 9, 2016 meeting was about the adoption of Russian children by U.S. citizens. But it came to light over the next several days that the 39-year-old real estate executive accepted the meeting after being promised negative information about Hillary Clinton.

And rather than discussing adoptions, the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, used the meeting to lobby against the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions bill opposed by the Russian government.

Trump Jr. was contacted with the offer by email on June 3, 2016 by Rob Goldstone, an acquaintance and the music publicist for a Russian-Azerbaijani musician whose family is close to Vladimir Putin.

Goldstone told Trump Jr. that a “Russian government attorney” — Veselnitskaya — would be presenting the Clinton dirt during the Trump Tower meeting. Trump Jr. invited his brother-in-law, Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

Veselnitskaya attended with Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist and former Soviet military officer, and a translator.

In his initial Trump-crafted statement, Trump Jr. said that he and Veselnitskaya “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.”

“I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand,” he added.

After that statement was released to The New York Times, the newspaper followed up with a story revealing that Trump Jr. agreed to the meeting after being offered information about Clinton.

Trump Jr. would go on to release his email exchanges with Goldstone after The New York Times informed him that they were planning to publish the documents, which they obtained through undisclosed means.

The White House and Trump Jr. have made several different arguments in an attempt to downplay the significance of the meeting. They’ve said both that nothing significant came of the meeting and that any other political campaign would have entertained an offer of opposition research on an opponent.

According to The Post, Trump crafted his son’s statement aboard Air Force One on the flight back from the G-20 summit in Germany.

Trump dictated the statement to Hope Hicks, his longtime assistant and head of White House strategic communications.

Follow Her On Twitter At']",FOX News,"The Russian lawyer who landed a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. during last year’s presidential campaign with the promise of dirt on Hillary Clinton had one big thing in common with the Democratic candidate: Both had opposed Russia sanctions targeting human-rights abusers.

Further, former Secretary of State Clinton’s initial opposition coincided with a $500,000 speech her husband gave in Moscow – a link her 2016 campaign fought to downplay in the press, according to WikiLeaks-released documents.

Trump White House officials now are trying to draw attention to that speech and the Clintons’ ties to Russia in a bid to counter criticism over Trump Jr.’s now-infamous meeting.

“If you want to talk about having relationships with Russia, I'd look no further than the Clintons,” Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a briefing last week. “Bill Clinton was paid half a million dollars to give a speech to a Russian bank, personally thanked by President Putin.”

“With the help of the research team, we killed a Bloomberg story trying to link HRC’s opposition to the Magnitsky bill a $500,000 speech that WJC gave in Moscow.” — May, 2015 email from Clinton campaign staffer

The former president indeed had received a personal call from then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin expressing his appreciation for the speech. According to Mrs. Clinton’s ethics disclosure form filed while she was secretary of State, Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 by the Russia-based finance company Renaissance Capital for his June 29, 2010, speech in Moscow to its employees and guests attending the company's annual conference.

The speech is now coming back to haunt the Clintons, considering the company that cut the check was allegedly tied to the scandal that spurred the Global Magnitsky Act, a bill that imposed sanctions on Russians designated as human-rights abusers and eventually would become law in 2012.

This was the same law Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya was lobbying against during her sit-down with Trump Jr. last year. And back in 2010, it would have put the Clintons on her side.

Shortly before Bill Clinton’s speech in 2010, when members of Congress pushing the sanctions bill had asked Hillary Clinton to refuse visas to Russian officials implicated under the policy, the State Department denied the request. The Obama administration initially was opposed to the Magnitsky Act because then-President Barack Obama was seeking a “reset” with Russia and did not want to deepen the divide between the two countries.

Former President Bill Clinton’s speech to Renaissance just weeks later was all the more curious, considering Renaissance’s Russian investment bank executives would have been banned from the U.S. under the law.

Fast-forward to 2015, and the timeline apparently had caught the attention of Bloomberg News.

According to a memo from Clinton’s presidential campaign team later published by WikiLeaks, however, the Clinton campaign was able to stop the presses.

“With the help of the research team, we killed a Bloomberg story trying to link HRC’s opposition to the Magnitsky bill a $500,000 speech that WJC gave in Moscow,” Jesse Lehrich, on the Rapid Response Communications team for Hillary For America, boasted on May 21, 2015.

The Global Magnitsky Act was named for 36-year-old tax attorney Sergei Magnitsky, who died in the custody of the Russian government after accusing the government and organized crime of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from a foreign company, Hermitage Capital Management. Magnitsky, hired by foreign investor and Hermitage owner William Browder, had tracked what turned out to be hundreds of millions of dollars in tax fraud. He reported the fraud to the Russian authorities, but instead of pursuing charges against the alleged offender, Russian authorities jailed Magnitsky.

After Magnitsky died in November 2009, Browder said Magnitsky proved Renaissance officials were among those orchestrating the scheme.

The State Department finally reversed its position in 2011 and refused visas to some Russians purportedly involved in the financial fraud seeking to enter the country.

The Magnitsky Act passed with bipartisan support in 2012.

Russia retaliated against the U.S., ending any possibility for Americans to adopt Russian orphans and also banning 18 U.S. officials from entering their country."

Committee chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and ranking member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., confirmed in a statement that they subpoenaed Simpson to appear before the committee Wednesday as part of a hearing about the influence of foreign lobbying in last year's presidential election.

""Simpson’s attorney has asserted that his client will invoke his Fifth Amendment rights in response to the subpoena,"" Grassley and Feinstein said.

During the campaign, Fusion GPS contracted former MI-6 agent Christopher Steele to look into rumors about Trump's financial and social connections in Russia. The resulting ""dossier,"" which was leaked to the media following Trump's victory in November included a number of sordid allegations about the president's sexual proclivities.

Last week, Fox News reported that Fusion GPS had ties to Russian efforts to undermine U.S. sanctions that were led by attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.

Investment manager Bill Browder claims Simpson was hired by one of Veselnitskaya's clients, Prevezon Holdings, as part of an effort to repeal the Magnitsky Act, named for Sergei Magnitsky — an attorney for Browder who was beaten to death in a Moscow prison after accusing Russian authorities of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars through tax refunds and then laundering the money through New York banks.

Veselnitskaya became the center of a political storm earlier this month after Donald Trump Jr. made public emails indicating that he had taken a meeting with her on the promise of receiving damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

Grassley and Feinstein also noted that both Trump Jr., who met with Veselnitskaya in June of last year, and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who sat in on the meeting, are negotiating their appearances and the possibility of turning over documents, but left open the possibility that the pair would be subpoenaed.

Fusion GPS has said it had nothing to do with the Trump Jr.-Veselnitskaya meeting.

“Fusion GPS learned about this meeting from news reports and had no prior knowledge of it. Any claim that Fusion GPS arranged or facilitated this meeting in any way is absolutely false,” the company said in a statement.

Manafort had attracted scrutiny for months from congressional committees and Mueller. The Associated Press reported in June that Mueller's probe has incorporated a long-standing federal investigation into Manafort's financial dealings. That investigation is scrutinizing political consulting work he did for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine and the country's former president, Viktor Yanukovych.



Manafort has denied any wrongdoing related to his Ukrainian work, saying through a spokesman that it ""was totally open and appropriate.""



Manafort also recently registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for parts of Ukrainian work that occurred in Washington. The filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act came retroactively, a tacit acknowledgement that he operated in Washington in violation of the federal transparency law.

The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Follow Her On Twitter At']",FOX News,"Senate Democrats used a parliamentary maneuver Wednesday to cut short a high-profile hearing, where a key witness was set to testify on Russia's misdeeds and also raise fresh allegations against the company behind the infamous anti-Trump dossier.

Bill Browder, the CEO and co-founder of Hermitage Capital, was set to tell the Senate Judiciary Committee that the co-founder of the firm Fusion GPS was hired to conduct a ""smear campaign"" against him. Further, he planned to testify the campaign was orchestrated by Natalia Veselnitskaya -- the Russian attorney who sought the highly scrutinized Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort in June 2016.

Browder released written testimony ahead of the hearing but his public remarks were delayed when Democrats invoked the ""two-hour rule"" to protest Republican efforts to repeal ObamaCare. The seldom-used rule bars committees from meeting more than two hours after the full Senate begins a session.

“Veselnitskaya, through Baker Hostetler, hired Glenn Simpson of the firm Fusion GPS to conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of congressional hearings on the Global Magnitsy Act.” — Bill Browder, in prepared statement to Senate committee

“I don’t know if the minority is intentionally trying to block testimony that may be critical of a firm behind the unverified Trump dossier, but I’ll bet two bits that had Paul Manafort or Donald Trump, Jr. appeared at today’s hearing, it would not have been prematurely shut down,"" Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a statement. ""The Democrat leadership is playing politics, plain and simple.""

Browder now is expected to testify Thursday, but his statement makes clear that he will have plenty to say about Fusion GPS, the shadowy intel company founded by a pair of former Wall Street Journal reporters, including Glenn Simpson.

“Veselnitskaya, through Baker Hostetler, hired Glenn Simpson of the firm Fusion GPS to conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of congressional hearings on the Global Magnitsky Act,” Browder wrote in his prepared testimony, adding that the firm helped to organize a Washington D.C.-based premiere of a “fake documentary” about Magnitsky and himself.

“While they were conducting these operations in Washington D.C., at no time did they indicate that they were acting on behalf of Russian government interests, nor did they file disclosures under the Foreign Agent Registration Act,” Browder’s prepared testimony said.

Browder added: “This was one of the best examples of Putin’s propaganda.”

Browder hired the late Sergei Magnitsky to uncover details of massive financial fraud in Russia involving corrupt Russian government officials. Magnitsky was imprisoned and ultimately beaten to death by Russian officers in Moscow. In the wake of his death, the U.S. passed a law named for him that brought sanctions against Russian oligarchs suspected of money laundering.

Grassley noted that he had been asking about the Russians working with Fusion GPS since March 2017. He cited the widely discredited dossier compiled about Trump that circulated among Democratic operatives and the media during the latter stages of the 2016 presidential campaign.

“Mr. Simpson’s company, Fusion GPS, is the same firm that oversaw the creation of the unverified Trump Dossier,” Grassley said in his opening statement. “It is vital for the Committee to fully understand Fusion’s failure to register under FARA and its role in the creating and spreading of the dossier.”

Grassley acknowledged that around the same time Fusion helped to “orchestrate a propaganda campaign” to repeal the Magnitsky Act, Fusion “appears to have been involved in the creation of the dirty Trump Dossier.”

“There are public reports that the FBI used the dossier to kickstart its Russia investigation—Did the FBI know that Fusion pitched Russian propaganda for another client as it pushed the Trump dossier?” Grassley asked in his opening statement, delivered before the hearing was cut short.

Grassley questioned Veselnitskaya’s meeting at Trump Tower.

“Was it just a clumsy bait-and-switch effort in their unregistered propaganda and influence campaign? They offered dirt on the opponent to get the meeting and then made their pitch against the Magnitsky Act?” Grassley asked. “Or was it an offer of collusion? Or maybe both?”

Grassley and Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called for the president’s eldest son to testify, along with Manafort, and Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS in the committee’s oversight hearing on FARA. All three witnesses have since reached arrangements to interview with the committee, for now, in private.

“There was no mystery of who Natalia Veselnitskaya was. A simple Google search would have shown that she was the main in house lawyer for a high level Russian government official whose son was accused by the US DOJ of money laundering from the Magnitsky case in the US,” Browder told Fox News before his appearance before the committee. “Either the people in that meeting didn't do any due diligence in advance or someone made an error in judgement agreeing to meet with her in the first place.”

But with regard to Fusion GPS, Browder told Fox News that he didn’t know what else Simpson was involved with, but that the group did not register under FARA.

“Natalia engaged Glenn Simpson and Fusion GPS in order to run an anti-Magnitsky Act smear campaign in Washington D.C. which was funded by sources connected to the Russian government,” Browder told Fox News.

Though he did not testify before the committee Wednesday, Thor Halvorssen, a human rights advocate with the Human Rights Foundation, submitted statements for the record to the committee in regards to his experience with Fusion GPS.

“It’s the sort of thing they specialize in—mainstreaming false smears, allegations that are so salacious and over the top that people assume they must be true,” Halvorssen told Fox News, noting the crude dossier about the president. “They did this with Browder, they did this with two other whistleblowers and they did this with me –they are outrageous accusations where innocence just isn’t enough.”

Halvorssen said public exposure is key to combatting Fusion GPS, which he said has been active in international smear campaigns.

in his written statement, Halvorssen told the committee that Fusion GPS targeted him and several others because of their criticism of Derwick Associates, a Venezuelan energy company that was reportedly being investigated for an alleged multi-billion dollar bribe.

“I think it’s clear that this is not the case of a company that forgot to register, or didn’t know that they had to register,” Halvorssen told Fox News. “Fusion GPS purposely, and quite deliberately, chose not to register so that their activity would fly under the radar, leading people to see the result of their work as organic and real, pushing a noble vision of truth, instead of what it actually is –smear campaigns in return for large enough retainers.”'

But in its statement given to Fox News earlier this month, Fusion said it had nothing to do with the Trump Jr. meeting.

“Fusion GPS learned about this meeting from news reports and had no prior knowledge of it. Any claim that Fusion GPS arranged or facilitated this meeting in any way is absolutely false,” the statement read."

Fleischer: Trump Jr. Meeting Was 'Bad Judgment,' Not Evidence of Collusion With Russia

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) said this afternoon that he now sees Robert Mueller's Russia investigation as a probe into possible ""treason.""

Kaine and others on Capitol Hill reacted this afternoon to the latest revelations about a meeting last June between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.

Earlier today, Trump Jr. released what he said was the “entire email chain” of conversations setting up the meeting with attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.

In the email chain, Trump Jr. expresses interest in obtaining damaging information on Hillary Clinton.

Kaine, who was Clinton's running mate last year, said the new reports take the probe to another level.

""To meet with an adversary to try to get information to hijack democracy, the investigation is now more than just an obstruction of justice investigation, more than just a perjury investigation, it's a treason investigation,"" he said.

But Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) questioned why the Russian government would send a lawyer who didn't know anything to the Trump campaign.

""It's kind of an odd way to suggest the Russian government wants to help,"" he said.

The president's eldest son seemed to readily accept the offer, according to the messages.

""My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency,"" President Trump said in a statement issued later on Tuesday.

The email chain -- purported to be between Trump Jr. and publicist Rob Goldstone -- occurred in June 2016. Goldstone went on to set up the controversial June 9 meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, whom he identified in the emails at one point as ""The Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow.""

READ THE EMAILS

""The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,"" an email identified as being from Goldstone said. It was the first email in the chain released by Trump Jr., who helped during his father's presidential campaign but is not part of his White House staff.

""This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump -- helped along by Aras and Emin.""

Trump Jr. said in a statement on Tuesday he knew ""Emin"" from helping to organize the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Russia. That person appears to be Emin Agalarov, whose father, Aras Agalarov, is a billionaire with reported ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Trump Jr. replied in the email chain: ""Seems we have some time and if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer.""

Veselnitskaya has since denied in an interview with NBC having ""any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton.""

""It was never my intention to have that,"" she said.

Donald Trump Jr. also has denied any wrongdoing occurred in the meeting, which also included then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior aide.

""The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was Political Opposition Research,"" Trump Jr. said in the Tuesday statement. ""I first wanted to just have a phone call but when they didn’t work out, they said the woman would be in New York and asked if I would meet. I decided to take the meeting...As Rob Goldstone said just today in the press, the entire meeting was 'the most insane nonsense I ever heard. And I was actually agitated by it.'""

The New York Times on Twitter said Trump Jr. only tweeted images of the emails after ""he was told NYT was about to publish the contents of the emails.""

The email disclosure is likely to embolden critics of President Trump and those attempting to link his campaign to alleged collusion with Russian officials. Even before the Trump Jr. emails became public, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., blasted the Trump administration.

“There’s no escaping it: the Trump Campaign’s inner circle met with an agent of a hostile foreign power to influence the outcome of an American election,"" Pelosi said in a Tuesday statement. ""The American people face a White House riddled with shadowy Russian connections and desperate to hide the truth.""

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., also hit Trump Jr. for the email chain.

""The email chain confirms that the President’s son was both aware of and supported the Russian government’s efforts to help the President get elected,"" Cummings said in a statement.

President Trump, via his outside legal representation, has denied knowing about or attending the meeting.

A spokesman for Vice President Pence also issued a statement distancing Pence from the mushrooming affair.

""The Vice President was not aware of the meeting,"" Vice Presidential Press Secretary Marc Lotter said. ""He is not focused on stories about the campaign, particularly stories about the time before he joined the ticket.""

In the initial June 3 email, Goldstone wrote that he could ""also send this info to your father via [his assistant] but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.""

Most of the rest of the email chain is scheduling minutiae, with Trump trying to arrange a phone call and then working out a suitable meeting time with Goldstone's contact.

There is nothing contained in the emails to suggest Trump Jr. was informed of the larger alleged Russian effort to meddle in the U.S. presidential election.

President Trump tweeted at Aras about Emin following the Miss Universe Pageant in 2013: ""@AgalarovAras I had a great weekend with you and your family. You have done a FANTASTIC job. TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next. EMIN was WOW!"""

Follow Her On Twitter At']",FOX News,"The Obama administration granted the Russian attorney who met with Donald Trump Jr. last June a special type of “parole” to be in the United States after she initially was denied a visa, Fox News has confirmed – though it remains unclear whether she had permission to be in the country when she attended the Trump Tower session.

That meeting has, in the last week, caused massive headaches for the Trump White House, with the revelation that an intermediary told the president's son the attorney had dirt on Hillary Clinton, supposedly as part of the Russian government's bid to help his dad.

But as lawmakers from both parties are scrutinizing the Trump family over the contacts, one powerful senator is pressing to find out how attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya was in the country at all.

Well before the June 9, 2016, meeting, she was denied a visa to enter the U.S. in 2015, according to court filings first reported by the Daily Beast. She was granted a “parole” to be in the country from October 2015 through early January 2016. However, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York told Fox News on Thursday that their office did not extend that status.

“She was not granted a second parole by our office,” office spokesman James Margolin told Fox News in an email. “Her case-related immigration parole ended early in 2016, and it was not renewed by us.”

Veselnitskaya’s Facebook posts and documented meetings show that she remained in the United States well after her initial parole expired in early January 2016. This includes photos of New York City’s Columbus Circle well into February, raising questions as to how she was allowed to be in the country at that time -- and for her meeting with Trump Jr. as well as a trip to Washington, D.C. days after. Campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner also attended that meeting.

“She shouldn’t have been in the country,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told “Fox & Friends” on Wednesday. “I think the lady Russian lawyer that was there in that meeting, I’ve written to [The State Department and Department of Homeland Security] to find out what she was doing in the country when presumably either her visa or parole expired.”

A spokesman for the Senate Judiciary Committee told Fox News that they had yet to receive a response.

The State Department did not confirm or deny that Veselnitskaya even applied for a visa, but told Fox News that the department is prohibited by the Immigration and Nationality Act from discussing individual visa cases. The State Department did, however, tell Fox News that all visa applications are adjudicated on a case-by-case basis.

The Hill reported on Wednesday that it was the Obama Department of Justice that granted Veselnitskaya her temporary parole allowing her into the country to help a client on a court case in the New York federal court. The U.S. attorney’s office told Fox News that Veselnitskaya was indeed granted initial parole by their office, but did not know who, specifically, issued the “piece of paper.”

The Hill reported the parole was approved by then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

In court documents, the attorney acknowledged she had ""applied for a visa to enter the United States, but was denied.""

She continued, “However, the United States did issue a parole letter for me to enter the United States in order to help defend this lawsuit. Nevertheless, I have been harassed by the Government despite being paroled into the United States.”

In the same documents, she confirmed that her request to extend her parole, which expired Jan. 7 2016, was denied a few days before that deadline.

Unclear is how she was in the U.S. several months later and whether other agencies were also involved in her parole decision from the outset.

GRASSLEY PROBING HOW RUSSIAN LAWYER GOT INTO US AFTER VISA DENIAL

A range of Department of Homeland Security agencies would typically deal with parole requests. However, Acting Chief of Media Relations for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Gillian Christensen told Fox News that USCIS was not involved in this case.

Broadly speaking, Christensen told Fox News that parole is granted “sparingly” and in “extraordinary circumstances,” including urgent humanitarian reasons, such as a medical or family emergency. The official also told Fox News that parole may be requested for a person who “believes his or her presence in the United States will be a significant public benefit,” and cited participation in a civil court case as an example.

Veselnitskaya was working as an attorney for a Cyprus-based real estate holdings company called Prevezon, run by Denis Katsyv, son of Pyotr Katsyv, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest advisers, and was given “unlimited resources” by the Kremlin-connected group to run a campaign to get the Magnitsky Act repealed, Fox News reported Wednesday. The Magnitsky Act enacts sanctions on certain Russian officials as a punishment for human rights violations.

“Parole allows an individual to enter the United States and remain for a temporary period corresponding to the reason parole was approved,” Christensen told Fox News. “Parole is generally not authorized for more than one year.”"

""I was not told her name prior to the meeting. I asked Jared (Kushner) and Paul (Manafort) to attend, but told them nothing of the substance. We had a meeting in June 2016. After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton.

""Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information. She then changed subjects and began discussing the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act.

""It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting. I interrupted and advised her that my father was not an elected official, but rather a private citizen, and that her comments and concerns were better addressed if and when he held public office.

""The meeting lasted approximately 20 to 30 minutes. As it ended, my acquaintance apologized for taking up our time. That was the end of it and there was no further contact or follow-up of any kind. My father knew nothing of the meeting or these events."""

Double Standard? Team Trump Calls Out DNC Coordination With Ukraine

President Donald Trump was asked at a news conference whether his son, Donald Trump Jr., should have accepted a meeting with a Russian lawyer in order to potentially obtain dirt on Hillary Clinton.

Trump took questions alongside French President Emmanuel Macron on a trip to Paris. The reporter noted that FBI Director nominee Chris Wray said yesterday authorities should have been notified of the Russian contact by Trump Jr.

""Most people would have taken that meeting,"" Trump answered.

He said it was a ""very fast"" meeting and it was part of ""opposition research [which is] very standard in politics.""

Trump said his son listened as adoption was discussed and ""zero happened"" at the meeting when it came to damaging information on Clinton.

He then raised questions about why the Russian attorney was allowed in the country.

""Somebody said her visa or her passport to come into the country was approved by Attorney General Lynch. Maybe that's wrong, I just heard that a little while ago. I was surprised to hear it. So she was here because of Lynch,"" he said.

Fox News has confirmed the Obama administration granted Natalia Veselnitskaya a special type of ""parole"" to be in the United States after she initially was denied a visa. It's unclear whether she still had permission to be in the country when she attended the Trump Tower session in June 2016.

It depends,"['Alan Dershowitz', 'Alan M. Dershowitz Is Felix Frankfurter Professor Of Law', 'Emeritus', 'At Harvard Law School. His Latest Book Is']",FOX News,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller will surely be looking into the meeting between Donald Trump, Jr., and a Russian lawyer named Natalia Veselnitskaya. Part of the meeting was also attended by Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, and Paul Manafort, who at the time was running Trump’s campaign. It now seems clear from the emails that the Trump people went to the meeting expecting to be given dirt on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. The question remains, if this is all true, is it criminal?

The first issue that must be addressed by Mueller is whether any existing criminal statutes would be violated by collusion between a campaign and a foreign government, if such collusion were to be proved? Unless there is a clear violation of an existing criminal statute, there would be no crime.

Obviously if anyone conspired in advance with another to commit a crime – such as hacking the DNC – that would be criminal. But merely seeking to obtain the work product of a prior hack would be no more criminal than a newspaper publishing the work product of thefts such as the Pentagon Papers and the material stolen by Snowden and Manning. Moreover, the emails sent to Trump Jr. say that the dirt peddled by Veselnitskaya came from “official documents.” No mention is made of hacking or other illegal activities. So it is unlikely that attendance at the meeting violated any criminal statute.

Perhaps mere collusion by a campaign with a foreign government should be made a crime, so as to prevent future contamination of our elections. But it is not currently a crime.

Whether or not such collusion, if it occurred, is a crime, it is clear that the American people have the right to know whether any sort of collusion –legal or illegal – took place. And, if so, what was its nature.

The Mueller investigation is limited to possible criminal activity. Probing the moral, political or other non-criminal implications of collusion with, or interference by, Russia is beyond the jurisdiction of the special counsel. It is the role of Congress, not the Criminal Division of the Justice Department, to make changes in existing laws. Perhaps mere collusion by a campaign with a foreign government should be made a crime, so as to prevent future contamination of our elections. But it is not currently a crime.

Nor will it be easy to draft a criminal statute prohibiting a campaign from using material provided by a foreign power, without trenching on the constitutional rights of candidates. But this is all up to Congress and the courts, not the special counsel, with his limited jurisdiction.

That is why the entire issue of alleged collusion with, and interference by, the Russians should be investigated openly by an independent nonpartisan commission, rather than by a prosecutor behind the closed doors of a grand jury.

The American people need to know precisely what the Russians tried to do and did – and what, if anything, the Trump campaign knew and did. These issues go beyond a cops-and-robber whodunit. They involve the very essence of our democracy.

The end result of a secret grand jury investigation will be an up or down determination whether to indict or not to indict. If there are no indictments, that will end the matter. The special counsel may issue a report summarizing the results of his investigation, but many experts believe that such reports are improper, since the subjects of the investigation do not have the right to present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury, which typically hears only one side of the case. Beyond any report, there will also be selective leaks, such as the many that have already occurred. Leaks, too, tend to be one-sided and agenda driven.

A public non-partisan commission investigation, or even one conducted by partisans in Congress, would be open for the most part. They would hear all sides of the story, and the public would be able to judge for itself whether there was improper collusion. A commission or Congressional committee could also recommend changes in the law for the future.

The American people need to know precisely what the Russians tried to do and did – and what, if anything, the Trump campaign knew and did. These issues go beyond a cops-and-robber whodunit. They involve the very essence of our democracy."

""This [was] pre-Russia fever. This [was] pre-Russia mania,"" Trump Jr. told Fox News' Sean Hannity. ""I don’t think my sirens went [off] or my antenna went up at this time because it wasn’t the issue that it’s been made out to be over the last nine months, ten months.""

However, the president’s eldest son also described the meeting as ""a nothing,"" adding, ""I wouldn’t have even remembered it until you started scouring through this stuff. It was literally just a wasted 20 minutes, which was a shame.""

The interview constituted the first public statement by Donald Trump Jr. since he posted what he called ""the entire email chain"" of his conversations with music publicist Rob Goldstone setting up the June 2016 meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya on Twitter.

In one of the messages, Goldstone told Trump Jr. that Russian officials were offering ""some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary [Clinton]"" as part of ""Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.""

Trump Jr.’s response email read, in part, ""if it’s what you say I love it.""

""I had been reading about scandals that people were probably underreporting for a long time, so maybe it was something that had to do with one of those things,"" Trump Jr. told Hannity when asked about his reaction to Goldstone’s email. ""I didn’t know if there was any credibility, I didn’t know if there was anything behind it, I can’t vouch for the information. Someone sent me an email. I can’t help what someone sends me. I read it, I responded accordingly.""

Trump Jr. posted the messages in the wake of a series of New York Times reports that revealed more details of the meeting with Veselnitskaya, which was also attended by Paul Manafort, Trump’s then-campaign manager, and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser.

""For me this was opposition research,"" Trump Jr. said. ""They had something, you know, maybe concrete evidence to all the stories I’d been hearing about … so I think I wanted to hear it out. But really it went nowhere and it was apparent that wasn’t what the meeting was about.""

Trump Jr. said that Goldstone apologized to him for wasting his time after the meeting, which lasted approximately 20 minutes.

""I think what happened [is] he sort of goosed up, he built up, there was some puffery to the email, perhaps to get the meeting, to make it happen,"" Trump Jr. said. ""In the end, there was probably some bait-and-switch about what it was really supposed to be about.""

The Times claimed that Trump Jr. tweeted images of the emails after ""he was told NYT was about to publish the contents of the emails.""

Veselnitskaya, who Trump Jr. denied knowing prior to the meeting, told NBC News Tuesday morning that she did not have ""any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton,"" adding, ""It was never my intention to have that.""

When Trump Jr. was asked for his reaction to Veselnitskaya's interview, he said he was ""a little taken aback by her talking about me pressing for the information, but as you can see from the emails, the pretext of the meeting was, 'Hey, we have information.'""

The emails between Trump Jr. and Goldstone contain no evidence that the president’s son was informed of the larger alleged Russian effort to meddle in the U.S. presidential election.

On Tuesday afternoon, President Trump issued a statement supporting his son’s decision to make the email chain public, calling Trump Jr. ""a high-quality person"" and adding ""I applaud his transparency."" The president’s outside legal counsel has repeatedly denied that the elder Trump knew about or attended the meeting.

In his interview Tuesday evening, Trump Jr. also denied telling his father about the Veselnitskaya meeting, saying, ""There was nothing to tell.""

""I think in the grand scheme of the hysteria that’s been talked about over the last eight, nine, ten months with Russia, things are probably different than they were 13 months ago,"" Trump Jr. concluded. ""In retrospect, I know more now, but hindsight’s always 20-20."""

CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST: I’m Chris Wallace.

New revelations about a meeting between Trump family members and Russian operatives shake Washington, just as the Senate gets ready for a make-or-break vote on health care.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer. Most people would've taken that meeting.

REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALI., MINORITY LEADER: That’s just an arrogant disregard for what is ethical.

WALLACE (voice-over): We’ll discuss how Donald Jr.'s meeting affects the potential case against the president with Jay Sekulow, a member of the Trump legal team.

Then, Republicans make changes to their health care bill, but some in the party say it's still not enough.

SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KENTUCKY: I can't vote for something that doesn't repeal ObamaCare and doesn't fix it.

WALLACE: We’ll ask Senator Rand Paul, one of the biggest critics of the bill, what more needs to be done to finally replace ObamaCare.

(on camera): Plus, Senate Republicans put off a vote this week as one of their own deals with his own health issue.

(voice-over): We’ll ask our Sunday panel what happens if the GOP fails to keep a major promise.

All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington.

First, some breaking news: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has put off that big health care about this week while Senator John McCain recovers from surgery to remove a blood clot from above his left eye. We’ll have much more on the effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare a little later.

First, our top story. For months, Donald Trump and his team have tried to put questions about links to Russian interference in the election behind them. But that is now much tougher with a stream of revelations about a meeting Donald Trump, Jr., and other campaign officials held with Russian operatives last summer, expecting to get damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

How does this affect the credibility of the Trump White House? And what does it mean for at least four investigations into possible collisions?

Joining me now is Jay Sekulow, a member of the president's legal team.

Jay, since the story first broke about possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia, the president and his team have repeatedly dismissed this as a hoax and fake news. Here are a few examples.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, JR., SON OF PRESIDENT TRUMP: It's disgusting, it's so phony. That exactly goes to show you what the DNC and what the Clinton camp will do. They will lie and do anything to win.

PRESIDENT TRUMP: I have nothing to do with Russia, and even -- for anything. What do I have to do with Russia?

WALLACE: Was there any contact in any way between Trump or his associates and the Kremlin or cutouts they had?

MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATE: Of course not. Why would there be any contacts between the campaign?

PRESIDENT TRUMP: The entire thing has been a witch hunt and there is no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign. But I can only speak for myself and the Russians, zero.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Jay, do you now acknowledge that all of those denials are at the very least suspect?

JAY SEKULOW, TRUMP LEGAL TEAM: No, you’ve got to put them in context of what the president said and exactly what took place here, Chris. I think it's important to put the framework here. How did we end up with a special counsel?

Here's how: the former FBI director, was the FBI director at the time, James Comey, had a series of meetings with the president of the United States. In those meetings, he took notes. He put them on his government computer, put them in his government desk, and when he was terminated from position, which you would (ph) acknowledge that the president had the authority to do, he gave them to a friend of his to leak to the press.

So, conversations he had with the president of the United States --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Jay, I’m aware of the history, but this doesn't have anything to do with my question, which is whether or not -- whether or not there were contacts.

(CROSSTALK)

SEKULOW: Chris, it has everything --

WALLACE: Can you answer the question? Does this --

SEKULOW: I’m going to answer your question, I am, and you're going to let me answer it. So, I’m going to finish what I was saying.

WALLACE: It depends on how long we’re going to take to get there.

SEKULOW: Not long. Chris, he leaked the information for one purpose and one purpose only to his friend, and he said to get a special counsel and the special counsel is appointed. So, the entire premise upon which this entire investigation has been based was based on illegally leaked information, including conversation with the president the president of the United States, and today, it's announced that James Comey has signed a book deal where he's going to discuss all this.

You tell me you think that's OK?

WALLACE: I’m not asking about any of that. I’m asking about --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Wait a minute, Jay, you said let me let you finish, now let me finish.

The question I’m asking you is very simple. The president, his vice president, his son repeatedly denied any contacts with the Russians. Given what we've learned this week about the contact between a number of top campaign officials, including the president's son, are all those denials that that's just fake news and a hoax, are those suspect?

SEKULOW: I just answer the question on why -- the president's statements have been clear on what this was involving in his view, and I gave you just now the analysis on how in fact this investigation started.

WALLACE: But that’s not the question I asked. But let’s go if we can --

(CROSSTALK)

SEKULOW: Chris, let's not go through that again. It was the question you asked --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: No, it wasn't. The question you -- the question I asked you, Jay, is whether or not the denials are suspect? I didn't ask you about James Comey.

SEKULOW: I do not think the denials are suspect. I do not think the denial by the president of the United States is suspect at all.

WALLACE: Here's the email exchange in June of 2016 between Don, Jr., setting up the meeting between Don, Jr., and the Russians.

Rob Goldstone writes: The crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high-level and sensitive information that is part of Russia and its government support for Mr. Trump.

Don, Jr. responds: If that’s what you say -- if it's what to say, I love it, especially later in the summer.

Doesn't that contradict the denial of any contact between the Trump campaign and the Russians?

SEKULOW: I mean, what it states was that there was going to be a meeting -- you said the Russians, this was a lawyer who was Russian. That was -- this was a lawyer who ended being -- was Russian. And what took place at that meeting, and it's been well-reported and you reported this as well, the discussions involving the Magnitsky Act and Russian adoptions. It was quickly ended. It was in the middle of a campaign.

And, look, this idea that -- it may have involved opposition research which never materialized evidently. The fact is, you know, that the Ukrainians at the very same time or working with the DNC and the Clinton campaign to get, what, opposition research on Donald Trump and his associates.

WALLACE: But --

SEKULOW: So, everybody's acting as if -- OK. Go ahead.

WALLACE: Well, what I was going to say is, doesn't it indicate -- you say, well, it was a meeting about adoption, we’ll get to that in a moment.

SEKULOW: Yes.

WALLACE: But he fact of the matter is, the reason that Don, Jr. went into that room and Jared Kushner went into that room and Paul Manafort went into that room was not to talk about adoption, it’s because they had been promised --

SEKULOW: Right.

WALLACE: -- they’ve been promised by Rob Goldstone that there would be information as part of the Russian government's effort to tip the election to President Trump.

SEKULOW: Yes, and, of course, nothing in that meeting that would have taken place, even if it was about the topic of an opposition research paper from a Russian lawyer is a legal or a violation of the law. And, by the way, I’m not the only lawyer -- and you know this, Chris -- most lawyers, many, I would say a vast majority of lawyers that you’ve interviewed and others have interviewed on your network and other networks, have acknowledged that the meeting itself and those proposed discussion would not have been a violation of the law.

WALLACE: But the point is, it does show intent, willingness, perhaps not actual collusion because apparently, and, in fact, none of us know what really went on to the meeting, but assuming that at least on that point everybody is telling the truth, doesn't it show intent and willingness on the part of Don, Jr., and Jared and Paul Manafort to collude with the Russians?

And let me just point out, Natalia Veselnitskaya was not just some Russian off the street. She had close ties to people in the Kremlin.

SEKULOW: Well, number one, if it was -- the discussion was going to be about -- if it was going to be about Russian opposition research that a Russian lawyer had, the fact is, those goes on -- you know that goes on the campaigns all the time. Opposition research is a big part of campaigning. I just gave you the example --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: It doesn't go on with Russians all the time, Jay.

SEKULOW: Well, now, but, look, this was -- here’s what happened. First of all, nothing happened. There’d be no exchange of information. But in and of itself, that meeting, the relevancy of the differential that you just put forward, the relevancy of whether it was a Russian lawyer or other individuals that Donald Trump, Jr., knew, the fact is what took place during that meeting, even on the basis of the emails as Donald Trump, Jr., laid them out, were not violations of the statutes.

So, when you talk about Russian collusion, colluding to do what? What? Colluding to violate what law?

WALLACE: Well, let's talk about the legality of the meeting.

SEKULOW: Yes.

WALLACE: The U.S. Code, and let's put it up --

SEKULOW: Yes.

WALLACE: -- bars a foreign national of giving money or, quote, thing of value, in connection with an election and it bars anyone from soliciting such assistance.

SEKULOW: Right.

WALLACE: Wasn't the Trump campaign, in agreeing to that meeting, not talking about what happened, but what they thought when they went into that meeting, wasn't it soliciting something of value, which was the Kremlin, as they believed it, the Kremlin’s effort to tip the election to Donald Trump?

SEKULOW: Well, number one, they didn't solicit the meeting and you know that by reviewing the emails. The meeting --

WALLACE: But they agreed to it and --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: They agreed to it and, in fact, Donald Trump said, I love it, and he agreed to the meeting on the 25th floor of Trump Tower.

SEKULOW: The opposition research, if it would have materialized, is not a thing of value. There's never been a case that has said that opposition research is a thing of value.

And, by the way, there’s been FEC lawyers, Federal Election Commission lawyers that have talked about that as well.

So, I think, Chris, you don't conflate -- I don't think it's appropriate to conflate -- the exact transition as it was laid out in those emails, which was not a solicitation by the Trump campaign to get information, it was an offer of opposition research. Compare that to what took place with the Ukrainians and the DNC where they were working in collusion with each other, or when the DNC was leaking to one of the other networks the questions that they were going to ask during the debates.

So, everyone's acting as if there's this massive collusion statute that only applies here. The fact is there is no collusion statute, period.

WALLACE: Well, there are a couple of points here, and one of them is that you seem to be sliding over the fact that this wasn't CNN that was given questions to Hillary Clinton. This was according to the offer that was being made by Rob Goldstone. This was the Kremlin, a hostile power, offering information.

Christopher Wray, the president's own FBI director nominee, saw it this way. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR NOMINEE: To the members of this committee, any threat or effort to interfere with our elections from any nation-state or any non-state actor is the kind of thing the FBI would want to know.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: He is not saying any actual --

SEKULOW: Right.

WALLACE: -- interference. He is saying any offer is something the FBI would want to know. Would you agree that Donald Jr., and Jared and Paul Manafort should have notified the FBI?

SEKULOW: Here’s -- what -- this is what Chris Wray just said. He would investigate any type of involvement of interference.

The president of the United States has said precisely the same thing. He said that on multiple occasions, you could go back and check the record on this, the president said to James Comey, if satellites were doing something -- remember that whole statement?

But here, what do you have? What took place between what we know took place, was not a violation of the law. There's not a violation of the law. The question is, Russia’s other engagement on a global scale, as directed to the United States, that's being investigated.

I -- and the president has asked Vladimir Putin himself about that, talk to him about that, on multiple occasions when they were just at the G20. So, this idea that this -- that what Chris Wray said is somehow inconsistent with what the president said I think is a false narrative. It's not true.

WALLACE: In our --

SEKULOW: They are not inconsistent statements. Yes, go ahead.

WALLACE: You began this interview by going after James Comey for leaking information, for writing a book.

SEKULOW: Yes, yes.

WALLACE: In our last interview last month, you were sharply critical of James Comey and I want to play some of that for you.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEKULOW: I can't discuss that and I would not discuss that with you. Unlike James Comey, who leaks information to the press, I actually respect the attorney-client privilege. Apparently, he did not.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Jay, you said that a couple of times and that interview. Let me ask you, with the attorney-client privilege exists between the president and the FBI director?

SEKULOW: Well, there's the presidential executive privileges and there’s the deliberative privilege. So, there’s two privileges that acquire there.

WALLACE: There’s no attorney -- you would agree there's no attorney-client privilege?

SEKULOW: Well, James Comey is an attorney, but in the case of his conversation --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: But he's not acting as an attorney. He is acting as FBI director.

SEKULOW: Right. But you --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: He doesn't work as the personal attorney for the president.

SEKULOW: No, of course not.

WALLACE: Well, OK, so that’s --

SEKULOW: But he has -- he held it, Chris, I want to be clear, he has an executive privilege, no one denies that there was a privilege that existed between the president of the United States and James Comey, and James Comey willfully, without the consent of the White House or the president, released information that was covered by that privilege.

WALLACE: But he doesn’t -- the point --

SEKULOW: That's illegal.

WALLACE: -- the point I’m trying to make, Jay, that when you suggest that James Comey violated attorney-client privilege that really misunderstands the role of the FBI director. He's not the president's private lawyer.

SEKULOW: Chris, I have the attorney-client privilege, and that was the context of what I said. I have the attorney-client privilege. Unlike James Comey, I respect the attorney-client privilege as James Comey should have respected the executive privilege and the deliberative privilege that he waved, which he had no authority to do, in order to get evidently a special counsel and a book deal.

WALLACE: One final question -- well, he got the book deal because he got fired by the president. Who’s --

SEKULOW: Do you think -- OK, do you think it's OK that in the book deal, according to the press reports, that he's going to go into details on his conversations with the president? Do you think that's good? Do you think that's OK?

WALLACE: I asked the questions. You answer them, Jay. Let me ask you --

SEKULOW: You won't answer that one. OK, go ahead. Go ahead.

WALLACE: Let me ask you one final question, and I hope you can answer this. Who's paying you and all of the outside lawyers?

SEKULOW: So, I am retained by the main law firm that's involved in the representation of the president and that is the Kasowitz firm. I’m retained of counsel. So, our billing that I would do for this kind of case goes to his firm and they pay us.

WALLACE: Yes. But you're kind of ducking the question. Who's paying them?

SEKULOW: No, no, I don’t --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Obviously, Marc Kasowitz is paying you. Who’s paying them?

SEKULOW: That situation is between Mr. Kasowitz’s firm and whoever is paying, whatever entities paying them. We are sub-paid by the -- we’re just of counsel. So, I can't give you -- I’m not in privity of contract as we say in the law with a person or the organization that's paying for bills to the Kasowitz firm.

WALLACE: Do you know if President Trump is personally paying for his private legal defense? Because the reason I ask is --

SEKULOW: I don’t know.

WALLACE: -- there’s talk that the campaign committee is paying. There is talk about an effort to have the RNC pay.

SEKULOW: Yes.

WALLACE: So, this is an issue.

SEKULOW: Yes. But that’s -- none of those would be illegal or outside the norm. I mean, that happens in these cases. I can’t answer your question because I don’t know.

WALLACE: I’m just trying to get an answer.

SEKULOW: Yes. Well, I don’t -- I’m not in privity of contract, as we say, with the party that’s responsible for the actual payment of the bill. I’m just of counsel to the Kasowitz firm for the purposes of this case.

WALLACE: Well, Jay, I think it went better than last time and, you know, we’re going to still keep trying to get this --

SEKULOW: Well, I don't mind a good joust. A good joust is all right, even early in the morning.

WALLACE: Jay, thank you. Thanks for your time this Sunday.

SEKULOW: Thank you, Chris. I appreciate it.

WALLACE: Up next, we’ll bring in our Sunday group to discuss whether the Don, Jr. meeting is more fake news or the first hard evidence this is a real scandal.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP, JR.: I’m more than happy to be transparent and I’m more than happy to cooperate with everyone.

SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: So, as far as you know, as far this is incident is concerned, this is all of it?

TRUMP, JR: This is everything. This is everything.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Donald Trump Jr. telling Sean Hannity he had disclosed the full story about his meeting with a Russian lawyer that was three days before we learned there was someone else in the room with reported links to Soviet intelligence.

And it's time now for our Sunday group. Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, one of the architects of ObamaCare and author of the new book ""Prescription for the Future."" Julie Pace, Washington bureau chief of The Associated Press and the head of Heritage Action for America, Michael Needham.

Well, Julie, how badly does the White House -- officials in the White House, think all the revelations this week about the Don, Jr. meeting, how badly has a damage their effort to sideline this whole thing as fake news?

JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: Well, in terms of sidelining it, I think this does a lot of damage. And when you talk to White House officials after the first couple of revelations about this meeting, there was a change. You could tell that they knew that this was more serious.

They knew that this was going to be harder to talk their way out of for a couple reasons. One, we're talking with the president's son. Two, we're talking about actual emails that say in black and white that they were told this was part of a Russian government to help Trump.

And three, the president’s son then released those emails himself. So, it wasn’t anonymous sources. It wasn't something that could blame on the intelligence agencies and say it was coming from disgruntled officers.

I do think the overall strategy from the White House, as you saw from the president's lawyer, is going to be to fight back, to try to say that even though you see these emails, even though you know this meeting happen, there was nothing there. And to continue to deny that there is any -- there is any reason for any of these committees and the Mueller investigation to continue.

WALLACE: I get -- I have an understanding that there really is a lot of disarray, that these legal teams, particularly the legal team for Don Jr., and the legal team for Jared are at cross purposes as to how to handle this, that nobody in the White House feels they can coordinate, because if they do talk to the outside lawyers, they’re going to end up being called to testify before the committee.

And I also understand that there is growing concern about the kind of dual role of Jared and Ivanka. Are they top officials? Are they family? Are they in -- particularly in Jared's case, potential subjects of an investigation? This becomes very, very hard for a White House to manage.

PACE: This is really complicated internally, because you have people who have interests that are starting to diverge, who are all working in the White House who are related to the president and they have their own legal teams. And these legal teams are looking out for the client. And if your client is Jared Kushner, that is your top priority, not the president of the United States, despite the fact that Jared Kushner is married to the president's daughter. Don Jr., he’s going to have a legal team that is going to be focused on his interest.

And, frankly, a lot of people in the White House think the president's legal team has not been doing the president a great service at this point.

WALLACE: Here's how President Trump defended the Donald Jr. meeting this week?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: It's called opposition research, or even research into your opponent. I’ve had many people. I have only been in politics for two years. But I’ve had many people call up, oh gee, we have information on this factor or this person or frankly, Hillary. That's very standard in politics.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Brit, does that explanation fly -- and as a veteran, as I am, of a lot of Washington scandals that we have covered -- how damaging do you think this week’s revelations were?

BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: The revelations are damaging in one particular sense, which is it means that there's no end in sight for this firestorm. And once you have, as Julie was explaining and you were pointing out, all these people getting lawyers and preparing to testify and all the rest of it, the burden on the White House is enormous. There was already a burden on this White House to fight these allegations. Whether they add up to anything illegal is a separate matter from what I’m talking about. I’m talking about the political consequence of this, which is very serious because it means that this is the atmosphere in which this administration and this White House is going to have to operate going forward.

And then it begins to matter, Chris, about how well staff the White House is, how will staff the administration is, and all the rest of it. An administration and White House can become paralyzed by this kind of thing. And that -- that among other things is one of the dangers faced here. The explanation the president gave just isn't sufficient.

DR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Chris, it is worth noting that this isn't the first time Russia has tried to influence American elections. It goes back to the 1960s, and we’ve had multiple cases where they tried to actually influence. The Kennedy versus Nixon, Al Gore versus Bush. And every time they've approached some other candidates, they've spurned it or turned it over to the FBI.

So, the notion that the president says this is opposition research and everyone does it, it’s not true. People do have standards. There are rules of engagement and getting a foreign government to try to give you dirty information is something that the American political system hitherto has not permitted. So, that notion is wrong.

WALLACE: Let me just pick up on that one point. We’ll get back to it in a second with Michael, because I think it’s fair to say you have been generally supportive of President Trump.

But doesn't this set of emails and the fact that this meeting -- here are the people who were in the meeting, Don Jr., Jared Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, doesn't the email exchange and the fact that those three Trump officials showed up at the meeting show at least an intent, a willingness to collude?

MICHAEL NEEDHAM, CEO, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA: Well, there was a willingness to accept opposition research from a foreign agent, and that’s something that should be concerning. I thought it was interesting. I agree with what Zeke said, except he conveniently left out Ted Kennedy in 1983 try to work with the Russians to defeat Ronald Reagan, which in no way justifies anybody working with the Russians right now to get opposition research, but I think that’s what it shows.

I think that’s why all Americans recognizing that Russia is a foreign actor, a hostile foreign actor, are supportive of these investigations, and the country deserves to see what comes out of the investigation. The challenge that those of us who care about policy phase is how, with all of this going on, to get the necessary attention, as we’ll talk in the second panel about health care and taxes and other issues. But clearly, these are investigations that need to go on and are going on and we look forward to seeing the results.

WALLACE: Since you’re a panelist, I’m not going to call your Dr. Emanuel. I’m going to call you Zeke.

EMANUEL: That’s fine.

WALLACE: How far as a committed Democrat are you prepared to go? Because -- I mean, we aren’t going to talk in specifics. But are you willing to see the country paralyzed for the next year? Are you willing -- if -- and I repeat -- if more information comes out to see the president impeached, how far do we need to go on this?

EMANUEL: Well, we have -- democracy is at stake here in America. Having our biggest enemy, Russia, come in and try to meddle and change our election that is the bedrock of democracy. That is the most important thing.

I do not want to see this country paralyzed, but I do not want to see our democracy undermined by having the president of the United States colluding and his officials colluding with Russia.

And, remember, there are -- you know, when people go into government, they actually have to abide by the laws here. And one of the laws is you can't get anything of value, whether money or other things of value from a foreign country.

WALLACE: Let me just bring --

EMANUEL: Opposition research is true, it's of value. It may not be dollar value.

WALLACE: Well, I was going to say, you heard what Jay Sekulow had to say about that. No response to Zeke?

NEEDHAM: I mean, he's grandstanding.

We should allow the investigation to play out. We should look at what happens when the investigation plays out and then we should have a discussion right now, the -- you know, emotion that was just displayed was nice, but it's grandstanding until the facts come out.

EMANUEL: Democracy is a very fragile thing. We have seen in other countries. Turkey is a very good example of how someone can win an election and totally undermine democracy by taking down judicial independence, the press, and reelection.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Let me just say, grandstanding has gone before on this panel, you have 15 seconds.

HUME: I have a hunch here that American democracy has survived this effort, and we don't really know how far it went. We don't know whether it had any real noticeable impact on election or any of that. And it seems to me, to become kind of overwrought about the fact that our democracy is in peril because of all this is a little premature at least.

WALLACE: Panel, we have to take a break here. We’ll see you all a little later.

Up next, Senate Republicans struggle to hold a crucial vote on health care, but does the bill do enough to repeal and replace ObamaCare?

One of the plan's biggest critics, Senator Rand Paul, joins us next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Coming up, Senate Republicans continue to make changes to their health care bill, but some in the party still aren't happy.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KENTUCKY: Unfortunately, the new plan actually doesn't repeal ObamaCare. That promise to repeal ObamaCare, not to continue ObamaCare.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Senator Rand Paul joins us next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: A look outside the beltway at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where the world's top female golfers are competing in today's final round of the U.S. Women's Open.

Well, last night Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put off consideration of health care legislation this week after it was announced that Senator John McCain had surgery to remove a blood clot from above his left eye. Republicans are struggling to pass a revised bill, which some say still doesn't go far enough to repeal and replace ObamaCare.

Joining me know, one of the biggest critics, Senator Rand Paul.

Senator, let's start with the bottom line. Whenever it comes up, whenever Senator McCain is in good health and comes back, does Senator -- Senate Majority Leader McConnell have the votes to pass this revised bill?

PAUL: You know, I don't think right now he does. And the -- the real problem we have is, you know, we won four elections on repealing ObamaCare, but this bill keeps most of the ObamaCare taxes, keeps most of the regulations, keeps most of the subsidies, and create something that Republicans have never been before, and that’s a giant insurance bailout superfund. That's not a Republican idea to give taxpayer money to a private industry that already makes $15 billion in profit.

WALLACE: So if this bill does not pass, what happens?

PAUL: Well, you know, what I've suggested to the president, and I talked to the president again, you know, when he was in Paris just this last weekend or I guess on Friday, and I’ve told him, I think we can still -- if -- you know, if this comes to an impasse, I think of the president comes -- jumps into the fray and says, look, guys, you promised to repeal it, let's just repeal what we can agree to and then we can continue to try to fix, replace or whatever has to happen afterwards.

But the one thing we should do is try to repeal as many of the taxes, as many of the regulations, and as many of the mandates as we possibly can. I still think the entire 52 of us could get together on a more narrow, clean repeal, and I think it still can be done.

WALLACE: Now, this isn’t change of heart, because back in January you said that you had told the president, and he agreed with you, that you needed to repeal and replace at the same time?

PAUL: Well, you know, it's interesting that it's not. I'm still for replace, it's just my definition of replace is a lot different than some of the big government Republicans. My idea always was to replace it with freedom, legalize choice, legalize inexpensive insurance, allow people to join associations to buy their insurance. I'm still for all of those. And I think those could actually be part of clean repeal. In fact, most of the ideas I've had on letting people join groups to buy their insurance, you know, letting the plumber and his wife join a large group like the chamber of commerce, those ideas are actually welcomed by virtually every Republican. That passed in the House of Representatives unanimously.

WALLACE: Here's what President Trump says in his weekly address this weekend about the merits of the current, new revised bill.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The Senate health care bill stops the ObamaCare disaster, expand choice and drives down cost.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Is the president wrong, senator?

PAUL: You know, I would caution about overselling what's going to happen. I've been involved with health care for 20 years as a physician. It was in terrible shape before ObamaCare. It got worse under ObamaCare. And I predict that the fundamental flaw of ObamaCare will remain with the Republican plan. And this is a big reason why I can't support it.

The fundamental flaw is that mandates on insurance cause prices to rise and young, healthy people then say, hey, I’ll just wait until I get sick and the insurance pool gets sicker and sicker. It’s called adverse selection. We also call it the death spiral. The Republican plan admits that it will continue. If they just say, hey, guys, we’re going to subsidize it. We’re going to dump billions of dollars into the insurance companies and say, please charge less and try to counteract the death spiral. But the Republican plan doesn't fix the death spiral of ObamaCare, it simply subsidizes it.

WALLACE: Yes, I understand, and I think everybody would agree that this bill does not repeal ObamaCare, it does not fix all of the problems with it. But here is why conservatives say it is still worth supporting. It is, they contend, the most significant Medicaid reform ever. It turns an open-ended entitlement into a block grant for states. Compare the current law, it cuts Medicaid spending $772 billion by 2026. Are you willing, senator, to see all of that go down the drain?

PAUL: I think that some of the Medicaid reform is probably good. Slowing down the rate of growth is what they do to Medicaid. They don't actually cut. So I think that's the wrong term to use. But they do slow down the rate of growth. It -- a lot of the slow down rate of growth doesn't kick in till years seven, eight, nine, and ten.

And I’ve seen the way things work in Washington. And the sad thing is, we do these 10-year plans that kind of remind me of the Soviet’s five-year agricultural plans. They’re kind of a fiction. We do the things in the first two or three, four or five years and then by the time we get to seven or eight or year nine, there’s a new Congress. Maybe those are Democrats. And then the whole Medicaid reform goes out the window.

But the bottom line is, I'm not willing to trade Medicaid reform for an insurance company bailout, an insurance company entitlement. They call it a temporary stabilization fund of nearly $200 billion. It's never going away because they do not fix the death spiral of ObamaCare. The death spiral of ObamaCare will remain with the Republican plan. And that’s ask I just can't support it as it's written.

WALLACE: Now, you say that given the balance of power and the -- and the way the votes are lining up, that you’d like to see a straight repeal at this point and then try to fix it later. Your Republican colleagues say, one, there are not 51 votes for a straight repeal and, two, if you do that, and then you, as you say, try to fix it later, then because it’s not going to be part of budget reconciliation, you’re going to need 60 votes, you’re going to have to work with Democrats, and you’re going to end up with a lot of stuff that's even more liberal.

PAUL: Well, there is a way we can do it. We do a more narrow, clean -- cleaner repeal. But we can also, at the same time, put forward a bill that has some of the big-ticket spending items that conservatives object to. I will vote against that.

But there are many bills that all the Democrats always vote for. If it has government spending on it, Democrats vote for it. So there's a chance we could take the things that I object to on the repeal bill that aren’t repeal, that are big government spending, put them in a bill the Democrats typically vote for, one is called SCHIP. It’s a reaffirmation of like Medicaid for children. It will be a big spending bill. And if they want to spend billions on bailing out the insurance company, they could do that with Democrats because in all likelihood Democrats will vote for that. Conservatives will vote against an insurance bailout, but we’d have a clean repeal and then we’d have a spending bill. They can actually be advanced simultaneously really on the same day. Moderates would get what they want, which is more debt for the country and more spending. Conservatives will get what we want, a clean repeal, which is really the only thing we promised in the election and we promised it over and over again. So it kind of annoys me that Republicans are going back on their word to repeal ObamaCare.

WALLACE: Let’s do a lightning rod, quick questions, quick answers, because there are a number of ideas as it looks like the Senate Republicans may be deadlocked on what can be done to try to break the logjam.

First of all, Ted Cruz has gotten a measure put into the bill that says that insurers can put out skinnier -- what they call skinnier, cheaper plans, fewer benefits for healthy people as long as they put out one -- at least one plan that all -- has all of the health benefits required by ObamaCare. What's wrong with that?

PAUL: I'm for more choice, so in general I've been supportive of the Cruz Amendment. However, the Cruz Amendment will still be in the context of having the fundamental flaw of ObamaCare, which are all these mandates. So adverse selection will continue even with the Cruz Amendment and some have argued it would be made worse.

Cruz himself says, oh, you know what, we’re going to have to increase government subsidies to insurance companies to stabilize prices. Well, that’s just not a very Republican idea to have taxpayer money going to a private industry. The insurance companies make $15 billion a year. So I'm generally for the idea of the amendment because it gives more freedom, but it's in the context of a bill that still has the fundamental flaw, still retains the death spiral of ObamaCare. So, ultimately, I won't work.

And I tell people, they don’t -- people don’t -- Republicans don't understand this, when they pass this, they are going to completely own health care. And people are -- have been unhappy with health care ever since I've been in medicine, one, because of the large sort of bullying way that we’re treated by insurance companies deny everything.

You know, my family alone, we fight tooth and nail to get our insurance company to cover anything. I'm like the rest of America, we’re frustrated with insurance companies charging us through the roof and then not paying for the stuff that we need when we go to the doctor.

WALLACE: Senator -- senator, let me just explain again the idea of the lightning round is quick questions and quick answers.

So let me -- let me ask you one other --

PAUL: That was a quick one.

WALLACE: Let me ask you one other quick one, which was that Senators Cassidy and Graham are now saying go the federalism route and let each side -- each state decide what they want. Here it is.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-SOUTH CAROLINA: We’re going to take that $500 billion and through some kind of formula give it to the state and say the following. If you want to repair ObamaCare, you can repair it. If you want to replace it, you can replace it.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Briefly, what's wrong with that?

PAUL: Well, the problem is, is ObamaCare was a trillion dollar tax increase. If you tell me it's federalism to increase taxes by a trillion dollars collective in Washington and then send them back to be spent by the states, that's not really federalism. Federalism would be devolving the power and the size and scope of the federal government to the states, and I'm all for that.

But I think their proposal with -- I don't know exactly what it is as far as what we’ll do with the regulations. Does it wipe out all the regulations of ObamaCare? What happens to the regulation? So I -- I -- it sounds like a nonstarter.

WALLACE: I think it’s up to the states. Let me ask you one -- let me ask you one last question. I've got 30 seconds left for this one.

Some of your colleagues say, look, you’re -- if this goes down, you're going to end up with ObamaCare, because this is it. It's either this or ObamaCare. You’d rather keep ObamaCare?

PAUL: I think that the current system is terrible. The death spiral of ObamaCare is unwinding the whole system and it will continue to unwind. But I don't think Republican should put their name on this, keep part of ObamaCare and then we’re going to be blamed for the rest of the unwinding of ObamaCare. It's a really bad, political strategy and it’s not going to fix the problem.

WALLACE: Senator Paul, thank you. Thanks for joining us.

PAUL: Thank you.

WALLACE: And we’ll watch what happens on The Hill when it finally does come to a vote. And it's always a pleasure to talk with you, sir.

PAUL: Thank you.

WALLACE: Up next, we’ll bring back our Sunday group to handicap Republican chances to repeal and replace ObamaCare.

Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the GOP’s revised health care bill? Just go to Facebook or Twitter @foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PRESET: But I’m sitting, waiting for that bill to come to my desk. I hope that they do it. They've been promising it for years. Mitch has to pull it off. He's working very hard. He's got to pull it off.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: President Trump putting the onus on Senate Republican leaders to fulfill one of his major campaign promise to repeal ObamaCare. And we’re back now with the panel.

Julie, I’ve got to say, I was struck by the president saying that he’s sitting there at his desk waiting for the bill to come there. I know he's made a few calls, but this sure seems different from Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton actively lobbying, bringing people in. I mean, am I wrong or is --

PACE: You’re not wrong. There -- there is not a lot of hands-on effort happening by the president certainly on the details of the legislation. He’s made a couple of phone calls. He has done a few interviews where he’s talked about this. But when it comes to the actual policy details in this legislation, it's a hands-off strategy.

But, frankly, Republicans are not that upset about it. They actually would prefer that he not start meddling with the details on this. What they would like to see him do, though, is try to use the bully pulpit that he does have, the audience that he does have on Twitter, to sell the bill.

They see him do this sometime and be pretty off message. He’s talked about trying to put more money in the bill, which is not exactly a Republican argument. He has talked about, you know, trash the House bill, which he was -- was so in favor of.

WALLACE: Said it was mean.

PACE: Said it was mean. So what Republicans would like is for him to stay out of the policy details but try to at least sell this to the American people.

WALLACE: Brit, we may be surprised, but I think you would agree that whenever this bill does come up for a vote, probably not this week but maybe next week or the week after, that passing it is a bit of a long shot. And I guess my question is, how come?

HUME: Well, I would look at it a little bit differently, Chris. It seems to me that -- you remember when the first version of this measure came out --

WALLACE: Right.

HUME: And about a dozen or so senators made it plain they -- they couldn't vote for it. So it goes back for a little rehab and it comes out again and we have -- we’re down to where two or three Republicans get it. That doesn't mean all the rest of them who were for -- who were against it before will vote for it, but it suggests to me that considerable progress has been made and that the Republican leadership in the Senate is now quite close to where they can pass the bill.

So when it gets down to it, the question you asked Rand Paul at the end of your interview with him is a question every Republican senator is going to have to face, and that is to say any -- when it gets down to it, are you going to cast a vote, the effective of which is to leave ObamaCare fully in place? And, you know, remember when those House members all resisted the first version of the House bill and they all went home? I think they thought they were going to be heroes. They weren't. And the result was, was fairly minor changes. That bill ultimately passed. I think there's a significant chance that will happen here as well.

WALLACE: In the time that we have left, I want to try to drill down into the relative merits of the current system versus the revised Senate bill. And here’s what President Trump had to say this weekend.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: We are very, very close to ending this health care nightmare. We are so close. The legislation working its way through Congress provides the choice and control people want, the affordability they need and the quality they deserve in health care.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Zeke, I want to get you into a debate with your policy counterpart here, Michael Needham, and -- and I'm going to let you go first. Is the president wrong? When it comes to the question of ObamaCare versus the current Senate bill, why is ObamaCare better?

EMANUEL: Well, the current Senate bill will throw 22 million people off of insurance and --

WALLACE: But we don't know that. That was the -- the --

EMANUEL: It will. Look, it's going to throw at least over 15 million, because that's the Medicaid part. So it's going to throw something like 22 million people off of insurance. Second, it totally undermines the insurance marketplace with the Cruz Amendment. It actually makes the bill worse because the adverse selection Rand Paul was talking about will be even worse. Health --

WALLACE: That -- that -- that says that healthy people can buy cheap plans, sick people have to go for the full plan.

EMANUEL: And basically it undermines the freedom of cancer patients that I take care of because they will not be able to afford any health insurance given the Cruz proposal and all.

WALLACE: But what about the subsidies that are in the Cruz --

EMANUEL: They’re not -- any -- everyone knows they’re inefficiently distributed and they’re nowhere near enough.

And the third point I would make is, $45 billion for opioid care over ten years may sound like a lot of people to people, but it's the president's own commission says they need over $220 billion. So it’s 20 percent. So you’ve got high insurance, undermining of the insurance market, and you don't solve the opioid crisis. It's a terrible bill.

WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on Facebook

On the new revised Senate Republican bill from Marc Hall who writes, ""repeal the ACA,"" Affordable Care Act, ""as promised. Do not fix. Repeal it outright. What is wrong with the free market and patient choice, just like we have in auto insurance.""

Michael, how do you answer Marc and how do you answer Zeke on this question of whether the revised bill is better or worse than the current system?

NEEDHAM: Yes, I mean, Mark’s exactly actually right, the problem when you talk to people in the Senate is, there’s probably at this point only 15 or 20 votes in the Senate for full repeal of ObamaCare. For seven years the Republican Party promised full repeal of ObamaCare. We need to move towards a patient centered free market plan. This bill doesn’t do it. And it’s because, unfortunately, the Republican Party wasn't serious about repeal. And that's a tragedy. And it means that the --

WALLACE: Is it -- so are you saying that we should leave ObamaCare in place or we -- should we go for this?

NEEDHAM: No. I think this bill is the first step in a process of repealing ObamaCare.

WALLACE: And why is Zeke wrong?

NEEDHAM: Zeke’s wrong because Zeke’s doing what a lot of people in Washington, D.C., do, and he's playing baseline games and he’s looking at these things. The CBO said 23 million people would be in the individual markets because of the employer mandate, the individual mandate. It turns out there’s only ten. When the CBO scores this, they assume that magically it's a bill from 10 million people in the individual market up to 16 million people before they even do some scoring. And so he's playing games on that side.

On the Medicaid expansion, this bill --

EMANUEL: Wait a second. Wait -- hold on. The Medicaid expansion is real. Taking $800 billion out of Medicaid is not going to expand the number of people who are covered.

NEEDHAM: (INAUDIBLE).

EMANUEL: And the second point I would make is, there is no freedom in this bill for people who have pre-existing conditions. This completely removes the promise to them that if you have a pre-existing condition you can have affordable insurance.

WALLACE: OK. Michael?

NEEDHAM: So the problem is Zeke’s point, is that this bill actually keeps all -- the -- not all, it takes away what was created by Dr. Emanuel and others, which was an incentive in Medicaid to insure able-bodied people for states who have more able-bodied people rather than more vulnerable populations, like the disabled. It takes away that dis-incentive, but it actually keeps the federal subsidy for the Medicaid expansion population. And so Zeke’s not being entirely fair on that point.

HUME: And -- and remember this, Chris, the triumph of ObamaCare is this coverage for pre-existing conditions, which basically defeats the whole idea of insurance, which is -- for example, in the automobile insurance market, if you could wait till you had a wreck and then buy insurance and have the repairs cover, that's comparable to what we're doing here.

EMANUEL: But, Brit, if I have cancer --

HUME: Let me finish. Hold on, let me finish. Can I please finish?

WALLACE: We’ve got 90 second (ph).

HUME: The idea of insurance is that you purchase it to guard against risks and things that may occur in the future. It's not that you purchase the coverage after you’re already sick.

EMANUEL: But if --

HUME: So that -- so once -- once that idea is gone, ObamaCare is essential it remains.

WALLACE: You’ve got -- you’ve got 20 seconds.

EMANUEL: If I have cancer, through no fault of my own, I didn’t hit a car, I need to have insurance to cover me. This bill does nothing for those people. It only makes the price of their insurance ever higher. Cancer patients and patients with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease get completely --

WALLACE: Gentlemen --

EMANUEL: Written out of coverage by this bill.

WALLACE: We are -- we are not going to settle this. And, guess what, we don't have to because we’re going to have more time to talk about it. But let's bring you all back and have the conversation.

Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.

Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" the man behind Donald Trump's tweets.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Remember when President Trump took office and people wondered whether he would give up Twitter? Well, as we told you back in February, that was never a question for the president and one trusted aide. Here's our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DAN SCAVINO, WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF SOCIAL MEDIA: Just directly reaching out to what we call the Trump train out there, the movement, and delivering your message directly to the American people.

WALLACE (voice-over): Dan Scavino is describing his job as White House director of social media. Getting Donald Trump's message out unfiltered by the press or anyone else. When the president took office, there was some question whether he would keep tweeting.

TRUMP: Let me ask you, should I keep a Twitter going are not? Keep it going?

WALLACE: And why not? Mr. Trump now has 113 million followers on eight different White house and personal platforms.

WALLACE (on camera): How important is that, that it's his authentic voice reaching directly to the supporters?

SCAVINO: It's very important. It is him speaking, his mind as president of the United States of America.

WALLACE (voice-over): Scavino spends his day near the president.

SCAVINO: He’ll start speaking and tweet, which I know is a tweet, and that we will simply send it out. He's been called the Hemingway of Twitter many times with 140 characters. There’s so many times that he’ll give me a message when we’re traveling or in the office and it stops at 139 characters.

WALLACE: Of course that’s during working hours. Then there are the tweets the president types himself early in the morning or late at night.

SCAVINO: I get a little bing, as we like to say, and I get the tweet and then I’ll take that tweet and amplify it onto Instagram, as well as his Facebook account.

WALLACE: This is the Trump Facebook page, filled with official announcements, presidential musings and behind the scenes video that Scavino takes.

WALLACE (on camera): As he’s dictating a tweet, either in the campaign or now as president, have you ever said to him, maybe not?

SCAVINO: There’s been times, but not too often. But I've always believed in -- and being with the man from day one is, let Trump be Trump.

TRUMP: Did anybody ever hear of Dan? He's become quite famous in social media.

WALLACE (voice-over): Scavino was a mini celebrity on the campaign trail, as one of candidate Trump’s inner circle. But he goes back a lot longer than that. They met when Scavino was 16 working at a country club in suburban New York.

SCAVINO: Often when he would come up, I would either for (ph) caddy or clean his clubs upon departure of the golf course. And he said to me, he said, you’re going to work for me one day.

WALLACE: He ended up running a Trump golf course, but was about to start his own social media business when he heard the boss might run for president.

WALLACE (on camera): Do you ever think to yourself, Dan Scavino, 16-year-old caddy, assistant to the president?

SCAVINO: It's overwhelming. It's surreal. But we’re here. And we’re here to serve the American people.

WALLACE (voice-over): Now Scavino spend more time around Donald Trump than almost any member of his staff, in a relationship that’s close to family.

SCAVINO: He knows I'm there for him. He knows I have his back.

Everything we've been through, nobody is taking more incoming than Donald J. Trump. And to be with him in the foxhole, and it’s just -- just being here in the White House, when everybody said, and I can't say it enough, you he zero chance, Scavino, what are you doing?

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: Like his boss, Scavino takes to his personal Twitter account to defend the administration. He got a warning earlier this year for violating the Hatch Act when he urged Trump supporters to vote against a Republican congressman who opposed the president's policies.

And that's it for today. Have a great week and we’ll see you next ""Fox News Sunday.""

CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST: I’m Chris Wallace.

President Trump is back in Washington after his first meeting with Vladimir Putin. What should we look for in relations between the U.S. and Russia?

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We look forward to a lot of very positive things happening for Russia and the United States and for everybody concerned.

WALLACE (voice-over): In the wake of the G-20 Summit, we’ll discuss where things stand on Syria, Ukraine, Russian meddling in the last election, and the Trump agenda, when we sit down with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus. It’s a ""Fox News Sunday"" exclusive.

(on camera): Then, the Senate returns from recess still confronted with what to do about ObamaCare. Is repeal and replace in trouble?

(voice-over): We’ll ask Republican senator, Dr. Bill Cassidy.

Plus, as North Korea gets closer to a nuclear ICBM, President Trump reaches out again to Chinese President Xi.

TRUMP: I’m sure that whether it’s on trade or whether it’s on North Korea, we will come to a successful conclusion.

WALLACE: We’ll ask our Sunday panel if there's any way to stop Kim Jong-un in his tracks.

All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington.

President Trump is back at the White House after the G-20 summit where he seemed to get along better with Russian President Putin than some of our long-time European allies. So, where do we stand now on foreign hot spots, trade, and climate change? And what about a newly disclosed meeting in 2016 between the president's son, Trump campaign officials, and a Russian lawyer?

In a few minutes, we’ll break it all down with an exclusive interview with the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus.

But, first, let's bring in correspondent Kevin Corke at the White House with the latest -- Kevin.

KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, no matter how far away the president travels from Washington, for example, the 4,000 miles to Hamburg, Germany, this White House is never terribly (ph) far away from the Russian meddling story, it was one of the topics heading into the G-20 and it is again coming out of the G-20.

The president talking about it and tweeting about it once again, this time talk about his meeting with President Vladimir Putin. He tweeted, I strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election, he vehemently denied it. I’ve already given my opinion.

Later, the President tweeting on Sunday: Putin and I discussed forming an impenetrable cybersecurity unit so that election hacking and many other negative things will be guarded.

This as FOX News confirms that Donald Trump, Jr., arranged a meeting at Trump Tower during the campaign with a Russian lawyer with connections to the Kremlin. That meeting he failed to disclose on his federal paperwork but had been noted by other attendees including Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort. We also heard from the Trump legal team that the person who took part in that meeting may have misrepresented herself and who she worked for and may, in fact, have had ties with DNC operatives, very interesting twist in that story.

As for deliverables from the G-20 summit, no surprise the Syrian ceasefire is an obvious one. The president tweeting: now is the time to move forward and working constructively with Russia on that.

Another deliverable, the announced agreement with China to conduct joint military exercises in 2018, Beijing’s obvious attempt to mollify U.S. concerns over the North. On Trade, and the final communique, which acknowledge America's right to seek more trade equity abroad, Mr. Trump tweeted this Sunday: The G-20 Summit, a great success for the U.S. -- explained that the U.S. must fix the many bad trade deals it has made. Will get done.

And the summation also noted America's decision to back out of the Paris climate accord, which it called irreversible. Of course, according to the White House, it’s nonbinding and we’re out -- Chris.

WALLACE: Kevin Corke reporting from the White House -- Kevin, thanks for that.

Joining me now, President Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus.

Reince, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""

REINCE PRIEBUS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I’m happy to be here, Chris.

WALLACE: Right.

Let's start with the breaking news that in June of 2016, there was a previously undisclosed meeting, and let’s up all the players on the screen, Donald Trump, Jr., this was during the campaign, Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior advisor, and then campaign chairman Paul Manafort, met at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin, Natalia Veselnitskaya.

Why did they meet and why are we just learning about it?

PRIEBUS: Well, first of all, Chris, I don't know much about it other than what I’ve communicated with various members there on the screen. It was a very short meeting. It was a meeting apparently about Russian adoption and after about 20 minutes, the meeting ended and that was the end of it.

And as far as nondisclosure, look, Jared Kushner put in his disclosure a little prematurely, he has since amended it. All of that is disclosed, and it was a nothing meeting. And now, what's developing from that meeting, if you look at the article that Circa put out, is that the individual that set up the meeting may have been affiliated with Fusion GPS, which is opposition research firm that is being subpoenaed and talk to by the Senate Judiciary Committee about their role in putting together that phony dossier that people know about in regard to the president.

So, this is a developing story. I don't know much about it other than it seems to be on the end of the Trump individuals a big nothing burger but may spin out of control for the DNC and the Democrats.

WALLACE: Well, let me ask you about two aspects of that. In terms of the DNC, are you suggesting that this was somehow a set up by Democrats to try and link them or compromise them with the Russians? And this was before there was any Russian interference in election. So, why would they have done that?

PRIEBUS: Well, look, why was Fusion GPS involved in putting together this dossier? I don't know, Chris. And I don't think too many people know why or how this meeting came about.

However, what I can tell you is in my communication with our team on the subject, there was nothing to it, it was a 20 minute meeting, it ended after everyone was decidedly sitting there saying there's nothing happening here. They moved on. And I think, in the end, what you’re going to find in the story, if you read the Circa column, because I think there’s more questions on the Democrat side than anywhere else.

WALLACE: And one last question about the meeting, why would Donald Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort all want to meet with a Russian lawyer about Russian adoption?

PRIEBUS: I have no idea, Chris. You’re going to have to talk to them. However, you know, talking about issues of foreign policy, issues related to our place in the world, issues important to the American people, like adoption, is something that's not unusual. So, when you go through a campaign, you’re not just talking to one particular group of people about in this case adoptions in Russia, you have policy teams talking about our place in Asia, talking about trade in China. You have policy teams that run the gamut. It’s not unusual.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: The foreign policy meeting?

PRIEBUS: Apparently so.

WALLACE: OK, I want to clear up, speaking of foreign policy meetings, what really happened in the Putin-Trump summit in Hamburg on Friday. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov says that after Putin denied meddling in election, he, Trump, this is his quote, said that he had accepts these assertions, and that President Trump said, this is Lavrov quoting Trump, certain circles in the U.S. are still exaggerating, although they cannot prove this, the topic of Russia’s interference with the election.

Reince, is that true? Did the president say what Lavrov says he said?

PRIEBUS: No, it’s not true. The president absolutely did not believe the denial of president Putin. What he did his he immediately came into the meeting, talked about Russian meddling in the U.S. election, went after that issue at least two separate times.

This was not just a five-minute piece of the conversation. This was an extensive portion of the meeting and after going at it with President Putin more than once, two times, maybe even three times, the president at that point, after spending a large part of the meeting on the subject, moved on to other topics.

WALLACE: So, to be clear --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: And we’re going to get to that. He does not accept Putin's denial. He believes the Russians meddled?

PRIEBUS: He’s answered this question many times. He said they probably meddled in the election. They did meddle in the election. The one thing that he also says, which drives the media crazy, but it’s an absolute fact, is that others have as well, and that's true. China has, North Korea has and they have consistently over many, many years.

So, yes, he believes that Russia probably committed all of these acts that we've been told of, but he also believes that other countries also participated in this --

WALLACE: Let's move to the next subject, which is, what is the response? What are the consequences for doing that?

I want to put a tweet that your president -- your boss has been very busy on Twitter today. I want to put up this tweet. Now, it is time to move forward and working constructively with Russia.

Does that mean that they’re off the hook as far as Russian meddling is concerned?

PRIEBUS: No, it doesn't mean they’re off the hook, but what it means is, is that we’re not going to forgo progress simply because we have a disagreement in regards to this meddling in the United States election, what it means is that we need to move forward with things like a cease-fire in Syria, which is going to save a lot of lives, which we are doing I think starting today in southwestern Syria. It means we need to move forward with working together with ISIS. We need to move forward with working together in resolving the conflict in Ukraine.

WALLACE: So, how do you --

PRIEBUS: So, you can have -- you can chew gum -- walk and chew gum at the same time, Chris.

WALLACE: How do you respond to Democrats like Chuck Schumer who are saying it's disgraceful that the president comes out of this meeting and basically says, oh, we’re going to move forward?

PRIEBUS: Right. Well, we can solve world peace and world famine and I think Senator Schumer would say the same thing. So, look, they’re programmatic when it comes to trashing the president.

When you look at what President Trump did in Europe and recommitting ourselves to our NATO allies, committing ourselves to our partners in Europe, our partners across the world, committing ourselves to the values of the West, delivering a speech in Poland which many people said are the best speeches since Ronald Reagan. You look at what he did in Hamburg. I mean, other than our small disagreement on trade and the Paris agreement, we have unification with our allies.

WALLACE: All right. Well, I want to get to that with you. But let's talk about one more aspect of the Trump-Putin meeting and that is progress in Syria. They did discuss it. Here is how Secretary of State Rex Tillerson described it afterwards.

(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)

REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE: I would tell you that, by and large, our objectives are exactly the same. Maybe they’ve got the right approach and we got the wrong approach.

(END AUDIO CLIP)

WALLACE: I want to ask about that. The secretary of state says the U.S. and Russia have exactly the same objectives and that maybe they have the right approach and we have the wrong approach. Russia, Putin are backing Assad who has slaughtered hundreds of thousands of civilians, and they may have the right approach?

PRIEBUS: Well, look, I think what he may have been referring to is that Barack Obama put a red line in the sand and didn't actually follow through with the threat that he made in Syria and we find ourselves from -- we find ourselves behind the eight ball in Syria because nothing happened for many, many years and now, we are looking -- from the outside looking in. That all being said, we need to move forward and actually maybe work with Russia on bringing peace to Syria and I think that's what you're seeing the beginning stages of happening.

WALLACE: But they want Assad. They want somebody who, the butcher of Baghdad who was slaughtering hundreds of thousands of people.

PRIEBUS: Maybe not long term. I think it’s yet to be seen what is going to be of Assad. I mean, certainly, he's a butcher and he’s a bad person.

And you've seen President Trump act decisively when it comes to Syria. It didn't take him long to pull the trigger in regard to a response to the chemical attack. That's a decisive leader and that's who the G-20 leaders saw in Hamburg, as someone who is decisive, someone who is not afraid, someone who doesn’t kowtow, and stands up for himself when it comes to issues of disagreement like trade and the Paris agreement.

WALLACE: Let's talk about exactly that subject, because generally at these G-20 summits, the meetings of the world's leading economies, East and West, the U.S. sets the tone. But there were a lot of times, and you just referred to it a couple times, sharp disagreement over climate change, just completely disagree and they kind of papered over the disagreement on trade, which still is there.

Does the president have any trouble when he's one against 19?

PRIEBUS: No, actually, I think the American people should look at that as a massive positive about this president, that you have a president that doesn't just show up at the G-20 and sink into his chair and just suddenly agree with all of these European leaders across the table when it comes to issues that he disagrees on. The president has made it very clear that he doesn't believe the Paris agreement is fair.

Now, you say it's a disagreement. It's really not a disagreement on the environment. It's a disagreement on the Paris agreement itself, and the fact that we don't want to be hamstrung by an agreement that’s going to hurt the American worker across the country that the president has pledged to support. We don’t -- we disagree in regard to trade a little bit and the fact that this president actually believes that trade should be fair, that we shouldn't be taken advantage of.

That’s something the president is standing up for the American people. It should be seen as a positive, Chris.

WALLACE: Let me ask you a specific question on trade because the president may decide in the next few days whether or not to impose tough restrictions on steel imports coming into this country, talk about a possible 25 percent tariff. The head of the European Commission says: We are prepared to take up arms if need be. His reaction to the fact that the president may do this.

Is President Trump ready for an international trade more?

PRIEBUS: Well, OK, first of all, the president does what he says he's going to do. He's been talking about steel, aluminum, cars for 30 years, my entire -- practically my entire life. He is -- he believes in the things that he believes in.

There's also a national security peace to this and the American people need to understand. If a country loses its ability to produce steel, it loses something in regards to national security, a country cannot find itself importing steel from China subjected to dumping of steel from other countries, and decreasing productivity.

WALLACE: I don't mean to interrupt, but --

PRIEBUS: This is an important issue, not just for trade, not just for the American worker, for national security.

WALLACE: But you're making the argument that, yes, he’s going to impose tough restrictions on steel imports.

PRIEBUS: My guess is that he will because he promised that he would.

WALLACE: But then, the Europeans are going to impose tough restrictions.

PRIEBUS: Of course -- maybe they will, maybe they won't --

WALLACE: But they say they will.

PRIEBUS: -- but they can’t take advantage of the United States. Many of these countries have been taking advantage of the United States and part of the reason why President Trump is in the White House is because he told the American people that the time is over for the rest of the world to take advantage of the United States. Now, that all being said --

WALLACE: What happens when they impose -- what happens when they impose tough restrictions on our exports to them and then Americans lose jobs?

PRIEBUS: Other than maybe a few countries, you can't find a trade surplus going the opposite direction from the United States. That all being said, let me just, because we might be running out of time, I want to make it very clear --

WALLACE: We are running out --

PRIEBUS: -- this was a positive meeting. The president set the stage in Europe, the leaders of the G-20 came to the president, he was a star in Hamburg, and no one can take that away. And the fact of the matter is, I think he's placing America first, but with that, strategically aligning our allies and making sure that our objectives across the world and the objectives of western civilization are being met.

WALLACE: One last question. I got about one minute left. We’re over time. Senate coming back this week, going to take up health care. Mitch McConnell is acknowledging that you may not pass repeal and replace, you may have to work with the Democrats to prop up ObamaCare, more Republican senators coming out against it. How much trouble is repeal and replace in?

PRIEBUS: I don't think it's in half as much trouble as the media wanted to be in, just like it wasn't the case when we went through the House bill the second time around, everyone said that it was over and then a few days later it passed. I think that's what you are seeing right now. I think you are seeing members of the Senate putting their wish list together. You have a leader in Mitch McConnell that can get it done. If anyone can get it done, Mitch McConnell, President Trump working together with a Senate, can get it done.

WALLACE: Yes or no, will they pass --

PRIEBUS: Yes.

WALLACE: Yes, what?

PRIEBUS: Yes, they will get a -- they will get a repeal and replace bill done (ph). I believe that.

WALLACE: Before the August recess?

PRIEBUS: Maybe before, maybe a little bit into it, but I know that this president expects them to get this done. Whether it’d be before August recess or during August recess, the president expects the Senate to fulfill the promises it made to the American people.

WALLACE: Reince, thank you. Thanks for your time.

PRIEBUS: You bet.

WALLACE: Always good to talk with you.

PRIEBUS: Thank you, Chris.

WALLACE: Up next, we’ll bring in our Sunday group to discuss President Trump's latest turn on the world stage, meeting with Vladimir Putin and other leaders.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): There is that position of the United States on the one hand, but I’m very happy that all other G-20 heads of state and governments have agreed that the Paris agreement is irreversible.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, host of the G-20 Summit, acknowledging there were some sharp differences between the U.S. and other countries.

And it’s time now for our Sunday group. Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume, columnist for The Hill, Juan Williams, former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards, and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, author of the best-selling book, ""Understanding Trump.""

Well, Speaker Gingrich, G19 was trending on Twitter this weekend because of the sharp differences between the president and all the other leaders, especially on climate change, but also as you heard my discussion with Reince Priebus on trade. Is that a good thing or a bad thing for the U.S.?

NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I think it's a good thing. Look, the president starts from a simple premise, we have a whole series of agreements that are bad for America, while they are good for the guys that got the deals. So, all these guys who got these good deals are going, oh gosh, you actually want to change the agreement?

Well, again, same thing with NATO, we went out and said to NATO, pay your fair share, including Germany, by the way, all of a sudden, they are shocked that we want to actually have them help defend themselves.

So, if you're going to go in and you are serious about changing the trade deals, the other side who have had a good, free ride are going to be mad at you. If you’re serious about changing the Paris accord on economic grounds, which is what Trump said, if you read his speech, it's very clear that he thinks this is a bad deal for America. Well, if you’re the Germans and the Chinese and the Indians, you think that's a great deal for you.

So, I think he did exactly what he promised to do. I think that's exactly what the campaign was about. If they think they can get along without the U.S. in the Paris accord, let's talk about six months from now because the truth is Angela Merkel and Germany ain't that big. Those people don't have -- they don’t have that much clout.

And in the end, remember, he starts the week by going to Warsaw, so between Theresa May in Britain and the Polish government in Warsaw, he’s also reminding the Europeans, the Europeans are split on a lot of issues, we don't happen to be with the chancellor on them.

WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, let me bring you in on this because while there certainly were differences and the European leaders aren't happy about this, and in many cases kind of said, it's one against 19, I’m sure there are a lot of Trump voters who would say playing nice with the world hasn't helped them, particularly in the case of jobs that they’ve lost.

FMR. REP. DONNA EDWARDS, D-MARYLAND: Well, I don’t think it’s a question of playing nice. It's a question of being a leader. And I think that one of the perceptions coming out of the G-20 is that the United States doesn't seem to be standing in its leadership position.

And so, you know, look, I was not a big fan of many of those trade deals. I think that it's really important for us to look at ways that we protect the American workers, that we strengthen our manufacturing for us. And so, I think it's appropriate to look at those things, but it doesn't mean leaving the rest of the world behind.

BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALSYT: It’s an interesting formulation here, and you're hearing it from Congresswoman Edwards and for many others as well, which is that the president is out of step with the leaders in Europe. In other words, if he refuses to follow them, he is therefore not leading.

To me, that just -- on logic grounds, that doesn't make any sense. He is taking a different path. There’s much -- there are many nations who will be with him. Certainly, the reception he got in Warsaw indicated that as well. And because he is out of step with a certain group of European leaders does not mean that he's given up a leadership role. It may indeed mean he's embracing it.

WALLACE: But let me ask you, Juan, and, you know, it’s a very interesting conversation I had with Reince Priebus on this question of steel imports. He basically says he's going to impose limits on steel and you get the head of the European Commission saying, god, we’ll then impose limits on some of your exports.

JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Right, so you get into a trade war situation. You see that inside the White House, you have people, like Steve Bannon saying, yes, this will appeal to our base, to people who feel like they've lost jobs because of these trade deals that are unfair to American workers, but you get ten people on the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn and others saying, you know what, we don't want a trade war, we don't need that kind of static right now, the economy seems to be going along pretty well, we had good numbers this week, why would you want to disrupt that?

And I think for a lot of people, this question then extends to the leadership issue you are hearing discussed here this morning.

So, my take on this is, when you talk about American leadership, you have to understand, we have the biggest economy in the world, we have the biggest military in the world, we can set an example for other countries. It may be that at some point, you say, hey, we are taking more aggressive steps that are being imposed on other countries, so that's not fair to us. But guess what? We are the big boy.

WALLACE: I want to turn to perhaps the highlight of the whole summit and that was the meeting, at least from the U.S. point of view, the meeting between President Trump and President Putin. Here’s the tone they set at the beginning of the meeting.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: We look forward to a lot of very positive things happening for Russia, for the United States, and for everybody concerned, and it's an honor to be with you.

VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I’m delighted to be able to meet you personally, Mr. President, and I hope as you have said, our meeting will yield positive results.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Speaker Gingrich, how much should we make of what the two men said about Russian meddling, now you’ve got President Trump in a tweet this morning saying I’m going to move forward, Syria, North Korea, all the issues? Are we overstating the importance of this meeting?

GINGRICH: Well, I think we’ll know in six or eight weeks. I mean, if they actually have a cease-fire that actually works, which also, by the way, involves Israel and Jordan, that's the first time in the Syrian civil war that we will have actually had a joint American-Russian agreement that survived. But I would say that you will know more about that in six to eight weeks.

If they create a relationship where they can get a genuine cease-fire in eastern Ukraine that is an enormous step in the right direction. If they can create a relationship with the Russians understand that we would defend the three Baltic States and that they cannot threaten them, that’s an enormous -- I mean --

WALLACE: Yes, there are a lot of ifs there.

GINGRICH: That's exactly right. I don’t -- given Putin's track record, I can’t sit here today and tell you this is a breakthrough. I can tell you that the tone is probably right. The fact that it lasted over two hours is probably right.

And that Putin is a very tough guy, but I think you may have been surprised by Tillerson and Trump because they’re very tough guys. And so, I think -- if you go back to some what I said, if you end up with two sets of tough guys and one of them has the largest economy, the largest military, the greatest reach in the world, probably that guy ends up winning if he is determined. And I think ultimately Putin is probably going to deal with Trump.

WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, you know, I want to ask about this controversy, and a lot of Democrats have been hitting Trump, a lot of your former colleagues in Congress, the idea of talking about moving forward. I mean, to some degree, do we want to hold the entire relationship hostage? Just assume the worst that the Russians meddled like crazy, tried everything they could to interfere in the election. Don’t we still have to do business with them?

EDWARDS: Well, I mean, there's moving forward and then there is, do we sanctions relief? And so --

WALLACE: Just want to talk with them (ph).

EDWARDS: So, I want to -- well, I want to hear what moving forward means because the fact is, the Trump administration actually has been engaged in the Congress trying to loosen the sanctions and are not happy with the bill that came out of the Senate. And so, I want to know what moving forward means. Does that mean that we do have to have a relationship at some level to try to deal with Syria? Yes, but our interests in Syria are very different from the Trump administration interest in Syria. We’re not going to prop up the Assad regime, I think Russia has that interest. And so --

HUME: Might I suggest that if the president had had a very tense meeting, centered entirely on the alleged meddling in the election, which appears clearly to have happened, and the meeting broke up in disagreement, with other issues on the backburner, that the president's critics would not have liked that better than what happened. This amounts to at least a renewal of diplomacy in an area where diplomacy has been at a chill for some time. We’ll see what comes of it. It's way too early to judge, as the speaker suggests, but I can't help and think that it's probably worth a try, at least, to see if diplomatically some things -- constructive things can be accomplished.

WALLACE: All right. We have to take a break here. We’ll see you all a little later.

Up next, the GOP's health care agenda is in trouble, but how much trouble? We’ll discuss the fate of repeal and replace with Republican senator and doctor, Bill Cassidy, who has his own plan.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Coming up, senators returned to Washington to tackle health care after some hear from voters back home.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Single payer.

UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Vote no! Vote no!

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Can the Senate pass repeal and replace? Republican senator and doctor, Bill Cassidy, joins us next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: A look outside the Beltway at New Orleans famed French quarter.

The Senate returns from recess tomorrow with Republicans still hoping to keep their promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare. But how realistic is that goal? Joining me now is Louisiana Senator and Dr. Bill Cassidy, who has his own health care plan.

Senator, welcome back.

SEN. BILL CASSIDY, R-LOUISIANA: Thank you.

You were one of the few Republican senators or congressmen to hold an open town hall during this last recess and you got an ear full on health care. Let's take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But I’ll tell you what’s rude, taking 22 million people off their health care in this country who you know who cannot afford it.

You worked at the Earl K. Long Hospital for a long time and you know what people are like at their lowest. So to step on their necks by kicking them off their health care at this point, that’s cruel, sir.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: A strong message to follow.

As you went around the state of Louisiana these last ten days, how concerned are voters? How concerned are folks when they read -- and obviously this fellow was aware of it, the CBO report that -- that tens of millions of people could lose their health insurance under the plans Republicans are putting forward?

CASSIDY: They’re very concerned. You're hearing two different arguments. You’re hearing first folks saying, listen, I'm paying $1,700 a month for insurance. Before ObamaCare I was paying $800. And I have $6,000 deductibles per family member. And are (ph) you have folks who -- with disabilities who are concerned they will lose their coverage for the disability. That shows that health care is like no other issue, it touches people in their most personal being. We’ve got to get it right.

WALLACE: And they’re not happy with the current situation.

CASSIDY: Well, people don't like change even from worst to better. And there’s been a lot of kind of promulgation of things which are not true about the health care bills that are going up. By the way, I have reservations about the Senate bill. But, nonetheless, some of that which is of concern does not need to be a concern.

WALLACE: Well, let's talk about the plan, because you and Senator Collins, Republican Senator Collins of Maine, who has said at this point that she's against the bill, the -- the Senate bill, with the -- your plan that you’re putting forward, here are some of the highlights, keep most ObamaCare taxes to pay for a replacement, allow states to keep most of ObamaCare if they want, for states that want a new system, auto enroll people in insurance so thy have to opt out, not opt in.

Senator, it’s an interesting plan, but how many of your colleagues in the Senate, and particularly Republicans, have signed on to it?

CASSIDY: We have six of us total, more than any other plan out there. And, by the way, I would say that is the only way we can go forward.

WALLACE: But -- but you -- you need 50, plus the vice president.

CASSIDY: Oh, we need -- I totally get that. But once -- if -- if the president logs in that this is the plain he wishes, or that the leadership says, OK, this is the plan we want, then it will be the plan that goes forward. Some people were going to sign on. They said, let's see what President Trump does.

Let's first talk, Chris, though, about why they’ve had such a problem passing any plan. They're trying to combine tax reform with health care reform. We take care of that. We say, let's do health care reform first and then address the tax situation when you do comprehensive tax reconciliation -- comprehensive tax reform. Don't mix the two. We don't mix the two.

Secondly, are we serious about keeping Donald Trump’s campaign pledges to cover all, care for pre-existing conditions, eliminate the individual and employer mandate and lower premiums. If we’re serious about that, Cassidy-Collins is the only way to get there.

WALLACE: But -- but here's the criticism that -- that you here. And, quite frankly, I don't mean to be negative, but this is the reason it doesn't seem like Cassidy-Collins is going anywhere, is that if New York -- what you’re basically saying is it’s a federal system. Each state can decide what fits them. That is a good, conservative, federal argument. But if New York and if California decide that they’re going to retain ObamaCare with all of the benefits, most of ObamaCare, with federal taxes, which is what your plan would do, conservative senators say in their states what you’re going to do away with ObamaCare, then the folks in their states are playing so New Yorkers can have bigger, better, richer health care coverage than they can.

CASSIDY: That is a misunderstanding of our bill. Every state gets an equivalent amount of money based upon their population and a couple other factors, cost of care, et cetera. So every state would get their fair share, if you will. New York and California would continue to get the share they want, minus, by the way, the penalties on the individual and employer mandates. We repeal those mandates. So those states would have to re-impose individual and employer mandates. Frankly, I don’t think they keep ObamaCare. I think they go with our other option.

WALLACE: All right, the hot idea right now is Ted Cruz's plan, that he is offering under which each exchange, an insurer would -- could offer what are called skinny plans, cheaper plans with fewer benefits that people could buy but as long as they offer one plan that has all the benefits under ObamaCare. And the argument against that is that you’re going to get healthy people, they’re going to buy the cheaper plan with less coverage because they’re healthy, and that means that the middle income people, who aren't covered by Medicaid, who have pre-existing conditions or serious problems are going to have these expensive comprehensive plans they won’t be able to afford. You basically have a two class insurance system and for the people who really need it no insurance at all.

CASSIDY: Well, first, I’m all for -- I’m all for people being able to choose the insurance plan that best suits their needs. We should absolutely do that. But you’re right, if you (INAUDIBLE) off the older and sicker in their own plan with their own risk pool, then you’ve just re-created the ObamaCare exchanges with federal taxpayers putting billions in to subsidize the expense of a few. We need to have a common risk pool where everybody chips in a little bit for that young person who gets in a car wreck, for example. If we do it, and in that case the Cruz amendment’s a good amendment.

WALLACE: But, as it now stands, Cruz is a nonstarter for you?

CASSIDY: I don’t know the amendment. If it turns out it's two plans --

WALLACE: Well, that's what he's described.

CASSIDY: With -- no, that's OK. With two risk pools, then that's bad because --

WALLACE: That's what he’s described.

CASSIDY: No. He has not yet designated whether or not you have a single risk pool or two risk pools. If it is a single risk pool, that actually works. If it is two risk pools, that’s just ObamaCare recreated and we need to do something different than ObamaCare.

WALLACE: At least 10 Republican senators have now said -- have come out formally -- you have not, although you’ve expressed doubts about it -- have expressed doubts about the McConnell plan as it was offered the last week in June. Is that plan now dead?

CASSIDY: We don't know what the plan is.

WALLACE: Well, wait a minute, it was -- it was submitted.

CASSIDY: Well, the draft plan has now been serious rewrite. And so we don't know what the serious rewrite -- clearly the draft plan is dead. Is the serious rewrite plan dead? I don't know. I’ve not seen the serious rewrite plan.

WALLACE: It’s -- it -- it's a heck of a way to do business.

CASSIDY: It is a heck of a way to do business. By the way, I go back to Cassidy-Collins. The nice thing about Cassidy-Collins --

WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE).

CASSIDY: The nice thing about Cassidy-Collins, as you said, it’s a conservative, federalist approach which actually gives the state guidelines, gives every state their fair share and allows them to come up with the answer for their state. It actually takes that decision-making away from us, returning it to the patients and the state. That's where we should be.

WALLACE: And then there is the idea that President Trump offered in a tweet a few days ago, and let's put this up on the screen, ""if Republican senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately repeal and then replace at a later date."" What you think of that?

CASSIDY: A nonstarter. I’ll tell you, there will be uncertainty in the insurance markets. Premiums will rise for middle-class families. It gives all the power to people who actually don't believe in President Trump’s campaign pledges, who actually don't want to continue to cover and care for pre-existing conditions and to lower premiums. It gives them the stronger hand. I think it's wrong. I think it betrays President Trump’s campaign pledges.

WALLACE: So I come away from this, senator, thinking that -- that repeal and replace is in real trouble.

CASSIDY: In the current pathway, it has been. And I know I sound like a broken record. We should go back to conservative principles where we devolve power to the states and to the patients allowing them to make the patients -- the best decision for them.

WALLACE: But I guess what I'm asking is, if you look at a rewritten -- and I understand you haven't seen it all -- but what you've heard about. I mean there's nobody who’s more clued in on this than you are in the Senate. If you look at what McConnell is talking about, you look at what Cruz is talking about, forget Kennedy -- Cassidy-Collins for a moment. How much trouble is repeal and replace in?

CASSIDY: If you're only talking about the draft plan, clearly it’s not going to pass. Ten senators have said they would not vote for it. On the other hand, every time they come up with an iteration that becomes more conservative in the sense of giving power back to states, we move a little bit closer to passage. So if we continue in that pathway, I do think we come up with both a bill that passes and one that fulfills President Trump’s campaign pledges.

WALLACE: Does this get passed by the end of the month?

CASSIDY: I don’t know that.

WALLACE: Do you -- you want to put odds on it?

CASSIDY: I would probably put that as 50/50. I do think we have to do something for market stabilization, otherwise people who are paying premiums of $20,000 $30,000 and $40,000 will pay even that much more. So we have to do something to stabilize the market for those middle-class families currently kind of groaning beneath ObamaCare.

But, going forward, ObamaCare just cannot -- our American people want more freedom to make the decision that matters to them and not have somebody in Washington, D.C., tell them what that decision should be. ObamaCare tells them what that decision should be. It may take a while, but we will get to a point where that power goes back to the family. And that's where it should be.

WALLACE: But it might not happen on this legislative calendar.

CASSIDY: It may not happen completely on this legislative calendar, but the process will begin. And as that process begins, it will be inevitable that it will eventually, completely occur.

WALLACE: Senator Cassidy, thank you. Thanks for coming in. It's always good to talk with you, sir.

CASSIDY: Thank you, Chris.

WALLACE: Up next, we’ll bring back our Sunday group to handicap whether Mitch McConnell can put together the 50 votes he needs to pass a bill.

Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about GOP chances for repeal and replace? Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @foxnewssunday, and we may use your question on the air.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: ObamaCare is in a total death spiral. And the problems will only get worse if Congress fails to act. ObamaCare is dead.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: President Trump making his central argument, that Republicans have no choice but to repeal and replace a plan that is now falling apart.

And we’re back now with the panel.

So, Brit, Mitch McConnell didn't want his GOP colleagues to go home for this recess, concerned that spending a lot of time with their voters at home would only weaken support, not strengthen support, for repeal and replace. How much trouble are Republicans in now in passing a bill?

HUME: Well, I think the bill’s in trouble and it will have to be revised. And whether it can be revised to the point where it can gather a majority in the Senate is a question. And what is really troubling about this, Chris, is this, that at the heart of these repeal and replace efforts is the -- is the reform of Medicaid, not to cut its spending, but to reduce the spiraling rate of growth of that program. If the Republicans, with control both houses and the White House, cannot do this on this matter, it signals that entitlement (ph) reform, which for budgetary and physical reasons and for the national economy needs to happen, cannot happen. And that, in my mind, is alarming, disturbing and very worrisome.

WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel. And on this question of whether or not the Senate is going to be able -- Republicans in the Senate -- to repeal and replace ObamaCare, we got this on Twitter from Ron Powell who writes, ""why, if they had eight years and multiple House votes to repeal did you not have an alternative ready when you took power? It’s clear they had zero.""

Speaker Gingrich, how do you answer Ron?

GINGRICH: Well, they -- they did have a plan and I think what they've learned, painfully, is that the kind of plan you have when everybody assumes it will get vetoed gets one level of scrutiny. The kind of plan you have when everybody thinks it’s going to become law, the -- it skyrockets. So they found it to be much harder than they thought it would be. My personal bet would be that McConnell will find the votes and I think it's possible, if they get a package that can actually run from the most conservative member to the most moderate member in the Senate, that that will just be passed by the House without a conference.

I think people really want to get this done and I think McConnell -- I think -- again, you had a -- I think just now a senator who really understands this issue and who I think was able to outline, as a medical doctor, the right direction. They’re going to keep churning for another two weeks. The deadline is good for them. The Senate tends to operate best when it's faced with a really big deadline. And I think they’ll get something done before the August break.

WALLACE: But what about Brit’s question, because that is one of the big concerns, and that President Obama and the Democrats expanded Medicaid, covered people that weren't previously covered, millions of people got it under there. This -- while it is true that -- that it doesn't cut Medicaid, it slows the rate of growth of Medicaid, some people who now have coverage eventually would lose coverage, and it states that didn't expand Medicaid, there’s a tremendous concern that they’re going to be stuck in an inferior position. How do you make them whole? Both -- both sides.

GINGRICH: Well, first of all -- first of all, I’m underwhelmed by governors who love free money. You have a lot of governors who say, oh, we want more of this money. Ninety percent of the cost to be picked up by the feds for the expanded part of Medicaid, which, by the way, actually discriminates against, for example, Americans with disabilities because they only get 62 percent of federal funding. And some states have actually re-rigged the game to get more able-bodied adults.

Second, I would say, look at what Mary Mayhew (ph) did in Maine where they passed reforms that said, if you’re an able-bodied adult, than you ought to be required to work if you have no children. Medicaid has expanded dramatically in the zones it was never designed for and I think the American people would support reforms that had work requirements attached to people who were able-bodied adults.

WALLACE: Juan, what do you think are the chances that Republicans fail to pass anything on repeal and replace, which I think there's a growing sentiment here in Washington. And if they fail to pass it after seven years of promising they would, what's the backlash they’ll face in 2018?

WILLIAMS: Well, I think their -- by the way, the premise of your question is right on target because at this point it looks to me like really what the Republicans are up against his embarrassment with the Republican base that they are not in position to pass repeal and replace after so many years, so much rhetoric and votes to undo ObamaCare and you have conservative lobbying groups here in town who are pressing hard, incising that they must repeal and replace or they will pay a price in 2018 in the midterms.

But the fact is that ultimately Mitch McConnell has expressed doubts about having it. President Trump -- the votes to pass it. President Trump has said the House bill is mean, Chris. Mean. And so what you have is the question of how the base reacts. And at this point I think the base, and a polarized electorate, is not going to abandon Republicans if they fail to repeal and replace. They’re not going to go vote for the Democrats. The problem is a political one because at this point we’re not talking about a good plan. Nobody on the -- even Republicans, when they’re polled, don't think this is a good plan for them. It's what you saw in the town hall meeting.

So, you don't have repeal and replace. Nobody’s building a border wall. No tax cuts. No tax reform. Dreamers still here. You’ve got to think, hey, Republicans, did you buy a bill of goods or what?

WALLACE: I think folks would just go home, put the -- put the blanket over their head and go back to sleep.

Congresswoman Edwards, President Trump, in that opening clip we played, may be overstating it, but you’ve got to agree that ObamaCare, as it currently stands, is in trouble. Premiums are going up. Deductibles are going up. And let me put this on the screen. In 2016, 85 percent of enrollees had a choice of three or more insurers. This year, only 58 percent of enrollees have a choice of three or more insurers. And just to take away one of your arguments, a lot of this started before President Trump became president.

EDWARDS: Well, I also think that, you know, first of all, the rate of increase is not the rate of increase that we would have seen had we done nothing at all. That is really clear. Medical costs were skyrocketing. And so I think that now, you know, the Trump administration has done some things to really destabilize the system and I think insurers --

WALLACE: But -- but in fairness, this is the point I was trying to take away from you is --

EDWARDS: Wait, insurers -- I know. But, no, no, no, but --

WALLACE: A lot of it was already in trouble.

EDWARDS: But let me just say this. I mean over this last year we have heard message after message about the need to repeal and replace and it has created total instability in the system. And I think insurers rightly don't know what's going on. And so we know that there are things that can be done to strengthen the Affordable Care Act that Republicans and Democrats can agree on, things like removing the excise tax, making sure that we provide greater incentives for young people to be in the system so that we have a greater pool. And so there are any number of things that can be done on a bipartisan basis and that's where I’d like to see this go, making sure that people like me with pre-existing conditions are able to get affordable health care the end of the day.

WALLACE: You’ve got 20 seconds.

HUME: Republicans face the problem of -- of doing nothing and seeing this collapse. Make no mistake about it, Chris, they will be blamed. They control everything. If it -- if it collapses and people are worse off, that’s as big a problem -- a bigger -- is at least as big a problem as -- as whatever they pass.

WALLACE: And it was meaningful, I thought, that Mitch McConnell said, if we can't pass repeal and replace, we’re going to have to work with Democrats to try and fix it.

Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.

Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week."" One of America’s greatest dancers retires and brings her next act to Washington.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: It happens to all of us, that point in your career when it's time to move on. As we told you last fall, one of America’s most celebrated dancers is now on to her next chapter and she's our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JULIE KENT, THE WASHINGTON BALLET: Leaving the stage was traumatic, heartbreaking. One of the most difficult, wonderful things I’ve experienced in my life.

WALLACE (voice-over): Julie Kent is talking about the moment in 2015 when she decided to retire after 30 years as a star of the American Ballet Theater. At age 45, she could feel her skills declining, and there was another sign.

KENT: At the end of the day when Derek Jeter retired, I guess I figured I had to go, too. And Mariano (ph).

WALLACE (on camera): Yes. It’s true!

KENT: They were my guys. So, if they’re not going to play, I guess I can’t either.

WALLACE (voice-over): The question was, what to do next. The Washington Ballet asked her to become its artistic director.

KENT: As I said to some of the dancers, the next best thing to creating beautiful art is watching it.

WALLACE: And so Kent now spends hours in the studios helping dancers realize their dreams just as she did.

KENT: Its home. It’s just -- it’s at home. The bar, the mirror, the floors, the smell, the piano, the ambiance. To me it's just home.

WALLACE: Kent wants to expand the company and its repertoire of ballets.

KENT: My goals are to take this company to a place where it hasn't been before.

WALLACE: Part of her job is also to oversee The Washington School of Ballet, which has more than 1,000 students.

WALLACE (on camera): Is that a concern of yours, that being such a great dancer yourself, you -- that may not translate into being a great teacher?

KENT: I always say to them, I -- I -- I don't want you to do what you think I would do, because I’d really rather do it myself. I want to see what you are going to do.

I have no memories in life before dance.

WALLACE (voice-over): Kent started dancing as a child. At age ten, her first professional performance was alongside a master.

KENT: To be this close, sharing a wing with Baryshnikov, it was incredible.

WALLACE: She would go on to be one of the most celebrated dancers of her generation.

WALLACE (on camera): How is it to be a prima ballerina? Fun, glamorous, or just hard work?

KENT: It's the whole -- it’s everything.

WALLACE (voice-over): While she’s now retired, she doesn't close the door entirely on a possible encore.

WALLACE (on camera): Are you going to perform with the company?

KENT: That's not on the plan. No. If it made sense for me to perform, then I’m a very logical person as far as message. And if it makes sense, then it makes sense.

WALLACE (voice-over): But Julie Kent understands, after 30 years in the spotlight, she has taken on a new role.

KENT: I loved it. I still love it. I would still do it if I felt like it was the right thing to be doing. But you have to give the light to the next generation.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: Kent is busy this summer preparing for her second season with the company. But, no, she has yet to return to the stage herself.

That's it for today. Have a great week. We’ll see you next ""Fox News Sunday.""

Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner’s attorney confirmed the June 2016 meeting of the men and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower. Then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort also attended, according to the statement from Donald Trump Jr.

“It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow-up,” said Donald Trump Jr. in a statement released to Fox News. “I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.”

Trump Jr. does not serve in the administration and is not required to disclose his foreign contacts.

Kushner lawyer Jamie Gorelick, told Fox News in a statement: “As we have previously stated, Mr. Kushner’s SF-86 was prematurely submitted and, among other errors, did not list any contacts with foreign government officials. The next day, Mr. Kushner submitted supplemental information stating that he had had ‘numerous contacts with foreign officials’ about which he would be happy to provide additional information.""

""He has since submitted this information, including that during the campaign and transition, he had over 100 calls or meetings with representatives of more than 20 countries, most of which were during transition,"" said Gorelick. ""Mr. Kushner has submitted additional updates and included, out of an abundance of caution, this meeting with a Russian person, which he briefly attended at the request of his brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr. As Mr. Kushner has consistently stated, he is eager to cooperate and share what he knows.”

Manafort helmed Trump’s campaign for about five months until August and resigned from the campaign immediately after the Associated Press reported on his firm’s covert Washington lobbying operation on behalf of Ukraine’s ruling political party. He is one of several people linked to President Trump who are under scrutiny by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and congressional committees investigating Russian attacks on the U.S. during the 2016 campaign and potential collusion with Trump associates.

Manafort has denied any coordination with Russia and has said his work in Ukraine was not related to the campaign.

Follow Her On Twitter At']",FOX News,"The company behind an infamous anti-Trump dossier also worked ""on behalf of the Russian government"" to fight U.S. sanctions that had enraged Moscow's elite, a key witness testified to a Senate committee on Thursday.

The testimony of Bill Browder, the CEO and co-founder of Hermitage Capital, shed new light on the dealings of the controversial company Fusion GPS -- which was tied to the dossier of spurious claims about President Trump. According to Browder, the company also conducted a ""smear campaign"" against him in a bid to fight Russia sanctions.

Further adding to the complexity, Browder also testified that this campaign was orchestrated by Natalia Veselnitskaya – the same Russian attorney who sought the highly scrutinized Trump Tower meeting last June with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

""They were talking about a repeal of sanctions so that Russian torturers and murderers could keep their money in America,"" he testified.

The dramatic testimony had been blocked a day earlier by Senate Democrats, as part of delay tactics executed in protest of ObamaCare repeal efforts.

But Browder's comments could raise problems for both pro- and anti-Trump camps.

On one hand, his written testimony detailed how the Russian lawyer with whom Trump's eldest son met was involved with the same company linked to the shady dossier smearing the now-president. Trump Jr. already has faced intense bipartisan criticism for taking that meeting, apparently after being told the lawyer had dirt on Hillary Clinton

But more broadly, Browder's testimony skewered the Fusion firm itself, along with co-founder Glenn Simpson.

He said the Russian lawyer, working through an intermediary, hired Simpson to ""conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of a congressional hearing on the Global Magnitsky Act.""

RUSSIA PROBE: DEMOCRATS BLOCK KEY WITNESS AGAINST SHADOWY FIRM FUSION GPS

Browder had hired the late Sergei Magnitsky to uncover details of massive financial fraud in Russia involving corrupt Russian government officials. Magnitsky was imprisoned and ultimately beaten to death by Russian officers in Moscow. In the wake of his death, the U.S. passed a law in his name that brought sanctions against Russian oligarchs suspected of money laundering.

Browder described the tactics Simpson allegedly used to discredit him and Magnitsky.

“Glenn Simpson was pitching a story to journalists that Magnitsky had not been murdered, but died of natural causes; that he wasn’t a whistleblower, but a criminal, and that the story I told Congress was incorrect,” Browder said Thursday, adding they were “unsuccessful for the most part” in getting that story written.

Left unclear in Thursday's hearing was what connection there might have been between the Russians and the anti-Trump dossier commissioned by Fusion GPS.

Browder was questioned by multiple senators Thursday on that issue -- but said he was a “bystander” in regard to the dossier and the crude allegations against Trump, as he had only read reports in the press.

“What I’m familiar with is Fusion GPS and Glenn Simpson’s role working on behalf of the Russian government to overturn the Magnitsky Act,” Browder said. “The steps they took there compromised their integrity.”

Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., originally had wanted to hear testimony this week from Simpson as well as Trump Jr. and Manafort. All three witnesses have since reached arrangements to interview with the committee, for now, in private.

A human rights advocate with the Human Rights Foundation, Thor Halvorssen, also submitted documents for the record with regard to Fusion GPS, though he did not appear at the hearing. He told Fox News the company is notorious for running smear campaigns in return for “large enough retainers.”

“It’s the sort of thing they specialize in—mainstreaming false smears, allegations that are so salacious and over the top that people assume they must be true,” Halvorssen told Fox News.

Browder’s testimony was rich with knowledge of the Russian government and corruption within, giving details of Veselnitskaya’s relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other officials.

Browder said that Veselnitskaya had worked for the FSB, which is a successor to the KGB.

MYSTERY SOLVED? TIMELINE SHOWS HOW RUSSIAN LAWYER GOT INTO US FOR TRUMP JR. MEETING

“There is no such thing as a former KGB agent,” Browder said, adding that there was also “no such thing” as a former intelligence officer, mentioning Rinat Akhmetshin who attended the Trump Tower meeting with Veselnitskaya. “It’s like Hotel California—you can check out any time you like, but never leave.”

Later Thursday, Fusion GPS responded to the allegations raised in the hearing.

“Fusion GPS has complied with the law. It is a matter of public record that Fusion GPS worked for and under the supervision of an American law firm to provide support for civil litigation in New York. It was not required to register under FARA, and it did not spread false information about William Browder or Sergei Magnitsky,"" the company said in a statement to Fox News. “What is clear is that the president and his allies are desperately trying to smear Fusion GPS because it investigated Donald Trump's ties to Russia. They have pulled out all the stops, including this false allegation about FARA.""

The statement said: ""At today’s hearing, not even Mr. Browder could understand or adopt the Republicans' nonsensical argument that Russia had an agent investigate and expose the Russians’ influence on the election. Fusion GPS is cooperating with Congress and looks forward to sharing the truth.”

The June 9, 2016 meeting was billed to the Trump campaign as one to discuss Russian adoption and potentially get dirt on Clinton, but Browder said adoption was “code” for talking about the Magnitsky Act.

EIGHTH PARTICIPANT IN TRUMP TOWER MEETING IDENTIFIED

“Go and ask the possible future president of the United States to repeal a major piece of human rights legislation. What were they willing to offer in return? I don’t know. And whether that offer made sense to the other side, I don’t know,” he said.

But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., seemingly defended the Trump campaign saying, “I don’t think that in June 2016 they knew adoption meant Magnitsky Act.” Graham asked Browder about the Russian tactics and their ability to “play both sides against the middle.”

“I am not certain that they wouldn’t have made the same attempt with the Democratic candidate if there was any opening, or receptivity there—they are nonpartisan,” Browder said. “The Russians would try to bribe and blackmail anybody.”

Follow Her On Twitter At']",FOX News,"The White House went on offense Wednesday amid the firestorm over Donald Trump Jr.’s campaign-season meeting with a Russian lawyer, trying to turn the tables by alleging the Democratic National Committee and the Clintons are the ones caught up in “collusion.""

The White House has been grappling all week with revelations of a meeting the president’s eldest son held last year with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, who was said to have dirt on Hillary Clinton as part of a Russian government effort to help the Trump campaign.

But Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders used Wednesday’s off-camera briefing to highlight DNC and Clinton ties to foreign governments including Russia and Ukraine.

“If we’re looking at Russia relationships with anybody, it would be directly with the Clintons,” she said, citing examples of a speech former President Bill Clinton gave in Russia for which he reportedly earned over $500,000 and reports of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton selling what Sanders described as “a third of the world’s uranium” to Russia.

Putting more distance between himself and Russia, even on the heels of a meeting with Vladimir Putin, President Trump also said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network set to air Thursday that he believes there are “many reasons” Putin would prefer Hillary Clinton in office over him.

“We are the most powerful country in the world and we are getting more and more powerful because I’m a big military person. As an example, if Hillary had won, our military would be decimated. Our energy would be much more expensive. That’s what Putin doesn’t like about me. And that’s why I say why would he want me?” Trump said.

Meanwhile, Sanders drew attention Wednesday to other alleged examples of Democratic coordination with a foreign government.

“If there’s been any evidence of collusion in 2016 actually happening, it would have been between the DNC and the Ukrainian government,” Sanders said.

Sanders was referring to a Politico report published in January. The report cited a meeting between Ukrainian government officials who allegedly tried to help Clinton undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office and shared research and damaging information on Trump and his advisers with Clinton allies.

TRUMP UNLOADS ON HILLARY OVER DOUBLE STANDARD, AMID REPORTS DEMS ALSO GOT FOREIGN HELP

The Politico investigation exposed that a Ukrainian-American DNC operative –Alexandra Chalupa, who worked in the Clinton White House—met with officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump’s then-top campaign official Paul Manafort and Russia. Manafort later resigned.

In Wednesday’s briefing, Sanders was effectively picking up where Trump left off on Twitter.

On Wednesday morning, Trump took to Twitter to rip Clinton over what he described as a double standard for their respective associates’ alleged cooperation with foreign governments in the 2016 campaign.

Trump first drew attention to a Washington Times article claiming Democrats had used false information from Russia to attack him and his campaign.

“@WashTimes states ‘Democrats have willfully used Moscow disinformation to influence the presidential election against Donald Trump,” the president tweeted.

He added, “Why aren’t the same standards placed on the Democrats. Look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with. Disgraceful!”

The news report refers back to the questionable dossier—written by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele and allegedly distributed by Fusion GPS—which contained unverified allegations against the Trump team. Fusion GPS, the Democrat-funded opposition research firm, allegedly paid Steele with money from a Clinton backer. The dossier eventually fell into the hands of the FBI.

As Sanders referenced such reports at Wednesday’s briefing, she said: “This is the only collusion I’ve seen, and it’s certainly been proven.”

Even as the White House sought to shift the focus to Democrats, the Trump team is facing mounting bipartisan scrutiny over both the Trump Jr. meeting and the administration’s handling of the latest revelations.

TRUMP DEFENDS SON AS 'HIGH-QUALITY PERSON,' AS RUSSIA MEETING EMAILS FUEL CRITICISM

Sanders told reporters on Wednesday that she was “not aware of” any additional meetings with Trump officials and Russian nationals.

“Our goal is to be as transparent as humanly possible and put every bit of information at the forefront,” Sanders said. “We are willing to cooperate with anybody looking into this matter.”

Sanders was asked to respond to criticism from House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who told Fox News Tuesday night that the “drip, drip, drip is undermining the credibility of this administration.”

“I think it’s actually undermining the credibility of the media because they drip, drip, drip, without having much to do about anything,” Sanders said.

Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary and now Fox News contributor, said that the White House’s handling of the Donald Trump Jr. situation has been “terrible.”

“The White House created a four day drip, drip, drip, drop instead of getting it all out of the way on the first day,” Fleischer told Fox News, but said the White House should “make the case” questioning where the coverage was of the Ukrainian meeting between officials and an ex-Clinton staffer. “Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting was bad judgment. This is not excusing what he did—but it’s disproportionate. It’s part of why Donald Trump feels the press is unfair to him, and with some justification.”"

“She shouldn’t have been in the country,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told ""Fox & Friends"" on Wednesday.

The senior lawmaker is raising questions about how Natalia Veselnitskaya was able to gain access to the U.S. for a June 9 meeting with Trump Jr., then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and senior aide and President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

The brief session was set up by publicist Rob Goldstone, who promised “information that would incriminate Hillary” Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate. Goldstone had said the dirt was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump” -- a detail that has fueled Trump critics' claims of collusion with Moscow last year, though the lawyer apparently did not have such damaging information.

Asked Wednesday if the meeting may have been a setup by opponents of Trump – perhaps even then-President Barack Obama – Grassley demurred.

“There’s no way I know that and I shouldn’t comment on things you don’t know,” he said.

The Russian lawyer would have been granted entry under the Obama administration, and Grassley said he's sent inquiries to the relevant agencies.

“I think the lady Russian lawyer that was there in that meeting, I’ve written to [The State Department and Department of Homeland Security] to find out what she was doing in the country when presumably either her visa or parole expired,” Grassley said on “Fox & Friends.”

Grassley wrote the departments saying Veselnitskaya had been granted parole to enter the U.S. sometime in 2015, but her parole expired in January 2016, months before the Trump Jr. meeting. Grassley noted on “Fox & Friends” that Veselnitskaya’s movements – approved or otherwise – in the U.S. occurred during the Obama administration’s watch.

“And if there’d been enforcement of the immigration laws she wouldn’t have been in the country,” he said. “The other thing, if she was representing a foreign government…she wasn’t registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act as well.”

He added, “We do have a responsibility to congressional oversight to get to the bottom of it.”"

AP Stylebook Instructs Writers Not to Use Words Like 'Pro-Life,' 'Refugee' & 'Terrorist'

Former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer reacted to the newest reporting on Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer last June.

Earlier today, Trump Jr. released an email chain in which he set up the meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya after being told of incriminating information on Hillary Clinton.

The emails - purported to be between Trump Jr. and publicist Rob Goldstone - described Veselnitskaya as a ""Russian government attorney.""

Trump Jr. wrote back at one point, ""if it's what you say I love it"" on possibly obtaining damaging information that would help the Trump campaign.

Fleischer said on ""Outnumbered"" today that accepting the meeting appears to be ""bad judgment"" by Trump, rather than a crime or evidence of collusion.

""It certainly seems to me to be opposition research,"" he explained, adding this is not evidence of earlier allegations that the Trump team worked with Russia on the stolen DNC emails.

He said the White House has badly managed the matter, since there is a continuous 'drip, drip"" of new reports on contacts between the Trump team and Russia.

Fleischer, a new Fox News contributor, said seasoned political professionals would probably have known to ignore the offer, but the Trump campaign may have been ignorant.

""You just don't cross certain lines. ... Yes, you want opposition [research] on your opponent, but not the from the Russian government,"" he said.

Meghan McCain emphasized that the Trump administration will be dogged by a line in the email which described the information as ""high-level and sensitive"" and a part of the Russian government's support of Trump.

She said former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort should be blamed for this situation, calling him ""incompetent"" and ""one of the worst people who work in politics.""

McCain said a past statement by Vice President Mike Pence, in which he denied contacts between the Trump team and Russians, ""is now a lie.""

""How they have let this spin so completely out of control is beyond my comprehension,"" she concluded.

Follow Her On Twitter']",FOX News,"When Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer as his father campaigned for the presidency, he thought she had information about the elder Donald Trump’s political opponent. Instead, she just wanted to talk about the Magnitsky Act, Trump Jr. said.

The president's oldest son has denied that the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, divulged any information about Clinton during their 2016 meeting. She did, however, want to discuss the Russian adoption ban and the Magnitsky Act – enacted by the Obama administration in 2012.

Read on for a look at the little-known law and how it came to be.

Who was Sergei Magnitsky?

Sergei Magnitsky was a Russian lawyer hired by Hermitage Capital, a London-based hedge fund, when he accused Russian officials of a $230 million tax fraud scheme involving tax rebates.

After Magnitsky turned over evidence of the crime to police, he was arrested – first for allegedly helping Hermitage Capital underpay taxes, and later for masterminding the fraud he uncovered, the Washington Post reported in 2012.

DONALD TRUMP JR.'S MEETING WITH RUSSIAN LAWYER: WHAT TO KNOW

Magnitsky was arrested in November 2008 and died in prison in November 2009. The official cause of death was a heart attack, but independent investigators said Magnitsky was tortured and denied medical treatment.

So what does the Magnitsky Act do?

Officially called the “Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012,” the law enacts sanctions on certain Russian officials as a punishment for human rights violations.

Adopted in 2012, the Magnitsky Act permitted the U.S. to freeze financial assets of Russian officials who contributed to the abuse, arrest and death of Magnitsky. It was later expanded in 2016 to include human rights abusers anywhere.

DONALD TRUMP JR. RELEASES 'ENTIRE EMAIL CHAIN' REGARDING RUSSIAN MEETING

Americans are prohibited from doing any business with these individuals. Any assets they may have in the U.S. are frozen.

What was Russia's response?

In response to the law, Russia decided to prohibit American adoption of Russian orphans.

The Dima Yakovlev Law – named for a Russian child who died of heat stroke in Virginia in 2008 after being left in a hot car for nine hours – could be lifted, USA Today reported in January.

TRUMP TWEETS DEFENSE OF DONALD TRUMP JR., BLASTS 'FAKE MEDIA'

“Everything can be changed back,” Valentina Matvienko, the speaker of Russia’s house of parliament said. But she added that “at least some steps from the U.S. are needed” before the law could be overturned.

How is Natalia Veselnitskaya involved with this law?

Veselnitskaya opposes the Magnitsky sanctions. She has represented Denis Katsyv, the son of a top executive in state-owned Russian Railways. He was charged in the U.S. with money laundering after investigators suspected his company bought ritzy New York real estate using proceeds from the $230 million tax fraud scheme that Magnitsky exposed.

While Veselnitskaya was supposed to have information on Clinton, she actually wanted to discuss the Magnitsky Act and the Russian adoption ban, Trump Jr. said. He added that he told her the conversation should wait until “if and when [his father] held public office.”

At a joint press conference with the French president in Paris, Trump said the media are making ""a very big deal over something that really a lot of people would do.”

He then turned his focus to Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch, saying he had “heard” Lynch was the one to approve Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya’s visa.

This is an apparent reference to reports that Lynch signed off on granting the attorney special ""parole"" to be in the country -- though it remains unclear whether she had permission to be in the U.S. at the time of the June 2016 meeting.

""Somebody said that her visa or her passport to come into the country was approved by Attorney General Lynch, now maybe that’s wrong, I just heard that a little while ago … [that] she was here because of Lynch.""

Trump also, as he has in recent days, defended Donald Trump Jr. against criticism.

""My son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer but a Russian lawyer,"" Trump said in the press conference with President Emmanuel Macron. ""From a practical standpoint most people would have taken that meeting, it's called opposition research or research into your opponent.""

On Capitol Hill, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee says he will call on Trump Jr. to testify amid investigations into Russian meddling in last year's election.

Grassley said he wants Trump Jr. to testify ""pretty soon,"" and it could be as early as next week. Asked if he was willing to issue a subpoena if Trump Jr. declined to appear, Grassley said ""yes.""

Back in Paris, Trump and Macron set aside lingering differences on climate change during their meeting, with both saying the disagreement shouldn’t prevent them from working together toward a post-war roadmap for Syria.

When pressed by a reporter on America’s participation in a future global agreement on climate after the U.S. moved to withdraw from the Paris pact, Trump remained non-committal.

Trump Jr. said he was asked by an acquaintance to meet with the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, who was described to him as somebody who “might have information helpful to the campaign.”

The president's eldest son also said that Veselnitskaya claimed to know about ""individuals connected to Russia [who] were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton.""

Trump Jr. said he ended the meeting after about 25 minutes, upon concluding that Veselnitskaya's statements were ""vague, ambiguous and made no sense.""

""It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information,"" he said.

The Times story is a follow-up to an initial report about the meeting that was posted online Saturday. The report states the meeting “points to the central question in federal investigations” about whether the Kremlin meddled in the 2016 presidential election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russian officials.

“The accounts of the meeting represent the first public indication that at least some in the campaign were willing to accept Russian help,” Sunday's report states.

The Times reported that Trump Jr. was initally asked about the Veselnitskaya meeting on Saturday and said only that it was primarily about allowing Americans to adopt Russian children and “mentioned nothing about Mrs. Clinton.”

On Sunday, Trump Jr. said that Veselnitskaya's claims of having potentially helpful information were a ""pretext"" for the meeting's “true agenda” -- the adoption issue.

Mark Corallo, a spokesman for President Trump’s outside legal team, said, “The president was not aware of and did not attend the meeting.""

Several investigations into allegations of Russian meddling and possible collusion with the Trump campaign -- include an FBI probe and at least two congressional investigations -- have yet to produce clear evidence that the president or anybody on his campaign team colluded with Russia to defeat Clinton.

The meeting with Veselnitskaya was also attended by Paul J. Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman at the time, and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, according to The Times.

The Trump and Trump Jr. statements were included in The Times story Sunday.

Manafort and Kushner have disclosed the meeting in amended government documents. Kushner responded to the Saturday story, but neither has so far publicly commented on the Sunday report."

Trump Jr. was joined in the meeting by brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Manafort.

Zaino said Manafort has the experience to know when a meeting, like the one involving Veselnitskaya, crosses any legal or ethical boundaries.

""I think there was some malpractice on Paul Manafort's part,"" Zaino said. ""Somebody has to be protecting the family in these campaigns.""

Eric Bolling said Trump Jr and Manafort are allowed to meet with a wide range of people, but Zaino said this was a special case.

She said that when people deal with Russian nationals, they are dealing with people from America's primary global opponent.

Playing off Zaino's point, Juan Williams asked how much of this ethical standard Trump Jr. knew about himself.

“Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don Jr. attended in order to get info on an opponent. That’s politics!” Trump tweeted Monday.

In recent days, the president has posted multiple Twitter defenses of his son, Donald Trump Jr., in the wake of new revelations surrounding his June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with Kremlin-linked attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya and other associates.

Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort were known to have attended the meeting with Veselnitskaya and music publicist Rob Goldstone, who brokered the get-together promising campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton.

But as of Friday, the number of people known to have attended the controversial meeting grew to eight, including Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist who confirmed his attendance, and two others.

The meeting lasted just 20 minutes, but caused a massive headache for the White House by reigniting claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.

The president also tweeted on Sunday, slamming Clinton and questioning media coverage of the meeting.

“HillaryClinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate & delete 30,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?” Trump tweeted, referring to CNN debate questions allegedly leaked by former CNN contributor and DNC official Donna Brazile.

Natalia Veselnitskaya denied any connection to the Russian government in an interview with NBC News. Raising even more questions, she also denied having any damaging information about 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

“I never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton. It was never my intention to have that,” Veselnitskaya said.

Trump Jr., however, has confirmed that he originally went into the meeting with the impression the attorney might have information on Clinton useful to his dad’s campaign.

There are conflicting claims over how he might have gotten that impression.

“It’s quite possible that maybe they were looking for such information, they wanted it so badly,” Veselnitskaya said through a translator. She also told NBC she went to Trump Tower after getting a phone call from a man she didn't know and being told to meet with Trump Jr.

The Times reported overnight that music publicist Rob Goldstone had first indicated in an email to Trump Jr. that the Kremlin was the source of information about purported illegal campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee provided by Veselnitskaya.

Yet Goldstone told the Times earlier that he had no knowledge of Russian government involvement. And he said Veselnitskaya only offered a “vague, generic statement about the campaign's funding” – describing it as “inane nonsense” – before moving on to talk about a U.S. law that blacklists alleged Russian human rights abusers.

Trump Jr., his attorney and the White House have all downplayed the significance of the meeting.

Attorney Alan Futerfas, in an interview with Fox News, stressed that Veselnitskaya was “not a government official.”

Futerfas said she “claimed to have information” but “she had no information at all” and instead wanted to talk about opposition to the U.S. blacklist law.

""In my view, this is much ado about nothing,"" Futerfas said in a separate written statement, adding that Goldstone had contacted Trump Jr. late in the Republican primary campaign and ""suggested that people had information concerning alleged wrongdoing"" by Clinton.

""The meeting [with Veselnitskaya] lasted about 20-30 minutes and nothing came of it,"" Futerfas went on. ""His father knew nothing about it. The bottom line is that Don Jr. did nothing wrong.""

Trump Jr. on Tuesday called the meeting issue “nonsense.”

""Media & Dems are extremely invested in the Russia story. If this nonsense meeting is all they have after a yr, I understand the desperation!"" he tweeted.

The White House referred questions to the president's son. Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the president's outside legal team, would not comment on the Times story, reiterating only that the president ""was not aware of and did not attend the meeting.""

A White House spokeswoman said Donald Trump Jr. “did not collude with anybody.”

And earlier Monday, Trump Jr. tried to brush off the significance of the meeting, tweeting sarcastically, ""Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent ... went nowhere but had to listen.""

The Veselnitskaya meeting, which was also attended by Trump's then-campaign manager Paul Manafort and adviser Jared Kushner, is the first confirmed private meeting between members of President Trump’s inner circle and a Russian national.

Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Monday the Kremlin doesn't know Veselnitskaya and ""cannot keep track"" of every Russian lawyer who holds meetings in Russia or abroad. Although she has not been publicly linked with the Russian government itself, Veselnitskaya represented the son of a vice president of state-owned Russian Railways in a New York money-laundering case settled in May before a trial.

Lawmakers on the committee from both parties said they wanted to talk with the president's son. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the panel ""needs to interview him and others who attended the meeting."" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., agreed, saying, ""Based on his own admissions, this is an attempt at collusion.""

The president's eldest son seemed to readily accept the offer, according to the messages.

""My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency,"" President Trump said in a statement issued later on Tuesday.

The email chain -- purported to be between Trump Jr. and publicist Rob Goldstone -- occurred in June 2016. Goldstone went on to set up the controversial June 9 meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, whom he identified in the emails at one point as ""The Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow.""

READ THE EMAILS

""The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,"" an email identified as being from Goldstone said. It was the first email in the chain released by Trump Jr., who helped during his father's presidential campaign but is not part of his White House staff.

""This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump -- helped along by Aras and Emin.""

Trump Jr. said in a statement on Tuesday he knew ""Emin"" from helping to organize the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Russia. That person appears to be Emin Agalarov, whose father, Aras Agalarov, is a billionaire with reported ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Trump Jr. replied in the email chain: ""Seems we have some time and if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer.""

Veselnitskaya has since denied in an interview with NBC having ""any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton.""

""It was never my intention to have that,"" she said.

Donald Trump Jr. also has denied any wrongdoing occurred in the meeting, which also included then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior aide.

""The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was Political Opposition Research,"" Trump Jr. said in the Tuesday statement. ""I first wanted to just have a phone call but when they didn’t work out, they said the woman would be in New York and asked if I would meet. I decided to take the meeting...As Rob Goldstone said just today in the press, the entire meeting was 'the most insane nonsense I ever heard. And I was actually agitated by it.'""

The New York Times on Twitter said Trump Jr. only tweeted images of the emails after ""he was told NYT was about to publish the contents of the emails.""

The email disclosure is likely to embolden critics of President Trump and those attempting to link his campaign to alleged collusion with Russian officials. Even before the Trump Jr. emails became public, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., blasted the Trump administration.

“There’s no escaping it: the Trump Campaign’s inner circle met with an agent of a hostile foreign power to influence the outcome of an American election,"" Pelosi said in a Tuesday statement. ""The American people face a White House riddled with shadowy Russian connections and desperate to hide the truth.""

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., also hit Trump Jr. for the email chain.

""The email chain confirms that the President’s son was both aware of and supported the Russian government’s efforts to help the President get elected,"" Cummings said in a statement.

President Trump, via his outside legal representation, has denied knowing about or attending the meeting.

A spokesman for Vice President Pence also issued a statement distancing Pence from the mushrooming affair.

""The Vice President was not aware of the meeting,"" Vice Presidential Press Secretary Marc Lotter said. ""He is not focused on stories about the campaign, particularly stories about the time before he joined the ticket.""

In the initial June 3 email, Goldstone wrote that he could ""also send this info to your father via [his assistant] but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.""

Most of the rest of the email chain is scheduling minutiae, with Trump trying to arrange a phone call and then working out a suitable meeting time with Goldstone's contact.

There is nothing contained in the emails to suggest Trump Jr. was informed of the larger alleged Russian effort to meddle in the U.S. presidential election.

President Trump tweeted at Aras about Emin following the Miss Universe Pageant in 2013: ""@AgalarovAras I had a great weekend with you and your family. You have done a FANTASTIC job. TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next. EMIN was WOW!"""

Follow Her On Twitter']",FOX News,"Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer in July 2016 after learning she had damaging information about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic opponent of now-President Trump.

But Trump Jr. and other key figures involved in the meeting downplayed the gathering when questioned by Senate investigators.

“The meeting provided no meaningful information and turned out to be not about what was represented,” Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to recently released transcripts. He contended that the meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was actually regarding a Russian adoption prohibition.

So what was this meeting about?

Before Trump Jr. was set to meet with the Russian lawyer as his father campaigned for the presidency, Trump Jr. was told Veselnitskaya’s potentially damning information about Clinton was from the Kremlin, according to emails he released.

Trump Jr. has maintained that Veselnitskaya did not have any information to share and instead wanted to discuss other matters, such as the Magnitsky Act which enacts sanctions on certain Russian officials as punishment for human rights violations.

“After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton,” Trump Jr. said in a statement.

“Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered,” Trump Jr. continued

Was anyone else at the meeting?

Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort also attended the meeting, along with a translator.

Rob Goldstone, a music publicist who set up the meeting, was also in attendance, as well as Rinat Akhmetshin, a prominent Russian-American lobbyist, Ike Kaveladze, a business associate of a Moscow-based developer and a translator.

A spokesperson for Trump’s outside legal team said Trump “was not aware of and did not attend the meeting.” Trump Jr. said he “wouldn’t have wasted his time” by telling him about the meeting.

Didn’t Trump Jr. publish the emails about the meeting?

Trump Jr. posted screenshots of multiple emails purportedly from Goldstone.

In a June 3, 2016 email, Goldstone said he was asked to “contact you with something very interesting.”

“The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary [Clinton] and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,” Goldstone said.

He added that the information was “very high level and sensitive” but was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”

Trump Jr. responded in less than 20 minutes saying that he wanted to check out the information first, but “if it’s what you say I love it especially later in summer.”

In another email, Goldstone referred to Veselnitskaya as “the Russian government attorney.”

So did Trump Jr. break the law?

As Trump Jr. does not have a position in his father’s administration, he is not required to disclose foreign contacts, according to The Associated Press.

Foreign nationals are prohibited from providing ""anything of value"" to campaigns, and that same law also bars solicitation of such assistance. The law typically applies to monetary campaign contributions, but courts could consider information such as opposition research to be something of value.

Trump Jr. told the Senate committee that if he had been given any information about Clinton, he would have consulted with counsel on what to do with it.

Bradley A. Smith, a former Bill Clinton-appointed Republican Federal Election Commission member, said based on what's known about the meeting, Trump Jr.'s actions are unlikely to be considered illegal solicitation.

""It's not illegal to meet with someone to find out what they have to offer,"" Smith said.

But Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the FEC, said the situation ""raises all sorts of red flags.""

""You do not want your campaign to be involved with foreign nationals, period,"" said Noble.

The company, founded in 2010 by former Wall Street Journal reporters Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch, is named in a complaint that has had international implications. It was filed by Hermitage Capital Management, run by Bill Browder, who was Russia’s top investment manager before his dealings there encountered tragedy, and ultimately resulted in the current wide-ranging U.S. sanctions against top Putin officials.

Attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, who met with Trump Jr. in June 2016, was working for a Cyprus-based real estate holdings company called Prevezon, run by Denis Katsyv, son of Pyotr Katsyv, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest advisers. She was given “unlimited resources” by the Kremlin-connected group to run a campaign to get the Magnitsky Act repealed, Browder told Fox News.

“The idea was discredit your opponent. It was essentially a coup attempt by PR."" — Christopher Davidson of Durham University

The Magnitsky Act is named after Browder’s former attorney Sergei Magnitsky, who was beaten to death in a Moscow prison after accusing Russian authorities of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars through tax refunds and then laundering the money through New York banks. The scheme was allegedly run by Prevezon Holdings, whose attorney Veselnitskaya was working to get the sanctions reversed.

“They were trying to completely change the narrative of what happened to Sergei. Their objective was to have the Magnitsky Act repealed,” Browder said. “They can’t change the truth of what happened to a man who was murdered in order to achieve some sort of political objective.”

Browder told Fox News that Simpson was retained by Prevezon Holdings via a law firm, BakerHostetler, for his expertise and contacts with the Washington and New York media. That law firm had represented Simpson on prior cases, and the Russians looked to it for legal help as well as lobbying access to Capitol Hill.

Others involved were a Washington-based group called Potomac Square, run by another former Wall Street Journal reporter, Chris Cooper, as well as a D.C.-based lobbyist suspected of ties to Russian intelligence, Rinat Akhmetshin.

According to lobbying disclosures reviewed by Fox News, Akhmetshin founded a group called the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation. The group’s website is largely “under construction.” Denis Katsyv, whose father runs Prevezon Holdings, appears on the lobbying disclosure form.

Akhmetshin had led the way in getting a movie that attempted to influence public and official opinion about the Magnitsky Act shown at Washington’s respected Newseum on June 13, 2016. Several screenings of the movie had been canceled in Europe because it was a “crude attempt to smear Magnitsky and Browder,” according to a report by Radio Free Europe.

Akhmetshin told RFE that Potomac Square Group, which had circulated news articles critical of Browder to reporters, paid for the event with the expectation of being reimbursed by his foundation.

As for Simpson, he was “using all of his media contacts to get a smear campaign going against Magnitsky and myself,” Browder said. “He also seems to be able to get articles stopped. Simpson has unusual influence because he was often a big source to these reporters on other stories.”

Around the same time in June 2016, Veselnitskaya scored her meeting with Donald Trump Jr. after luring him in with emails indicating there was “dirt” on former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. “Veselnitskaya probably tried 12 different angles to get to Trump and also to Clinton for that matter,” Browder said. “She had every possible incentive to get to both sides” since her goal was to get the Magnitsky Act repealed, and apparently not to influence the U.S. election.

Meanwhile, according to Browder, attorneys from BakerHostetler were briefing the House Foreign Affairs Committee on their “false narrative” on Magnitsky.

In a company statement, an official confirmed the relationship. ""Fusion GPS was engaged by a U.S. law firm, BakerHostetler, to perform public records litigation support in a U.S. asset seizure case, U.S. v Prevezon,” the statement read. “Its work is a matter of public record. Fusion GPS is not a lobbying firm and engaged in no lobbying in this case. Any suggestion to the contrary is entirely false.”

But as Browder points out, Fusion was providing media influence, rather than lobbying work on Capitol Hill.

In its statement, Fusion said it had nothing to do with the Trump Jr. meeting.

“Fusion GPS learned about this meeting from news reports and had no prior knowledge of it. Any claim that Fusion GPS arranged or facilitated this meeting in any way is absolutely false,” the statement read.

There is also no evidence that the work Fusion did for Prevezon Holdings and the Russians was related to the Trump “dossier,” which was crafted by a former MI-6 agent named Christopher Steele and made various sordid and still uncorroborated allegations about President Donald Trump.

However, Browder speculates that it is possible Simpson’s work with the Russian lobbyist, and possible spy, Akhmetshin, on the Prevezon case may have facilitated his work on the Trump “dossier.”

Most experts believe the “dossier” was commissioned by Trump’s domestic political enemies, possibly even Republicans.

Akhmetshin “is effectively a Russian spy in close contact with Simpson,” said Browder. “He could have easily fed some misinformation into the dossier” regardless who was paying for it.

Browder filed a complaint with the Justice Department against Simpson, Akhmetshin, Potomac Square, BakerHostetler, Veselnitskaya and others last July. He met with DOJ lawyers in Washington, “and that was the last time I ever heard from them.”

As for Fusion GPS, its work with Prevezon mirrored in certain ways what it did for other clients. For example, Simpson and a prominent Democratic group called California Strategies teamed up on a PR campaign in 2010 for an exiled United Arab Emirates sheikh that involved a 37-page dossier, Facebook and Twitter accounts, and other media and advertising efforts.

The Guardian newspaper reported that, “other tactics explored and employed ranged from raking up a sex scandal … and meeting Hillary Clinton on visits to Washington.”

“It was war through PR,” said Christopher Davidson of Durham University. “The idea was discredit your opponent. It was essentially a coup attempt by PR. The campaign was very extensive. It was a new type of coup.”

“Bottom line: Simpson is very secretive. He is for hire,” said billionaire Idaho businessman Frank VanderSloot, whose support for former presidential candidate Mitt Romney landed him on Simpson’s radar in 2012.

Simpson asked a Democratic operative to dig up dirt on VanderSloot. “His business model is, ‘Do you want to destroy somebody’s life or somebody’s business? OK, I will destroy his life if you pay me enough.’ His job is to destroy the target by digging up dirt and getting that dirt published.”

In a declaration to the D.C. Superior Court that was hearing VanderSloot’s case in 2014, Simpson wrote, “Regardless of the assignment, Fusion GPS’s clients demand that we maintain their identity, and the nature of their request, as confidential. Many, if not most, of Fusion GPS’s clients would not engage our services if they believed that we would disclose their identity, or the nature of the research that we provided them.”

Efforts to reach Glenn Simpson, Akhmetshin, Veselnitskaya and BakerHostetler for this report were unsuccessful, and the Department of Justice would not comment on Browder’s complaint."

Meanwhile, the former Indiana governor is stoking speculation about his future plans as he ramps up political activities and courts party donors, including keynoting a conference of young Republicans this weekend in Washington.

All this while some Democrats are now backing efforts to remove President Trump from office – an unlikely outcome because of Republican majorities in Congress but one that would put Pence in the nation's highest office.

On Friday, House minority leader Nancy Pelosi said Democrats “need more evidence” but said she “will not close that door” on trying to impeach Trump.

Her comments follow revelations about Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting this week with a Russian lawyer, which have emboldened the president’s critics who argue it shows evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

In an attempt to further distance the vice president from Russia controversies, Pence’s aides were quick to emphasize that the vice president had not even joined the campaign at the time of Trump Jr.’s meeting.

“The vice president was not aware of the meeting,” Pence press secretary Marc Lotter said. “He is not focused on stories about the campaign, particularly stories about the time before he joined the ticket.""

The meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya occurred June 9, 2016. Pence was announced as Trump’s running mate more than a month later on July 16.

Lotter emphasized this week to the New York Times that Pence had no meetings with anyone associated with the Russian government during the campaign or transition.

Despite the drama, Pence himself is keeping up appearances as an enthusiastic partner to Trump, using his Twitter account to demonstrate loyalty to the president as the Trump Jr. email controversy dominates headlines.

“Many Media & Dems will try to stop us but now more than ever we owe the American people to continue to deliver what @POTUS & I campaigned on,” Pence tweeted on Wednesday.

In another tweet, the vice president tweeted an image that said: “Thanks to the leadership of President Trump, we are in the midst of a great national renewal.”

As he sought to distance the vice president from the controversy involving Trump Jr., Pence’s spokesman also went out his way to express Pence’s allegiance to Trump.

“The vice president is working every day to advance the president's agenda, which is what the American people sent us here to do,” Lotter said.

On Wednesday, two liberal Democratic congressmen introduced an article of impeachment that accused Trump of obstruction of justice over his firing of former FBI Director James Comey. They argued the president was improperly trying to shut down the bureau’s investigation into any ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia during the presidential race.

The House is highly unlikely to move on the measure, as it takes a majority of House members to pass an article of impeachment. Even if the GOP-led House were to pass impeachment articles, the GOP-controlled Senate would then vote to acquit or convict.

But as he promoted his effort, one of the sponsors, California Rep. Brad Sherman, acknowledged the prospect of Pence assuming the presidency.

“I served with Mike Pence in Congress for twelve years and I disagree with him on just about everything,” Sherman said. “I never dreamed I would author a measure that would put him in the White House.”

As his political future is speculated upon, Pence will deliver a speech Saturday night at an event sponsored by Maverick PAC. The group is made up of young Republicans who are active in fundraising and work in a variety of industries, including oil and gas, banking, food and beverage, communications, technology and politics.

His appearance follows other recent instances of invigorating his political activity. The New York Times reported that Pence has recently been courting donors, corporate executives and conservative leaders during private gatherings at his residence at the Naval Observatory.

And in May, Pence filed paperwork to start his own leadership PAC, called the Great America Committee, which he can use to funnel money to GOP congressional campaigns. An adviser said at the time that the PAC was being set up to support Trump's legislative agenda.

Mo Elleithee pushed back, pointing out that the emails released by Trump Jr. show that he was aware that Veselnitskaya claimed to have damning information about Clinton, which she would share as part of the Russian government's attempt to help the Trump campaign.

Even if she ended up having no actual dirt on Clinton, Trump Jr. still took the meeting, Elleithee said.

Kucinich said he understands Elleithee's concerns, but he doesn't see how Trump Jr. violated campaign finance law, which in this case would be accepting a campaign contribution or donation from a foreign national.

""The law reads 'receiving something of value,'"" Kucinich explained. ""He didn't receive anything of value. It was nothing. ... If it's nothing, it's nothing. And nothing plus nothing equals nothing. And I don't think there's anything here.""

""We've spent a lot of time on this, and it's going nowhere,"" he added. ""I don't care how many investigations they have. I've seen these kind of investigations going nowhere.""

He Is The Author Of The No. New York Times Best-Selling Book']",FOX News,"Erasmus, the noted classical scholar, described lawyers this way: A most learned species of profoundly ignorant men.

He had a point. How else do you explain the wild pronouncements of lawyers like Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe, former White House ethics lawyer Richard Painter and Senator Tim Kaine, D-Virginia? Each have suggested Donald Trump Jr. committed treason by meeting with a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya.

All three lawyers earned their degrees at Harvard or Yale. Yet, they appear to have slept through their class on constitutional law.

Treason? Preposterous

Treason is defined in Article 3 of the Constitution and codified in 18 USC 2381: “Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, either levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort with the U.S. or elsewhere.”

Meeting with a Russian lawyer is not treason. The U.S. is not at war with Russia. Even if the president’s son received information from the Russian government or otherwise collaborated with foreign officials, it constitutes neither waging war against the U.S. nor aiding the enemy.

If it were otherwise, a myriad of Republican and Democratic Senators who admit meeting with the Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, might be somehow guilty of treason. In these meetings, information is surely exchanged. No one has ever suggested it rises to the level of criminality. Indeed, it is what diplomats and foreign officials do. It is what our own officials do in foreign lands.

Collusion has nothing to do with elections and political campaigns. Which renders special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation meaningless. He is tasked with finding a crime that does not exist in the law. It is a legal impossibility.

Even if the Trump campaign had acted on information provided by the Russian lawyer, it would still not constitute treason. Even conspiring to subvert the government does not rise to the level of treason. Under our Constitution, Americans are permitted to speak against the government, undermine political opponents, support harmful policies or even place the interests of another nation ahead of those of the U.S.

You would think these lawyers, however misguided by their political prejudices, would nevertheless comprehend such a fundamental principle of constitutional and statutory law. Clearly, they do not.

Each harbor their own biases which have blinded them to the law. Tribe and Painter sued President Trump within days of his taking office. They claim his many business dealings violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. Their case is without merit.

Kaine might be described as a “sore loser,” having lost the presidential election as Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential running mate.

Before perpetuating the treason canard, these lawyers should reread the famous 1953 case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. They were convicted of espionage after providing nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union. They were not charged with treason because the U.S. was not “at war” with the Soviets.

So let’s dispense with all this silliness over treason.

Collusion? No Such Thing

Now, amid the cacophony of claims that the Trump campaign committed the criminal offense of “collusion” with the Russians, no one has managed to point to a statute that makes colluding with a foreign government in a political campaign a crime. Why? Because it cannot be found anywhere in America’s criminal codes.

As explained in an earlier column, “collusion” is a loaded word conjuring all manner of incriminating behavior. Yet, it exists only in anti-trust laws which forbid price fixing and other anti-competitive activities under Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

Collusion has nothing whatsoever to do with elections and political campaigns. Of course, that inconvenient fact has not stopped politicians, pundits and journalists from either misunderstanding the concept and/or misconstruing its application to the Trump-Russia hysteria.

It also renders special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation meaningless. He is tasked with finding a crime that does not exist in the law. It is a legal impossibility.

The only conceivable crime tangentially related to collusion is found at 18 USC 371, entitled “Conspiracy to Defraud the United States.” It makes it a felony for two or more persons to enter into an agreement to interfere or obstruct a lawful function of the government. An election would be a lawful government function. However, it must be done by “deceitful or dishonest means.”

So let’s suppose, for the sake of argument, that the Russian lawyer provided information damaging to the Clinton campaign and the Trump campaign then acted on the material by disseminating it to the public. How is that deceitful or dishonest? It is not.

But this is not what happened, as best we know. According to Trump Jr., the lawyer offered no information at all. Indeed, the lawyer insists the subject of the campaign was never broached.

Let’s play another “what if.” What if the Russian lawyer handed Trump Jr. a file and said, “here is information which we hacked from the DNC and the Clinton campaign?” If the president’s son accepted the file, then he could be accused of knowingly receiving stolen property. But again, there is no evidence this ever happened.

It is worth remembering that the hacked information was not made public by Wikileaks until after the June 9th meeting. Months later, in October, the U.S. government officially acknowledged Russian interference in the election.

There is one final law to be considered. Under the Federal Election Campaign Act, soliciting and/or receiving foreign donations is prohibited (11 CFR 110.20). This includes “money or other thing of value.” Is information, by itself, a “thing of value?” One could attempt to make that argument, but it has never been interpreted that way. To the contrary, the law specifically states that ""services"" are not contributions and that foreign nationals are permitted to volunteer their services to U.S. political campaigns.

Moreover, campaign election laws are rarely the subject of criminal prosecutions. The vast majority of cases are civil violations resulting in fines. But again, both Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer agree that no information related to the presidential campaign was conveyed. If true, this statute is inapplicable.

As much as President Trump’s opponents may wish it to be, it is not a crime to meet with a Russian. Nor is it a crime to meet with a Russian lawyer or government official. Even gathering information from a foreign source is permissible. Unwise and ill-advised, yes. Illegal, no.

Until such time as Congress decides to pass a bill – and the president signs it into law – criminalizing “collusion” with a foreign government in an American political campaign … no law has been broken here."

The meeting, which paired Donald Trump Jr. and Kremlin-linked attorney Natalia Veselnitska reportedly lasted just 20 minutes, but has caused massive headaches for the Trump White House by reigniting claims the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.

Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort were known to have attended the meeting with Veselnitskaya and music publicist Rob Goldstone, who brokered the get-together promising campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton.

Rinat Akhmetshin, who NBC identified as a Russian-American lobbyist, confirmed his participation to the Associated Press. Akhmetshin denied reports he has ties to Russian intelligence agencies. He told the AP Trump Jr. asked Veselnitskaya for evidence of illicit money flowing to the Democratic National Committee, but Veselnitskaya said she did not have that information.

Akhmetshin also reportedly said that “they couldn’t wait for the meeting to end,” referring to Trump Jr., Manafort and Kushner.

Two more men are believed to have attended the meeting, including former State Department contractor Anatoli Samochornov, who has ties to Veselnitskaya, and another man. A State Department source said Samochornov was never an employee and that the department does not provide translators for non-government private meetings.

Trump Jr.’s attorney, Alan Futerfas, told Fox News he could not confirm Samochornov was at the meeting, but said one of the two other attendees was a U.S. citizen. Other reports characterized an unnamed attendee as a “former Russian counter-intelligence officer” and a friend of Russian singer and billionaire scion Emin Agalarov.

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the growing and still mysterious meeting roster “adds another deeply disturbing fact about this secret meeting.”

“Whether the additional party or parties present during the meeting with these top Trump campaign personnel at the time Donald Trump had seized the nomination were connected directly with Russia intelligence or not, it is clear the Kremlin got the message that Donald Trump welcomed the help of the Russian government in providing dirt on Hillary Clinton,” Schiff said.

Neither Kushner's attorney nor spokesperson, have commented on this. Goldstone and Manafort did not respond to Fox News' request to comment.

Trump to Pat Robertson: Putin Would've Preferred 'President Hillary Clinton'

Author and commentator Mark Steyn dismissed the notion that Russian President Vladimir Putin was pulling the strings behind the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.

""The guy [who Trump Jr.] is colluding with is a washed-up pop music publicist for John Denver in the 1980s,"" Steyn, a ""Rush Limbaugh Show"" guest host, said.

Steyn said Robert Goldstone, who he said is now a publicist for a pop star in Azerbaijan, would never be someone Putin would confide in to collude with the Trumps.

However, Steyn said because her name is now in the news, Veselnitskaya probably has newfound ""ties"" to the Kremlin.

He said the idea floated by Democrats and some Republicans that Putin would do such a thing ""ludicrous.""

Steyn said there'd be no way for a person to be charged for ""colluding with the publicist for an Azerbaijani pop singer.""

""A sleazy bar in Baku is a good place to find a couple of Baku singers [though],"" Steyn said, playing off the Azerbaijani capital's name.

In a bizarre turn of events, the attorney is now implicating Rob Goldstone – Agalarov’s publicist – as the person who made up key parts of the story.

“It’s the way the Russians do things -- deny, deny, deny.” — Andrew McCarthy, former federal prosecutor

The surprising legal strategy by New York-based Scott Balber, attorney for Agalarov – known by the stage name Emin -- and his Moscow developer father, Aras Agalarov, could have important ramifications for the special counsel investigation into alleged Trump administration ties to Russia, experts told Fox News. The elder Agalarov had helped President Donald Trump bring the Miss Universe pageant to Russia in 2013.

Goldstone, founder of Oui 2 Entertainment in New York, emailed Trump Jr. on June 3, 2016, writing, “the Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his (Emin’s) father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some useful documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

“The reality is that there was never a conversation between Aras Agalarov and Russian prosecutors about Hillary Clinton’s campaign, or about the U.S. election at all -- ever,” Balber told Fox News. “There were certainly no conversations between Mr. Agalarov and the Russian government, or the Russian federal prosecutors in that time frame on any topic. It’s just fiction.”

The subsequent email traffic between Trump Jr. and Goldstone suggests a phone call was to be scheduled with Emin in mid-June 2016. But Balber told Fox News that any call that might have happened was not about the Clinton campaign.

“I never denied that there were any calls ever between (Emin and Trump Jr.),” Balber said. “What I did deny was that there was a call about this topic.”

Emin has been called the “Russian Ricky Martin” for his flashy stage presence, which includes colorful imagery such as wearing a tiara and a Miss Universe sash. Goldstone has been known to hang out at Manhattan’s swanky Russian Tea Room.

While they are connected to powerful figures in the U.S. and Russia, Emin and Goldstone are not known to have political experience themselves. And that perception is central to the case Balber is making to the public. He said Goldstone was trying to “create intrigue” for the purpose of getting a meeting set up.

“Goldstone is a music industry publicist who was trying to accomplish something for his important client and used an awful lot of puffery and hyperbole and fantasy to try and secure that meeting,” Balber told Fox News.

If that seems hard to fathom, legal experts contacted by Fox News said the strategy could be critical to keeping special counsel Robert Mueller or other investigators at arm's length in the months ahead.

“It’s the way the Russians do things -- deny, deny, deny,” said former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy. “It’s more along the lines of KGB than defense lawyer. Basically, they’re just trying to show there’s nothing here but what Goldstone ginned up in his mind.”

That means Goldstone’s version of what was behind the emails and the meeting is important for understanding what happened, McCarthy said.

“There could be no case unless Goldstone talks,” McCarthy told Fox News, “the email is hearsay. It’s what Goldstone says Agalarov said. It would be very hard to get that in a courtroom unless you get somebody talking.”

When Fox News reached out to Goldstone for his version of events, he directed reporters to his attorney, who has not responded to requests for comment.

Other legal experts said it is possible that Goldstone may indeed have invented the Clinton “dirt” pretext for the meeting with Trump Jr. Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer at the meeting, insists she had no information about Clinton. Trump Jr. said the brief discussion about Clinton made no sense.

Veselnitskaya was actually lobbying at the time for the repeal of the Magnitsky Act, which levied sanctions against the Putin regime in response to the murder of Sergei Magnitsky, a 37-year-old lawyer for a London-based investor in Russian prison.

If the focus of the Trump Jr. meeting was indeed repeal of the Magnitsky Act, “there's no crime,” said Fox News anchor and former defense attorney Gregg Jarrett.

“The First Amendment provides a complete protection for such meetings,” Jarrett said. “It is not a violation of federal election laws, because anyone is allowed to volunteer ‘personal services’ and information to political campaigns, even foreign nationals.”

The law specifically states such services are not donations, which would otherwise be prohibited from foreigners, Jarrett said."

“Do you really think they would have had five people in a meeting if this was about collusion with Russia?” Kingston, a former senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said as he defended Donald Trump Jr.’s June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya. “It just defies logic.”

Rye responded: “There are a lot of things that your president has done to defy logic—let’s at least acknowledge that.”

“Your president too, Angela. Your president, too,” Kingston fired back.

“Well, he’s your president,” Rye said again, refusing to call Trump “her” president.

CNN host John Berman chimed in to moderate the discussion and said, “the president of the United States.”

Follow Her On Twitter At']",FOX News,"The head of the firm behind the infamous anti-Trump dossier was interviewed for hours behind closed doors Tuesday on Capitol Hill, sources confirmed to Fox News.

Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of investigative firm Fusion GPS, met with staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee as part of the committee’s investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with the Trump campaign in the 2016 presidential election.

A committee spokesperson did not give Fox News any further information on the meeting with Simpson and Judiciary staff, though a source confirmed that Fusion GPS has given the Senate committee over 40,000 documents.

""Mr. Simpson told Congress the truth and cleared the

record on many matters of interest to congressional investigators,"" his attorney Josh Levy told Fox News.

Simpson's company was behind the dossier that was compiled during last year's campaign and which contained crude allegations against now-President Trump.

Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and committee Ranking Member Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., originally had issued a subpoena for Simpson’s testimony at a public hearing before the committee last month. But they withdrew it after Simpson reached arrangements to interview with the committee in private.

RUSSIA PROBE: DEMOCRATS BLOCK KEY WITNESS AGAINST SHADOWY FIRM FUSION GPS

The committee’s hearing in July pertained to oversight of the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). At the public session, CEO and founder of Hermitage Capital Bill Browder testified that Fusion GPS and Simpson worked “on behalf of the Russian government” in an effort to fight U.S. sanctions that had enraged Moscow’s elite.

Browder told lawmakers that Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who met with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower in June 2016, also was responsible for hiring Simpson to “conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of a congressional hearing on the Global Magnitsky Act.” The Magnitsky Act is a U.S. law that brings sanctions against Russian oligarchs suspected of money laundering.

After the hearing, Fusion GPS responded to Browder’s allegations -- saying they had “complied with the law” and were “not required to register under FARA,” and “did not spread false information about William Browder or Sergei Magnitsky.”

“What is clear is that the president and his allies are desperately trying to smear Fusion GPS because it investigated Donald Trump’s ties to Russia,” Fusion GPS said in a statement to Fox News last month. “They have pulled out all the stops, including this false allegation about FARA.”"

The paper reported that music publicist Rob Goldstone indicated in an email to Trump Jr. that the Kremlin was the source of information about purported illegal campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee provided by attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.

""In my view, this is much ado about nothing,"" said attorney Alan Futerfas, who said that Goldstone had contacted Trump Jr. late in the Republican primary campaign and ""suggested that people had information concerning alleged wrongdoing"" by Clinton.

""The meeting [with Veselnitskaya] lasted about 20-30 minutes and nothing came of it,"" Futerfas went on. ""His father knew nothing about it. The bottom line is that Don Jr. did nothing wrong.""

The White House referred questions to the president's son. Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the president's outside legal team, would not comment on the Times story, reiterating only that the president ""was not aware of and did not attend the meeting.""

Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said the Times report proved ""Donald Jr. was willing to accept the help of a hostile foreign government to sway the election. In the ensuing months, the Trump family watched as news of the Kremlin’s hacking campaign developed and they did nothing but celebrate and encourage it to continue.

""It is time for Donald Trump, his family, and his team to stop lying and come clean about their contacts with Russia, what they knew about the Kremlin’s effort to help them, and when they knew it,"" Watson added.

Goldstone confirmed earlier Monday that he had set up the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya on behalf of his client, singer Emin Agalarov.

In a statement Sunday, Trump Jr. acknowledged taking the meeting to learn damaging information about Clinton, but claimed that Veselnitskaya allegations were ""vague, ambiguous and made no sense” and it “became clear that she had no meaningful information.”

The Times story, which cited three unnamed people with knowledge of Goldstone's email but did not relate the actual email text, was the third report in as many days concerning the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya.

In response to a Times report published Saturday, Trump Jr. said the meeting was primarily about allowing Americans to adopt Russian children and “mentioned nothing about Mrs. Clinton.” Responding to the paper's Sunday report, Trump Jr. acknowledged that he was told Veselnitskaya ""might have information helpful to the campaign.""

The Veselnitskaya meeting, which was also attended by Trump's then-campaign manager Paul Manafort and adviser Jared Kushner, is the first confirmed private meeting between members of President Trump’s inner circle and a Russian national. If the content of Goldstone's email is confirmed, it would be the first public word that Trump Jr. had been made aware the material could have been emanating from the Kremlin.

Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Monday the Kremlin doesn't know Veselnitskaya and ""cannot keep track"" of every Russian lawyer who holds meetings in Russia or abroad. Although she has not been publicly linked with the Russian government itself, Veselnitskaya represented the son of a vice president of state-owned Russian Railways in a New York money-laundering case settled in May before a trial.

Trump spent time with Agalarov during his visit to Moscow for the 2013 Miss Universe pageant, which Trump owned at the time. The real estate mogul appeared in a music video with Agalarov and several pageant contestants. Agalarov's father, Aras, is a Russian developer who sought to partner with Trump on a hotel project in Moscow and tried to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin during the Miss Universe contest.

Earlier Monday, Trump Jr. tried to brush off the significance of the meeting, tweeting sarcastically, ""Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent ... went nowhere but had to listen.""



Trump Jr. also said on Twitter he was willing to work with the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the panels probing possible campaign collusion, ""to pass on what I know.""



Lawmakers on the committee from both parties said they indeed wanted to talk with the president's son. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the panel ""needs to interview him and others who attended the meeting."" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., agreed, saying, ""Based on his own admissions, this is an attempt at collusion.""

White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders read the statement from the president during Tuesday’s off-camera press briefing, before referring questions on the matter to Donald Trump Jr.'s outside counsel.

“My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency,” the statement said.

Sanders had adamantly defended the president's son a day earlier. But the emails, which Donald Trump Jr. released on Twitter earlier Tuesday, quickly have caused new headaches for the administration.

What was described as the ""entire email chain"" showed the discussions that led up to a 2016 meeting between the president's son and a Russian attorney who supposedly claimed to have information that could “incriminate” Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign.

The email from the contact who set up the meeting with attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya described the offer as “part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.” Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort also attended.

Sanders told reporters that the president learned of the meeting in the last couple of days, and did not know the last time he spoke to his son.

DONALD TRUMP JR. RELEASES 'ENTIRE EMAIL CHAIN' REGARDING RUSSIAN MEETING

Trump Jr. released a new statement, along with the email chain, on Twitter, explaining he was releasing the messages “in order to be totally transparent.” The New York Times suggested on Twitter that Trump Jr. only shared images of the emails after “he was told NYT was about to publish the contents of the emails.”

Some top-ranking lawmakers now are seeking Trump Jr.'s testimony. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., top Democrat on the judiciary committee, said Trump Jr. and others should ""come before the committee, in open session, as soon as possible.""

Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, when asked about the intelligence committee's plans to reach out to the president's son, said he couldn't ""imagine a world"" where that doesn't happen.

Sanders pushed back when challenged during Tuesday's briefing on the president's claim of “transparency.”

Sanders added: “The willingness to [answer questions] is fully transparent and open to do so through the correct process, whether that’s through special counsel or anyone beyond that.”

When also asked about the relationship between President Trump and Vice President Pence, Sanders replied: “There is absolutely no distance between the president and the vice president.”

Sanders told reporters Trump and Pence spoke on Tuesday, but did not know if they spoke about the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya. Pence’s press secretary, Marc Lotter, separately told Fox News on Tuesday that “the Vice President was not aware of the meeting.”

DONALD TRUMP JR. 'DID NOT COLLUDE WITH ANYBODY,' WHITE HOUSE SAYS

“He is not focused on stories about the campaign, particularly stories about the time before he joined the ticket,” Lotter said.

President Trump, through his outside counsel, also has denied knowing about or attending the meeting.

“I stand by everything I said yesterday,” Sanders assured reporters on Tuesday. “I think the president is frustrated with ... the fact that this continues to be an issue and he would love for us to be focused on things like economy, health care, tax reform, and infrastructure and that’s where his mind is, and what he’d like to be discussing.”

A day earlier, Sanders said Trump Jr. he “did not collude with anybody to influence the election.”

Trump Jr. accepted the June 9, 2016 meeting offered by publicist Rob Goldstone, who identified Veselnitskaya as “the Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow.”

Revelations and details surrounding the meeting have given Democrats further ammunition in their claims that Trump associates potentially colluded with the Russians during the 2016 election.

“This is a pattern we’ve seen from senior-level Trump officials that has gone back months where they deny these contacts or meetings with Russians until proof comes out, then they have to recant,” Ranking Member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., told Fox News on Tuesday.

“These emails show there is no longer a question of whether this campaign sought to collude with a hostile foreign power to subvert America’s democracy,” Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said.

But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told Fox News on Capitol Hill Tuesday that the Senate Intelligence Committee would look into the matter.

“I'm sure that Senator Warner and Burr will take a look at it,” McConnell said. “They'll get to the bottom of what happened.”

During a session titled “Weed Nation,” Stone threw verbal bombs at the Trump administration, accusing it of wanting to “re-fire up the war on drugs.”

But during a separate session on Watergate -- which was really about the Trump-Russia probe – Stone seemed more ready to defend the president and his team.

For example, Stone said there was one key difference between the scandal that brought down Richard Nixon and the current media frenzy surrounding the White House.

“Watergate started with a crime,” Stone said, referring to the burglary that launched the case. But he said he saw no evidence of crime in contacts between Trump’s team and Russians.

In fact, Stone said he saw more parallels between the Nixon era and the Obama years than between Nixon and Trump, asserting the Obama administration had conducted surveillance on “tens of thousands” of Americans.

He also said the charge that Russians had hacked computers of the Democratic National Committee was “entirely unproven.”

What was Stone’s answer for the media lynch mobs and others going after Trump and Co.?

“You don’t have any evidence to impeach Trump,” Stone said, “and your motivation is entirely political.”

""You don’t have any evidence to impeach Trump, and your motivation is entirely political.” — Roger Stone, political consultant

Stone said Russia lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya had entered the U.S. without a visa and had posted photos online from an anti-Trump rally and from inside the office of Republican Sen. John McCain, a frequent Trump critic.

“I find that troubling,” Stone said. “I smell a set-up.”

Other Stone barbs:

On Sean Spicer: “He shouldn’t let the door hit him in the ass on the way out.”

On George W. Bush: Bush “snorted so much cocaine, he had a personal thank-you note from Pablo Escobar.”

On Trump’s military transgender ban: “I disagree with that entirely.”

Regarding marijuana, Stone said Trump needed to stick to his campaign position of leaving pot policy to the states, adding he didn’t think the president was truly aligned with the “drug warriors” on his team anyway.

Stone warned that Trump could lose voter support by taking a hard line on marijuana. Medical marijuana, for example, was a “consensus issue,” he said, with lots of voter support.

The war on drugs, meanwhile, was largely an “expensive racist failure,” Stone said. He charged that the Clinton administration had incarcerated an “entire generation of young black men” for mostly “small amounts of pot.”

Politicon, billed as an independent forum, unaffiliated with any political organizations, parties or political action committees, was scheduled to conclude Sunday at the Pasadena Convention Center.

Newly hired White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci had been scheduled to appear at the event, but canceled following his recent interview with the New Yorker magazine, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

Donald Trump Jr. wanted oppo on Hillary,"['Howard Kurtz', 'Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst', 'The Host Of']",FOX News,"We have been through nearly a year of media reports about President Trump’s campaign and possible Russian collusion that have generally amounted to much smoke and little fire.

I’ve repeatedly said that while the press has found instances where officials have not been forthcoming—going back to the reason the president fired Mike Flynn—many journalists have shifted from collusion to coverup because there’s so little evidence of any wrongdoing related to Russia.

In fact, much of the war of words between Trump and the media revolves around his conviction that the whole collusion story is fake news and their refusal to accept that view.

But the latest New York Times story is in a different category.

And it reminds us that the best course for any administration under scrutiny is to get the information out quickly, even damaging information, and try to move on. The drip-drip-drip approach not only creates the appearance of hiding things, it stretches the story out for weeks or months.

The Times reported that “Donald Trump Jr. was promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton before agreeing to meet with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign.” Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner also attended the June 2016 meeting with Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya.



The piece, which updates a day earlier story, was based on “three advisers to the White House briefed on the meeting and two others with knowledge of it”—so it reflects the administration’s damage control.

And one problem is that Don Jr., in his first statement for the original story, said nothing about any oppo on Clinton. He said that “we primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children.” (What this means is Moscow’s desire to end a U.S. law designed to punish officials responsible for the death of a Russian activist, which prompted Vladimir Putin to end the adoption program.)

But in the statement for the second Times story, Don Jr. said Veselnitskaya “stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Mrs. Clinton. Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.” It was then that the Russian lawyer turned to the “true agenda”—the adoption-related controversy—and he realized “that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting.”

So the meeting was abruptly ended. And Trump Jr. made sure to add that his father knew nothing about it.

Forget any media analysis. The president’s son said he met with a Russian who had promised dirt on Hillary, but was taken in by a “pretext.” That, to put it politely, doesn’t look good. (Don Jr. sees no inconsistency in the accounts.)

Now campaign aides and surrogates often meet with questionable characters in search of oppo research. As Don Jr. tweeted sarcastically, “Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent... went nowherebut had to listen.”

But it’s a different situation if they’re from Russia.

Kellyanne Conway, making the morning TV rounds, argued that the previously undisclosed meeting was a bust: “No information was received that was meaningful or helpful and no action was taken,” she said on “Good Morning America.” She also said Clinton ran such a lousy campaign that the Trump types didn’t have to look far for negative information.

It’s true that the meeting didn’t lead to anything. But it’s also true that Donald Trump Jr. was willing to take the meeting with a Russian lawyer in the hope that she had something hot. And if the White House had disclosed all such meetings months ago, they would no longer be news."

In his opening monologue tonight, Sean Hannity said the Democratic Party is colluding with the mainstream media to undermine the will of the American people and overturn President Donald Trump's election victory.

He pointed out that there has been extensive coverage of Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer, but there has been very little coverage of the fact that Obama administration officials reportedly were the ones who signed off on attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya getting a special waiver to be in the U.S.

He asked if Veselnitskaya was such a threat - as the left and the media are now claiming - then why was she allowed in the U.S. in the first place?

""It sounds like John Kerry, Loretta Lynch and Jeh Johnson all have a lot of explaining to do,"" Hannity said.

""Once again, as we begin to peel back the layers of this onion and learn more and more about truth and facts, this is now boomeranging back onto the Democratic Party,"" he said.

He said that the Democrats and the ""destroy-Trump media"" have ""breathlessly, hysterically"" pushed the Trump-Russia collusion story for months, while they are actually the ones guilty of collusion.

""They have been colluding the entire time, all in an effort to damage, to delegitimize and ultimately overturn an election of you, the American people, and destroy the president,"" Hannity said.

He said the press is largely driven by a left-wing political ideology, as opposed to an honest search for answers and truth.

As for the Democrats, Hannity said they are committed to impeaching Trump, and they will go to any lengths to do so.

President Donald Trump's eldest son changed his account of the meeting he had with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign over the weekend, saying Sunday that Natalia Veselnitskaya told him she had information about Clinton. A statement from Donald Trump Jr. one day earlier made no mention of Clinton.

Asked about the reports, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday the Kremlin does not know who the lawyer is and added that the Kremlin ""cannot keep track"" of every Russian lawyer and their meetings in Russia or abroad."

Jay Sekulow had questioned why the Secret Service allowed Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and others into Trump Tower for the meeting with Donald Trump Jr. in June 2016.

“If this was nefarious, why’d the Secret Service allow these people in?” Sekulow said on ABC’s “This Week.” “The president had Secret Service protection at that point. That raised a question with me.”

But according to the Secret Service, their protection did not extend to the president’s son at that point in the campaign.

“Donald Trump Jr. was not a protectee of the USSS in June 2016,” a USSS official said. “Thus we would not have screened anyone he was meeting with at that time.”

The Secret Service has authorization to protect family members of the president, vice president, president-elect and vice president-elect, along with other individuals in the presidential line of succession. They also are authorized to protect major presidential and vice presidential candidates and their spouses within 120 days of a general election.

Donald Trump Jr. would not have fallen into those categories at that time.

Sekulow, in multiple interviews on Sunday, tried to downplay the controversy over the 2016 meeting, apparently held after an intermediary said a Russian lawyer could have damaging information on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The meeting details have revived allegations of collusion with Russia which the Trump team denies.

The email string carried the subject line, “Russia – Clinton – private and confidential.”

Also attending the meeting with Trump Jr., who has no official role in his father’s administration, were President Trump's then-campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and adviser Jared Kushner.

Trump Jr. initially responded sarcastically to a series of stories about the meeting that appeared in the New York Times, tweeting Monday, “Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent... went nowhere but had to listen.”

On Tuesday he acknowledged on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity” that, looking back, he “probably would have done things a little differently.” He also described the meeting as not memorable, and “literally just a wasted 20 minutes.”

While it is not known who might have leaked details about the meeting to the Times, the Trump White House, which values loyalty, is said to be “angry” and conjecture abounds.

Here’s a look at the key figures in the latest episode to haunt the administration:

Rob Goldstone

This British publicist, an unexpected player, stands at the center of the controversy, having brokered the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya. Goldstone appears to have initiated the conversation, according to what Trump Jr. called the “full email exchange,” which he released on Twitter.

In the emails, Goldstone claims he has contacts who can “provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

Goldstone refers in the emails to “very high level and sensitive information,” claiming the material is “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”

Natalia Veselnitskaya

In arranging the meeting with Trump Jr., Goldstone identified the other participant, presumably Veselnitskaya, as “the Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday.”

In an interview with NBC, however, Veselnitskaya denied any connection to the Russian government. She also contended that she had no damaging information on Clinton, seemingly contradicting claims made in the email exchanges between Goldstone and Trump Jr.

“I never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton. It was never my intention to have that,” Veselnitskaya told NBC.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday that Veselnitskaya is not linked to the Russian government. “We have already said we are absolutely unaware of this story, we have never been in contact with this lawyer,” he said. “She has nothing to do whatsoever with us.""

But the denials have not stopped reports speculating that Veselnitskaya is actually an insider with close ties to Putin.

Paul Manafort

The emails show that Trump Jr. forwarded the messages with Veselnitskaya both to Manafort – Trump’s campaign manager at the time -- and Kushner the day before the meeting.

According to Politico, a source close to Manafort said the former Trump insider “hadn’t read all the way to the bottom of the email exchanges on his phone and that he didn’t even know who he was meeting with when he attended the 20- to 30-minute session.”

On Wednesday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA), whose panel is investigating Trump links to Russia, said he would subpoena Manafort, if necessary, regarding his presence at the June 2016 meeting.

Jared Kushner

Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and the only attendee of June 2016 meeting who formally serves in the Trump administration, has drawn criticism for his involvement. Veselnitskaya claimed that Kushner stayed in the meeting for seven to 10 minutes.

Kushner has come under fire in the past, for not fully disclosing his meetings with foreign government officials properly on a required government security clearance form called SF-86.

Referring to the form, Kushner’s lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, said in a statement, ""Mr. Kushner has submitted additional updates and included, out of an abundance of caution, this meeting with a Russian person, which he briefly attended at the request of his brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr. As Mr. Kushner has consistently stated, he is eager to cooperate and share what he knows.”

Democrats have been quick to call for Kushner’s resignation, and removal of his security clearance.

Vice President Mike Pence

Marc Lotter, press secretary for Vice President Mike Pence, issued a statement Tuesday, saying, “The vice president was not aware of the meeting.”

Pence “is not focused on stories about the campaign, particularly stories about the time before he joined the ticket,” the statement said. Pence was announced as Trump’s pick for vice president via Twitter on July 16, 2016, joining the campaign a month after Trump Jr.’s meeting with Veselnitskaya.

Amid swirling speculation that Pence is “distancing himself” from the “Trump Jr. Scandal,” White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked Tuesday about the relationship between Pence and President Trump.

“There is absolutely no distance between the president and the vice president,” she responded.

President Donald Trump

Trump Jr. has insisted he never informed his father about the Veselnitskaya meeting, telling Sean Hannity, “there was nothing to tell.”

President Trump predictably defended his son, calling him a “high-quality person,” and applauding Trump Jr.’s transparency in releasing the email chain.

Whodunnit?

The question remains: Who might have alerted the New York Times to the existence of this meeting, and the emails?

Guesses from Twitter users range from the Russians, to White House strategist Steve Bannon, to Pence.

Former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone weighed in, telling BuzzFeed that his money is on former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. “Donny was a vocal critic of Corey,” Stone told the website. “He walked him towards the exits, and fits the broad definition of a White House adviser. I’m not unbiased, but he’d be my choice.”

Lewandowski told “Fox & Friends” on Wednesday, “I don’t know who the leaker is, but let me tell you this: If it were up to me, and somebody was speaking to the media, I would fire them on the spot -- and Donald Trump will do the same.”

Stone also posited that intelligence sources could be to blame for the leaks."

In a remarkable denunciation of one of his earliest and most powerful supporters, Trump slammed Sessions' recusal as ""very unfair to the president"" and said he would have never appointed Sessions attorney general if he had known he would do so.

""How do you take a job and then recuse yourself?"" Trump asked rhetorically. ""If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, 'Thanks, Jeff, but I’m not going to take you.'""

There was no immediate comment from Sessions, who announced March 2 that he would recuse himself from overseeing the FBI's investigation into alleged Russian meddling into the 2016 presidential election campaign. Sessions stepped aside after media reports that he had two conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. and failed to disclose them to Congress during his confirmation process.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is overseeing Mueller's investigation. In his interview, Trump told the Times that he had interviewed Mueller to replace the fired James Comey as FBI Director before Rosenstein appointed him special counsel.

He was up here and he wanted the job,” Trump said of Mueller. ""Talk about conflicts. But he was interviewing for the job. There were many other conflicts that I haven’t said, but I will at some point.""

The president lobbed similar conflict of interest charges at Rosenstein and acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. He also accused Comey of briefing him on a dossier of unverified, incriminating information in an effort to gain leverage over the soon-to-be president.

The Justice Department declined to comment on the interview.

Trump also addressed a newly disclosed conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G-20 summit earlier this month. Trump said the pair spoke for about 15 minutes at the dinner and said the conversation consisted of ""pleasantries more than anything else"" — though he said he and Putin also discussed adoption.

Russia had banned Americans from adopting Russian children in response to the Magnitsky Act, passed by Congress in 2012, which allowed the U.S. to impose sanctions on Russians deemed as human rights violators.

It's the same topic Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., says he discussed with a Russian lawyer at a meeting that has drawn intense scrutiny — a coincidence Trump described in the interview as ""interesting.""

According to the Times, the 50-minute interview with Trump took place Wednesday afternoon, following a lunch with Republican senators during which he told them not to go on their August recess until they presented him with a bill repealing ObamaCare.

Goldstone’s name emerged in what Trump Jr. claimed were a series of emails between himself and the publicist, during which Goldstone claimed to have “information that would incriminate Hillary ... and would be very useful to your father.”

Until the emails surfaced, little was widely known about Goldstone, the British-born co-founder and president Oui 2 Entertainment, based in New York City. But his company is said to have represented such stars as Michael Jackson, Quentin Tarantino and Betty White, and counts New York's swanky Russian Tea Room restaurant among its “past and present clients,” according to Oui 2’s Facebook page.

Goldstone's company biography contends he spent several years as a journalist, then founded a publicity company that represented musicians BB King and U2, as well as corporate clients like Richard Branson, before helping launch Oui 2 in 1997.

In 2013, Goldstone began representing pop star Emin Agalarov – known simply as Emin -- the son of Russian real estate tycoon and Miss Universe Moscow collaborator Aras Agalarov.

Trump Jr. told Fox News’ Sean Hannity this week that he first met Goldstone at a golf tournament where Emin was performing.

According to documents that Trump Jr. released via Twitter, Goldstone reached out to the president’s son in 2016, suggesting that Emin had received information from the elder Agalarov regarding Hillary Clinton. That information, according to an email purportedly from Goldstone, was relayed by the office of Russia’s top federal prosecutor. Goldstone added that Emin was apparently interested in sharing the information with the Trump campaign.

But according to Scott Balber, an attorney representing the Agalarovs, “no one approached either Agalarov with information damaging to the Hillary Clinton campaign -- ever. Didn’t happen.” The notion that the Agalarovs possessed details on Clinton, Balber claimed, was a “fantasy” concocted by Goldstone in an effort to please his client, Emin.

Balber confirmed that Emin sought to arrange a meeting with the Trump campaign as a favor to an acquaintance of his, Russian attorney and lobbyist Natalya Veselnitskaya.

The attorney denied that the Agalarovs had anything to gain from arranging the meeting, other than satisfaction from helping a friend.

Meanwhile, Oui 2 is making no secret of its co-founder’s ties to the Trump Jr. story. The company has posted a link on its Facebook page that leads viewers to a report on Goldstone’s “Pivotal Role in the Donald Trump Jr. Scandal.”

The Facebook page is replete with photos of Goldstone wearing silly hats, traveling, and posing with a variety of seemingly well-connected and attractive acquaintances. According to an acquaintance who spoke with the Daily Beast, Goldstone leads a hard-partying, playboy-type lifestyle.

That acquaintance described Goldstone as a “fixture” in a scene back in 2013 that involved young, attractive men and where “an apartment party in a loft on Madison Square Park turned into a limo ride turned into illicit substances in the bathrooms at Boom Boom Room, all of it getting paid for ... somehow.”

Neither Goldstone, his attorney, nor Oui 2 have yet responded to requests for comment."

That former Soviet army officer, Rinat Akhmetshin, appeared before Mueller's grand jury in recent weeks, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Attendees at the 2016 meeting in Trump Tower in New York City included Donald Trump Jr.; the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and President Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.

Emails released by Trump Jr. show he took the meeting expecting to receive damaging information about presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as part of what was described to him as a Russian government effort to aid the Trump campaign.

The revelation, which was first reported in the Financial Times, is the clearest indication yet that Mueller and his team of investigators view the meeting, which came weeks after Trump had secured the Republican presidential nomination, as a relevant inquiry point in their broader probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

“This is obviously very high-level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,” music publicist Rob Goldstone, who helped set up the meeting, wrote in an email to Trump Jr., according to the Hill. He also assured the president’s son that Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who also attended the meeting, had information that “would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful,” to then candidate Trump.

“If it’s what you say I love it especially in the summer,” Trump Jr. replied.

Trump Jr. — who is set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee sometime over the next few weeks — has denied any wrongdoing in taking the meeting.

Akhmetshin, a former Soviet military officer who served in a counterintelligence unit, is also a well-known Washington lobbyist. He has been representing Russian interests trying to undermine the story of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Russian prison and is the namesake of a U.S. sanctions law.

Akhmetshin has been reported to have ties to Russian intelligence but he has denied that, calling the allegations a ""smear campaign.""

Mueller and his team first signaled their interest in the Trump Tower gathering last month by contacting an attorney for at least some of the Russians who attended.

“Firm behind anti-Trump dossier also worked for Russia, Senate witness says,” Trump said in one of two tweets referring to a Fox News story discussed Saturday on “Fox & Friends.”

“In other words, Russia was against Trump in the 2016 Election - and why not, I want strong military & low oil prices. Witch Hunt!,” Trump said in the second tweet.

Rumors about the so-called Trump dossier emerged during the 2016 campaign. The content of the dossier was made public days before Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration but quickly and widely dismissed as nonfactual and a smear effort.

Trump’s presidency has been mired in the Russia controversy and the numerous related investigations.

On Thursday, Bill Browder, chief executive and co-founder of Hermitage Capital, told a Senate panel that the company behind the infamous dossier also worked ""on behalf of the Russian government"" to fight U.S. sanctions that had enraged Moscow's elite.

And he shed new light on the dealings of the controversial company, Fusion GPS.

According to Browder, the company also conducted a ""smear campaign"" against Trump in a bid to fight Russia sanctions.

Browder also testified that the smear campaign was orchestrated by Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian attorney who sought the highly scrutinized Trump Tower meeting last June with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

Browder's testimony skewered Fusion and co-founder Glenn Simpson.

He said the Russian lawyer, working through an intermediary, hired Simpson to ""conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of a congressional hearing on the Global Magnitsky Act.""

Browder had hired the late Sergei Magnitsky to uncover details of massive financial fraud in Russia involving corrupt Russian government officials.

Magnitsky was imprisoned and ultimately beaten to death by Russian officers in Moscow. In the wake of his death, the U.S. passed a law in his name that brought sanctions against Russian oligarchs suspected of money laundering.

Browder described the tactics Simpson allegedly used to discredit him and Magnitsky.

“Glenn Simpson was pitching a story to journalists that Magnitsky had not been murdered, but died of natural causes; that he wasn’t a whistleblower, but a criminal, and that the story I told Congress was incorrect,” Browder said Thursday, adding they were “unsuccessful for the most part” in getting that story written.

Left unclear in Thursday's hearing was what connection there might have been between the Russians and the anti-Trump dossier commissioned by Fusion GPS.

Browder was questioned by multiple senators Thursday on that issue but said he was a “bystander” in regard to the dossier and its crude allegations against Trump, as he had only read reports in the press."

Napolitano', 'A Former Judge Of The Superior Court Of New Jersey', 'Is The Senior Judicial Analyst At Fox News Channel.']",FOX News,"Last week, The New York Times revealed that in June 2016, Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son; Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and chief confidant; Paul Manafort, Trump’s then-campaign chief executive; and others met secretly at Trump Tower with a former Russian prosecutor and a former Soviet counterintelligence agent to discuss what negative (most likely computer-generated) information the Russians might have to offer them about Hillary Clinton.

Within days of the meeting, the elder Trump announced publicly that he would soon release a litany of reasons why Clinton was unqualified to be president and that they would include new allegations about Clinton and Russia. The new allegations did not come.

When the Times reporters asked the younger Trump about the meeting last week, he initially claimed it concerned Americans adopting Russian babies. Then he claimed it was about Russian concerns over American economic sanctions on select Russians. When the reporters told him they had his emails, which tell a different story, he released his emails to the public so as to beat the Times to the punch.

Then, media hell broke loose about whether the Trump campaign was working with the Russians to acquire information about Clinton, and, particularly, whether any Trump campaign officials engaged in criminal behavior.

Here is the backstory:

No seasoned campaign official would have met with foreign people, particularly former government officials, in order to discuss any materials they might have about an opponent, because the acquisition of materials from a foreign person or government is illegal under federal law.

The inquiry that Donald Jr. received from a friend who served as an intermediary between the Trump campaign and the Russians should have been run past the campaign’s legal counsel, who no doubt would have told his colleagues to stay clear of such a proposed meeting, and then reported the overture to the FBI.

Donald Jr. claims that the meeting lasted 20 to 30 minutes and produced nothing of value or of interest to the campaign.

Yet the emails paint a picture of him as hungry for dirt on Hillary (“if it’s what you say I love it,” he wrote), and ready, willing and able to meet with the Russians to see what they had.

Was Donald Jr.’s meeting a criminal act?

Standing alone, the meeting itself was probably not a criminal act. But the varying versions of it that have been given by the president and his son (Were you lying then, or are you lying now?); and the failure of Kushner, who has a national security clearance, to advise the FBI of it in his application for the security clearance (Did you not know they were Russians?); and the presence of an ex-Soviet counterintelligence agent (Did you not know he had been a spy?) at the meeting all give rise to the level of articulable suspicion, which is the constitutional minimum standard to commence a criminal investigation.

In this case -- where the Department of Justice has named a special counsel to examine the role of Russian agents in the 2016 presidential election -- the articulable suspicion standard will surely trigger the special counsel’s involvement.

Stated differently, while the Trump Tower meeting alone was probably not a criminal act because speech unaccompanied by behavior or agreement is absolutely protected by the First Amendment, its existence alone is enough to cause the special counsel to commence a criminal investigation of the participants to determine whether a crime was committed then and there, or elsewhere.

I have been listening for more than a week to many of my respected colleagues asking, “Where is the crime?” and I understand their inquiry.

Yet the crimes for which the special counsel is looking rarely fit into a neat package. Unlike a bank robber who uses a gun to get cash from a bank teller -- a crime that has a beginning and an end -- white-collar crime often involves nuance and mental state and the behavior of third parties sometimes unknown to the original participants.

Thus, an FBI agent or Department of Justice lawyer might compare the Trump Tower meeting to a thief displaying stolen jewelry to a group of potential purchasers, who initially rejected the jewelry. And thus, the feds might want to know whether others decided to view the jewelry, or whether there was a meeting of some of the minds at Trump Tower but perhaps Donald Jr. was excluded from such an assembly. As well, they might inquire as to whether this was an attempt to use foreign people to gather data about Clinton.

We know it is a felony for a campaign official to accept something of value from a foreign national or a foreign government; and we know that because campaigns legally pay folks to do opposition research, that research is a thing of value.

It is a felony for a campaign official to conspire to acquire a thing of value from a foreign national, even if the thing of value never arrives.

It is also a felony for a campaign official to take a material step in furtherance of acquiring a thing of value from a foreign national, even if the thing of value never comes. And it is a felony for anyone without a search warrant to facilitate computer hacking for any purpose.

All this brings us back to Donald Jr.’s meeting. Was it a crime?

We will need to await the outcome of the FBI’s investigation and the DOJ’s presentations to a grand jury. But we do know that the harm to the Trump presidency, much of it caused by those close to the president and the president himself, continues its dark march.

Where will it end?"

“Stock Market hit another all-time high yesterday - despite the Russian hoax story! Also, jobs numbers are starting to look very good!,” Trump tweeted.

The Standard and Poor’s index of 500 large companies with common stock closed Friday at a record high. The Dow has also made significant gains.

The ""hoax story"" has its roots in late 2015 when, according to the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies, Russia used a combination of hacking and disinformation to sabotage the chances of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and boost Trump's.

The investigation has broadended to focus on whether anyone affiliated with Trump’s campaign colluded with Russian officials and on possible obstruction of justice related to Trump's firing of ex-FBI director James Comey.

Russian collusion with Trump's campaign is the focus of several congressional investigations, an FBI probe and the work of the special counsel.

Speculation about collusion has been heightened after revelations that Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. and up to seven other people had a meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016 with a Kremlin-connected lawyer.

The meeting included a discussion about potentially damaging information from the lawyer about Clinton, according to emails released on Twitter by Trump Jr.

Follow Her On Twitter At']",FOX News,"President Trump ripped Hillary Clinton and fellow Democrats Wednesday over what he described as a double standard for their respective associates' alleged coordination with foreign governments in the 2016 campaign.

The president has been on defense over fresh revelations of a meeting his eldest son held last year with a Russian lawyer who promised dirt on Clinton.

But Trump used his widely followed Twitter account Wednesday to draw attention to a Washington Times article claiming Democrats had used false information from Russia to attack him and his campaign.

“@WashTimes states ‘Democrats have willfully used Moscow disinformation to influence the presidential election against Donald Trump,'” the president tweeted.

He added, “Why aren't the same standards placed on the Democrats. Look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with. Disgraceful!”

The news report refers back to the questionable dossier -- written by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele and allegedly distributed by Fusion GPS -- which contained unverified allegations against the Trump team.

Fusion GPS, the Democrat-funded opposition research firm, allegedly paid Steele with money from a Clinton backer. The dossier eventually fell into the hands of the FBI.

The White House and Trump allies also have cited a reported meeting between a DNC consultant and officials at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C., last year.

“If you are looking for an example of a campaign coordinating with a foreign country or a foreign source, look no further than the DNC which actually coordinated opposition research with the Ukrainian Embassy,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday.

“This is not an accusation. That is an on-the-record action that they took,” Sanders said.

The meeting Sanders referred to was first reported in January by Politico. The report cited a meeting between Ukrainian government officials who allegedly tried to help Clinton undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office and shared research and damaging information on Trump and his advisers with Clinton allies.

The Politico investigation exposed that a Ukrainian-American DNC operative -- Alexandra Chalupa, who worked in the Clinton White House -- met with officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump’s then-top campaign official Paul Manafort and Russia. Manafort later resigned.

“Hillary’s staff should not have taken—former Hillary staffers should not have taken the meeting with Ukrainian government,” Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary for President George W. Bush and now a Fox News contributor, said on “Outnumbered” Tuesday.

The Ukrainian Embassy pushed back on Sanders' characterization, saying: “Unfortunately, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee-Sanders must have been misinformed about Ukraine and the DNC.

“The Embassy of Ukraine in Washington did not coordinate with the DNC about opposition research. While some politicians who are not part of the Ukrainian government might have taken sides during last year’s elections in the U.S., the government of Ukraine did not,” the statement said.

Leaders in other countries also spoke out against Trump last year, though not necessarily in any government capacity.

The Washington Examiner reported in May 2016 that former Mexican President Vicente Fox, an ardent Trump critic, met in Mexico with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to discuss ways to boost Clinton. He was not in power, however, at the time.

The back-and-forth comes as the Trump White House tries to control the damage from revelations about Donald Trump Jr.'s June 2016 meeting with the Russian attorney with alleged ties to the Kremlin, Natalia Veselnitskaya.

TRUMP DEFENDS SON AS 'HIGH-QUALITY PERSON,' AS RUSSIA EMAILS FUEL CRITICISM

Trump also posted a defense of his son on Twitter Wednesday morning and attacked the “Fake Media.”

“Remember, when you hear the words ‘sources say’ from the Fake Media, often times those sources are made up and do not exist,” Trump tweeted."

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

SEAN HANNITY, HOST: This is a ""Fox News Alert."" It's great to be back. Welcome to ""Hannity.""

Now, the two big stories we're following tonight, first, the destroy Trump media's Russia psychosis is now back, and it's worse than ever. Also, did James Comey, the former fired FBI director, commit felonies? Tonight, we have a full investigation. Laura Ingraham, Sara Carter, John Solomon, Jay Sekulow, Senator Ted Cruz and Dr. Sebastian Gorka, will all be here tonight.

But first, the mainstream media is once again foaming at the mouth, hysterically obsessing over Russia, Russia, Russia, while, of course, completely ignoring the millions of forgotten men and women in this country. That's the issue they should be focused on. And that is tonight's ""Opening Monologue.""

All right, once again, the destroy Trump media has worked itself into a frenzy over a meeting that Donald Trump, Jr., had back in June of 2016 with a Russian lawyer. Now, the press is running wild, all types of black helicopter tinfoil hat conspiracy theories about Russian collusion once again.

But of course, they are completely missing many of the key facts about this story. And if you actually do some research and read more than the headlines of these phony New York Times reports, well, which is what the media should be doing in the first place, you'll notice some massive holes that are in this story.

Number one, the lawyer who Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner met with didn't work for the Russian government at the time of the meeting. And by the way, as Donald Trump, Jr., said in his statement, quote, ""The woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Mrs. Clinton. Now, her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.""

By the way, she corroborates that. So in other words, the meeting was meaningless, did nothing to produce anything! Where's the collusion? Not to mention, if this lawyer was such a threat and a Russian agent or a spy, then why did the Obama administration let her into this country in 2016?

Now, as John Solomon and Sara Carter reported over the weekend, this lawyer was denied a visa, but eventually was allowed into the country, by the way, under President Obama.

And as President Trump's legal team pointed out, they think that this meeting could have been a setup made to give the appearance of Russian collusion and that the person responsible for orchestrating all of this -- now, pay attention, this is, you're not going to hear this in the mainstream media -- is connected to Fusion GPS. That is the op research firm that produced the fake Christopher Steele dossier -- remember the British spy -- on Donald Trump.

And by the way, as The New York Post has reported, Fusion GPS has several ties to the Democrats, including Clinton allies and even Planned Parenthood. And according to The Washington Times, Christopher Steele said in a court filing that that dossier was never supposed to be made public and that BuzzFeed should never have published it.

So once again, another one of the destroy Trump media's Russia collusion conspiracy theories is falling apart.

And by the way, since everyone is talking about collusion, well, why did the media and Democrats freak out, why did they freak out over a story in January that had real evidence -- and by the way, you won't get this in any other mainstream media outlet, none of them will talk about this! Take a look at the headline from Politico. Quote, ""Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire.""

And according to Politico's report, Ukrainian government officials tried to assist, aid, help Hillary Clinton in several ways by questioning then candidate Donald Trump's fitness for office, by assisting Clinton allies in their op research by putting out documents insinuating that the Ukrainian government was investigating a top Trump aide. And the report adds that a DNC operative even met with Ukrainian officials at the Ukrainian embassy in D.C. to discuss ways to expose former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and ties to the country.

Oh, they went to the Ukrainians, an outside entity, another country! Well, where's the outrage over this? How many of you even heard about this before? Because there's actual evidence of collusion. The meetings actually took place. The research actually happened. That's collusion! And by the way, where was Congress calling for investigations?

And also tonight, there's another example that does expose the destroy Trump media and the Democrats' real agenda. And by the way, on top of all of this, another massive scandal the Democrats and the media are glossing over.

According to an explosive new report from John Solomon -- he'll join us later -- the former FBI Director James Comey tonight could be in serious legal trouble and have committed several felonies because four of the seven memos about his conversations with President Trump did, in fact, contain classified information.

Now, we know from Comey's testimony that he shared at least one of the memos with his friend. Remember the Columbia professor who leaked it to the New York Times on his behalf because he wanted a special counsel. And he wanted that to lead to the appointment of a special counsel, which, by the way, it did.

And according to the same report, the FBI considers the memos that Comey made -- well, they happen to be government property, typed on a government computer in a government car, not personal documents, which is how Comey described them under oath. And of course, tonight, Comey's friend is denying that the memos that he was given contained classified information at the time he received them. How would he know? He's also denying, by the way, giving the press the actual memos. Really?

So what it all boils down to, what we're now living through is a massive, huge double standard, selective moral outrage. Now, we know real felonies, real crimes were committed, again, things the mainstream media will not report or tell you if it doesn't have the word Russia in it. Hillary Clinton mishandled and destroyed top-secret classified special program information, government information. But the media, the Democrats? Oh, that's not a big deal.

Clinton as secretary of state gave, handed up to 20 percent of America's uranium -- you want to talk about a Russia conspiracy? -- to Vladimir Putin and the Russians. And the people involved in that deal kicked back over $100 million to the Clinton Foundation. And by the way, Bill Clinton doubled his speaking fees in Moscow. Where I grew up from, that's called bribery, pay-to-play.

And of course, we got the former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. And Lynch, by the way, also pressured James Comey to call the investigation into Clinton's server -- ""don't call it investigation, call it a matter,"" which is what the Clinton campaign wanted. You know, who cares about possible obstruction of justice in that case, right?

And of course, we have the deep state. What have they been doing? Selectively leaking and unmasking raw intelligence to a corrupt media! The deep state leaks are so bad that a recent Senate report found that they were happening at a rate of one a day through the end of May -- in other words, 125 leaks at least in 126 days, seven times more than the previous two administrations. But nothing there, right?

Now, Comey leaks government documents to the media. Do they care? Not at all. Democrats, members of the destroy Trump media have now for months been lying, smearing, slandering, trying to delegitimize the president, stop him from doing his job. But that's just what they do. We shouldn't care, right?

It just shows just how abusively biased, agenda-driven these so-called rigid, radical left-wing ideologues are. They are doing a disservice to you, the American people. They are purposely ignoring the real scandals that now exist, real crimes committed, real collusion that occurs. They hate this president so much and want him to fail, they'll do anything they can to get him thrown out of office.

You got the Democrats, you got CNN, The New York Times, you got NBC, The Washington Post -- they don't give a rip about the president's agenda! They'll do anything they can to stop it. And more importantly, at the bottom of that, on the foundation of that, they don't care about the millions and millions of forgotten men, forgotten women that this last election was about. It's all about me, me, me in the media. It's all about their Russia obsession in the media. It's all about their left-wing ideological agenda.

So I was on vacation last week. I try to gain perspective when I'm away. This is what I have concluded and the state of the country as we are today. The media, the deep state, the Democrats, the never Trumpers and frankly, lazy, spineless Republicans -- they are not giving a rip about enacting President Trump's agenda and they're working hard to stop it.

And by the way, who's impacted by that? The hard-working men and women that make this country great every day. Guess what? These people are showing no respect to the American people and their decision. No desire do they have in the media, all these groups, to get the country moving in a direction that will help every person that went to the polls in November.

To the media, to all these groups, the deep state, Democrats, weak Republicans it's all a big game of gotcha. They try to take down the president. They lie. They use innuendo, selective moral outrage. Any mention of the word Russia, they go over the cliff and they're foaming at the mouth.

So before we continue, I want to remind you, the American people, what this country needs to get done and sooner rather than later and what the media needs to focus on, even though they never will. You can never trust them.

The border wall needs to be funded so we can protect the American people. ObamaCare -- let's see, it's been promised by Republicans in 2010, 2014, 2016 and now they're saying they're not sure they can get it done? Well, maybe they should be done, if they can't.

We need to stop -- look at the situation in North Korea, a clear and present danger to the entire world, of course, thanks to Bill Clinton's 1990s bribes to the rogue regime and then being played. And of course, they got the nuclear weapons that Clinton promised they'd never get. And now you got a lunatic, Kim Jong-un. Now he's seeking ICBM capability. And we got Iran. Well, of course now, we can never allow them to get nuclear weapons despite the billions Obama gave them and the right to continue to spin their centrifuges.

We need to get the economy going. We need to get Americans back to work, Americans off of food stamps, Americans out of poverty, Americans buying homes. And you know what? All of this is so important, but all they want to talk about is Russia, Russia, Russia.

You, the American people, the people that went to the polls in November, the forgotten men and women that have been left behind -- you're now caught in a crossfire, an ideological crossfire. The groups we've been telling you about, the destroy Trump media, the obstructionist Democrats, the deep state, never-Trumpers, lazy Republicans are all doing this because they don't like how you voted! They think they know better.

And that's why tonight, we have to call out the Republican lawmakers. They have asked for this job and they're now failing. They are part of the problem. They need to cancel their August recess, stay, working like the rest of America in Washington to fulfill the promises they made to all of us here. If you people can't get health care done, get the wall funded, the economy moving, a new budget plan passed, you are failing the American people!

The president has been in office since January doing everything he can do on his own. It's time you in the House and Senate get to work! Stop with the vacations! If you have to work 14 hours a day, seven days a week like most Americans, do it!

It's time to end the excuses, find a way to get it done because you owe the American people. You gave your word! In other words, do your job! That's what you were hired for. You're supposed to be public servants. Do what the American people sent you to D.C. for!

Here with reaction tonight, FOX News contributor Laura Ingraham. All right, Laura. This is, like, pent up. By the way, thanks for filling in.

LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: We missed you.

HANNITY: What's that?

INGRAHAM: We missed you.

HANNITY: No...

(CROSSTALK)

HANNITY: You were here. So you did a great job holding down the fort. I am...

INGRAHAM: (INAUDIBLE)

HANNITY: This is pent-up fury that is building in me! I can't take it!

INGRAHAM: Well, you're right. And I think when you get away, for just a - - even a -- even a few days where you can think and you're not bombarded 24/7 with politics -- you actually talk to real people who have real lives that are separate from Washington and the Washington and New York axis, and you find out what's on their mind.

And we have the opportunity to do that on radio every day because we talk to people three hours a day, five days a week. But somehow, when you get to decompress a little bit, it all does settle in.

And it is stunning, number one, that we have Republicans who refuse to produce results for the Trump agenda that won a historic election. That's outrageous.

And number two is, of course, the media who you rightly called deranged for their obsession with issues that most Americans think -- you know, they're important, but they're not everything. And you can't focus 24/7 on those issues to the exclusion of health care and economic recovery and the good things that have already occurred under the Trump administration.

So you're right to be frustrated. I think Americans are extremely upset and enraged that Mitch McConnell cannot deliver a bill to the president's desk that he can sign. That's -- I mean, I don't see how you can keep your job as Senate majority leader...

HANNITY: They don't deserve to!

(CROSSTALK)

INGRAHAM: They certainly don't. No, and not -- you wouldn't -- you wouldn't be able to keep your job in corporate America with this track record. And six months into this almost, five-and-a-half months into this administration, they should have already delivered on tax cuts, on infrastructure, and clearly on repealing ""Obama care"" and replacing it with something that's much more market-based that will bring down the cost of health care, all things that you've talked about.

This is what the folks want. They refuse to do it. Looks like we're going to have to get Republicans who can actually deliver what the voters want.

HANNITY: I -- I -- the idea that they have, like, less than -- like, about 30 days left in the legislative calendar in the next six months -- who -- do you even have -- do you have time to eat lunch? I don't -- you know what I eat for lunch?

INGRAHAM: No, not usually.

HANNITY: Campbell's soup every day. These people take...

(CROSSTALK)

(LAUGHTER)

HANNITY: I've never seen anything like it!

INGRAHAM: In the make-up room, I just had a couple of oatmeal cookies that Debbie (ph), the make-up lady, has.

HANNITY: Yes, Green Room food...

INGRAHAM: That was my lunch.

HANNITY: ... which is the worst!

INGRAHAM: Yes, exactly. No, we don't have time to do much of that. But they do have -- you know, I got to say I've been to the Senate dining room a few times because there are actually a few senators who are trying to get things done. So I've been there a few times, and it's always packed. I mean, they're -- they always have time to eat lunch over at the Senate dining room. So they're -- they're -- they're feeding themselves quite well.

I think we have to hold them accountable. Look at what the left is doing, Sean. They're mobilizing the resistance. Elizabeth Warren's putting out the call to mobilize against the Republicans in this critical week, two- week period. And what are the Republican voters doing? They're scratching their heads because they say, We already -- we already told you what we want. We voted for Donald Trump. We told you what to do. You refuse to do it. That's unconscionable. It's unconscionable.

HANNITY: All right, coming up, Sara Carter, John Solomon, Jay Sekulow join us with reaction to the big breaking news today.

And then later, it's time to hold these Washington Republicans accountable. Senator Ted Cruz -- he thinks they should stay home from vacation. He'll update us on the Senate's attempt to repeal and replace ""Obama care,"" all that, Dr. Sebastian Gorka.

And wait until you see the final minute, a new segment tonight. Terrence Williams (ph) gets the last word. We'll explain coming up.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Former fired FBI director James Comey is in deep trouble tonight just weeks after testifying under oath that the memos that he wrote and then later leaked about his conversations with President Trump were not government records and contained no classified information.

There's this bombshell from John Solomon that reveals more than half the memos the former FBI director, James Comey, wrote as personal recollections of his conversations with President Trump about the Russia investigation have, in fact, been determined to contain classified information, according to interviews with officials familiar with the documents.

Also tonight, there's another explosive new story from John Solomon and Sara Carter regarding the meeting between Donald Trump, Jr., and a Russian lawyer that's sending the media into a feeding frenzy yet again. Could it have been set up by Democratic operatives? You won't catch this on the other news channels.

Joining us now, Circa News Sara Carter, the executive vice president at The Hill, John Solomon, the attorney for President Trump, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice Jay Sekulow.

Let's start, Jay, with you on the issue of 18 U.S. code 641, the Records Act, government property leaked to The New York Times, 18 U.S. Code 793, the Espionage Act, classified information. Are they both felonies?

JAY SEKULOW, TRUMP LEGAL TEAM: Yes. They -- both -- one is -- 793 is always a felony, 641 can be a felony. And (INAUDIBLE) this case, my position would be that it would be.

But let's be really clear what happened here. So James Comey -- we now know, by the way, he didn't just leak one memo but four that he sent to this law professor. The law professor's acknowledged he got it. Just the authorized disclosure in and of itself would be a violation of the law, and in my view, a felony.

So let's take it a step further. We -- it was done -- and James Comey testified to two things. One, he said it was his personal notes. The government's obviously taking a very different view. They're saying it is government property.

Number two, he leaked that information for one purpose only, and that was to obtain a special counsel, which he did. So now let's put this into context. James Comey illegally leaked government information to a third party, ultimately to The New York Times, for one purpose, and that was to get a special counsel. So the special counsel was put in place based on documents that were illegally leaked. Everything's wrong with that picture. That is not the way it's supposed to be.

HANNITY: All right, Sara Carter, let's go to you and your reporting along with John. Good have you both back, by the way. Let's start with your reports about was this possibly a setup? In other words, this whole meeting with Donald Trump, Jr. -- is this a very different story than the American people are being told?

SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS: Yes, I think there's a story here that people aren't getting from the mainstream media. And one is this. Natalia Veselnitskaya -- she was the attorney that Donald Trump, Jr., met with -- was actually connected to a company called Presevan (ph) Holding, which was run by a Russian named Dennis Katzik (ph). And Dennis Katzik (ph) actually hired Fusion GPS.

Remember, this was the security investigative firm behind the Christopher Steele dossier. So the Christopher Steele dossier, which has been disreputable, which people have not been able to prove anything, that tried to connect, you know, Donald Trump to the Russians, was actually the company that this woman was working for.

So it makes sense. And I know that congressional investigators are looking into this. What was her connection to Fusion GPS? And how does that play out with the meeting that she held with Donald Trump, Jr., which he said he did not know prior to that meeting exactly who she was and what she was representing. So that is a very, very important part of this story.

HANNITY: And John, I want to juxtapose this to another story that Politico broke. And this goes back in January of this past year. And the headline is, ""Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire."" ""Kiev officials are scrambling to make amends with the president-elect after quietly working to boost Clinton."" Now, the story goes on to talk about that this wasn't the only campaign that was boosted by a former Soviet bloc country. And Ukrainian officials, government officials tried to help Hillary undermine Trump, questioning his fitness for office and also discussing documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption, and so on and so forth.

Is that coupled with this dossier that was put together -- are those two examples of foreign governments working with the Clinton campaign to influence the outcome of an election?

JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL: You know, that's a great question. We don't know who else. We've only heard about Russia, Russia, Russia, but many other countries had an interest in this election, and we don't know who they helped or what they did to help.

I think the most important question to answer today is who allowed that Russian lawyer into the United States? She was denied a visa. We were able to report that on Sunday. That means someone had to give her special permission. It's called parole entry. And when we find out what agency let her in, we're going to know who's responsible for getting her in the country and putting her in the position to meet with Donald Trump, Jr.

HANNITY: Well, don't we know that in was the Obama administration, John?

SOLOMON: There's no doubt it was in the Obama administration. It occurred in 2015 and 2016. Now the question is what agency is responsible? Could it be the FBI, the Justice Department? Those are questions we need to answer.

HANNITY: Do you believe that this was a setup by the DNC and this Fusion group that we're are talking about?

SOLOMON: You know, there's not enough facts and evidence to assume that yet. I think there is clearly a lot of people that were working at once, and what overlays they have and what intersections they have, we don't know in part because Fusion GPS hasn't answered a lot of the questions that the Senate has put to them. Until we find out who was funding the dossier, until we find out who brought Natalia into the country, until we learn those sort of questions, we're not going to know the full picture, and I think it's too soon to make any assumptions.

HANNITY: We're going to have more with Sara, John, Jay right after the break.

Also, Senator Ted Cruz is here tonight. He says failure is not an option when it comes to repealing, replacing ""Obama care."" He'll explain what he wants this bill to look like.

And also later tonight...

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But hey, Sean, let's talk about fake news. We all know who that is, CNN. They are so messy, petty and trifling! They are the phony baloney macaroni news.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: Our friend, he's on conservative media. He's a comedian. We're going to give him the last word tonight. We'll play his hilarious video coming up later. All that, Dr. Gorka is here, as we continue.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KELLY WRIGHT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's news headquarters I'm Kelly Wright. Good evening. Here's what's happening.

The president's eldest son might find himself on the congressional hot seat. The Senate Intelligence Committee's top Democrat says he, quote, absolutely wants to hear from Donald Trump Jr. about a meeting he had last year with the Russian lawyer. Virginia Senator Mark Warner calls it the first clear evidence of senior level members of the Trump campaign meeting with Russians. It was reportedly arranged to obtain damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. says he will be happy to work with the Senate committee.

And word out of eastern Mississippi tonight of a deadly military plane crash in Missouri. The Marine refueling plane went down in a rural area with nine people on board. At least five deaths are confirmed. Dense terrain and powerful explosives from the wreckage are hampering the search for possible survivors.

I am Kelly Wright. Now back to ""Hannity.""

HANNITY: As we continue tonight on ""Hannity"" with reaction to all this breaking news out of Washington, we continue with Sara Carter, John Solomon, Jay Sekulow. Sara, I will go with you. OK, this is what we do know. We know 125 deep state leaks in 126 days. This is what we know -- James Comey violated the Records and the Espionage Act. Here we know Hillary Clinton mishandled classified information, top-secret information, special access program information, and she also destroyed some of those. Then of course the uranium one deal, pay to play, quid pro quo, where I grew up it's called bribery, and she got all of this money kicked back to the Clinton Foundation, and Vladimir Putin, Russia conspiracy, up to 20 percent of America's uranium reserves.

These are all issues, crimes -- General Flynn is another -- we know they were committed here. There's nobody talking about any of these issues. And then the Ukrainian influence that I mentioned in the last segment. How is it possible, Russia, Russia, Russia, and all this other stuff getting ignored?

SARA CARTER, REPORTER, ""CIRCA NEWS"": I don't think it's necessarily being ignored anymore, Sean. We don't know what the FBI is doing now. We know that the mainstream media is not reporting it. But remember, these cases were never actually really closed, were they? The Clinton Foundation and other issues related to the Clinton Foundation, so we don't know what the FBI is looking at now.

What we do know is that they are all these pieces of evidence laid out and that those pieces of evidence are going to start unraveling. And right, Russia, Russia, Russia when it comes to Trump but go all the way back. But go all the way back. The Obama administration did to their due diligence to investigate Russia. We know that the Russians have been meddling since the 1960s. There is no surprise here. And even what happened to Donald Trump, Jr., that's no surprise. I think John brought up a great point -- who let Natalia in, we will get answers.

HANNITY: Would any other presidential campaign, John Heilemann tweeted out today, oh, I've never heard about this before. I'm like, just read ""Politico"" in January of 2017 about the Ukrainians working with the Clinton campaign. There's your collusion. Or just read about the dossier guy and there's more collusion. John Solomon, same question. All the crimes we know were committed here.

JOHN SOLOMON, REPORTER, ""CIRCA NEWS"": I've covered about five or six presidential campaign, and every campaign someone walks into a Republican and Democratic campaign claiming to have information, and campaigns meet with them. Sometimes they act on it, sometimes, in this case it appears they didn't act on it. But the truth of the matter is this is part of the normal process of the dirty political system that we live in today. And I don't think there's anything particularly remarkable that someone might walk into Trump Tower offering dirt on the Hillary Clinton. You would expect that to happen in the middle of an election.

HANNITY: It always happens. And if anyone says it doesn't, it's a lie. And we know it happened with Hillary's campaign, and the DNC actually was working with these people. Jay Sekulow, let me put up on the side of the screen lost potentially broken by James Comey, and I think some of these laws are the very same laws he let Hillary off the hook with, especially the Espionage Act, apply to her.

JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: This is -- you talk about a double standard. And he said she was careless, extremely careless. By the way, it's the standard for gross negligence with the unsecured server situation. But you look at the law and you look at the facts and this is not hard to put together.

So the question now is, what is going to be done with regard to James Comey? Here's what should be happening. First of all, the Department of Justice needs to investigate James Comey. There should be a grand jury empaneled and he should be investigated. Let's understand what he did. He had a conversation -- several now. We know he leaked at least four memos. He had a series of conversations with the president of the United States. He went to his government computer, put them into a memo form, put them in his government desk for when he needed them after he gets fired, and then releases them. Now he says of course during his testimony this was his own private recollection recorded. The government is saying no, it's not. It's government property. Those are crimes.

HANNITY: Thank you all for being with us. We will conversation all week. We are going to dig deeper. We're going to point out the hypocrisy and tell you how the media has an agenda that's not to help you, the American people. Thanks for being with us.

And coming up on this program, we are holding Washington accountable. It is time for Republicans to work and to keep their promises. Senator Ted Cruz will join us next.

And also later tonight --

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: Terrence Williams, a conservative comic that is a social media sensation gets the last word on HANNITY tonight as we continue.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Now as I said at the top of the show tonight, Republican lawmakers, they need to cancel their August recess, roll up their sleeves, start working on the president's agenda. Their lack of urgency frankly is pathetic. It's also time Republicans keep the promises they made, especially on repealing and replacing Obamacare.

Over the weekend Senator Ted Cruz said failure is not an option, and that he believes that health care can in fact get done. He joins us now from Washington, D.C., and that is Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Senator, I am with you. I'm listening to McCain and McConnell, they are basically throwing up their arms. What's happening here?

SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: Sean, look, I think some people are frustrated. But I continue to believe we can get this done and we have to get it done. For seven years Republicans have promised the voters if you elect thus, the one thing we said is we will repeal Obamacare. I think it would be catastrophic if we failed to deliver on that promise.

And so what I am spending every waking moment doing right now is trying to bring together and unify Republicans, trying to bring together conservatives and moderates and leadership and the administration, get everyone on the same page and say let's deliver on the promise. When it comes to Obamacare, the most important thing, Sean, the way we unify Republicans is let's focus on lowering premiums. The biggest reason so many millions of people are so unhappy with Obamacare and hurting so badly is that it's made premiums skyrocket. If we come together, enact common sense reforms, more competition, more choices, more options, and we lower premiums, that's a win for everyone. That's how we get this done.

HANNITY: Senator, I know that you work very close because I talked to all the Freedom Caucus guys, and you are literally up late at night talking to all the House Freedom Caucus members, all the disparate groups there, to try to get it done in a way that would also work in the Senate. So I am really surprised -- not by you but by other senators saying we are not going to get this done. That was the House's promise in 2010. You had a filibuster in 2013. They said oh, that's going to hurt the elections in the Senate in 2014 -- wrong. Republicans won the Senate in 2014. Donald Trump is now the president. How does anybody in the Republican Party expect to get reelected if they can't do this one fundamental thing that they all promised?

CRUZ: You are absolutely right. And I think the voters would naturally say to heck with all of you if we can't get our act together and get it done.

As I said, the way to do it is to focus on lowering premiums. And I think there are three big tools for doing that. Number one is allowing people to use health savings accounts to pay health insurance premiums. They can't do that right now. That's a big, big deal because it lets you use pretax dollars, which means for a lot of taxpayers, the cost of their premiums drop 20-30 percent instantly. That is now in the Senate bill. I wrote that provision last week. It was added to the Senate bill. That's a big improvement. It's making the Senate bill better.

The second big piece, and really the knob of the battle right now is the consumer freedom option. The consumer freedom option is an amendment I've written that says you, the consumer, you have the right to choose what health insurance you want to buy. It says if a health insurance company sells at least one plan consistent with the title one mandates, that it can also sell any other plan consumers want.

HANNITY: Yes, I love that.

CRUZ: What that does is it gives everybody more choices. And Sean, this was designed to be a compromise that conservatives and moderates could come together, because you are not taking away anything. For people that want all the bells and whistles, all the mandates, the full Cadillac plan, those are still offered. All it does is add new and additional plans, new options to drive down costs. I'll tell you, the president, the vice president, the administration are strongly supporting the consumer freedom option. And I think it's really the key to bringing us together.

HANNITY: Last question. I know the Freedom Caucus in the House, and a group of senators tonight put out a letter to Mitch McConnell -- because you only have 30 legislative days left in the year, for crying out loud. So in 15 days you're scheduled to go on vacation again. I don't think most Americans can identify with this. I suspect you don't want to go on vacation, but I didn't see your name on the list. Is there a reason?

CRUZ: It's crazy that we would be taking a recess. There are a bunch of us, myself included, that have been urging leadership back from January, let's not take any recesses. Let's work every day. Let's work weekends. Let's work till we get the job done. And the people that are pushing for that are the folks elected in the last five, six years, what I call the Young Turks that have consistently pressing, saying we have got a job to do and we have a short window of time. And so we ought to stop taking recesses, stop taking time off and just keep going until we get it done.

HANNITY: Well said.

CRUZ: The particular letter you mentioned, I was in Obamacare negotiation so I didn't get a chance to sign the letter, but I very much agree with the sentiment that we need to stay here and do our job and get it done.

HANNITY: All right, Senator, you're right. If these guys fail, they will pay a price so large that they seem to have no clue about what the backlash will be. They better get their job done. Senator Cruz, keep us in the loop on this, very important. We appreciate it.

And coming up, President Trump while in Warsaw last week showed the world what leading from the front actually looks like. America needs this now more than ever. Up next, we get reaction, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, and Terrence Williams gets the final word tonight. You don't want to miss it.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: We will never forget who we are. And if we don't forget who we are, we just can't be beaten. The west became great not because of paperwork and regulations but because people were allowed to chase their dreams and pursue their destinies. Our borders will always be closed to terrorism and extremism of any kind.

The west will never, ever be broken. Our values will prevail. Our people will thrive and our civilization will triumph.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: President Trump last week in Warsaw in Poland, showing the world that leading from the front, it looks a lot better. By the way, it couldn't come at a more important time. Here with reaction, deputy assistant to the president, Dr. Sebastian Gorka. Dr. Gorka, I am on vacation and then I'm watching the latest phony Russia conspiracy theory now being advanced. And thousands of hours of coverage, and I'm looking at North Korea, they have nuclear weapons because of the Clintons. And the Iranians are trying to get them and they have the money because of Obama.

And then I am looking at ISIS is not defeated. And then I'm thinking, OK, our borders are not secure. Our economy, our bills to pass the economy, that's not been done. There's no coverage of any of this because of the obsessive-compulsive desire to stop the president's agenda. To me, these are real clear present dangers to the world. How do you take out North Korea's nuclear sites and do it effectively when they have nuclear weapons that could hit Seoul and Japan and even China if the guys that nuts?

DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: You are absolutely right, Sean. The Russia story should be called a hoax. Nine months and nothing? Absolutely nothing? They are desperate now with the story about the president's son. On the contrary, if they wanted to find about Russian influence in American politics, look at John Podesta's company. Look at the uranium deal when Hillary was secretary of state. In the meantime, what about the real story --

HANNITY: The uranium deal or the Uranium One deal?

GORKA: Uranium One, uranium deal, yes, absolutely.

In the meantime, let's look at what the media should be reporting if they weren't politically motivated. In the last 24 weeks, it's stunning. Look about the decrease in illegal migration. Look at what we've done with regards to NATO. You at what happened today. Mosul, Mosul has been liberated. Think about that. We have been in office for less than six months and the caliphate of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, which was created in part thanks to President Obama's withdrawal in 2011 from Iraq, we have only been in office for less than six months and thanks to the president's leadership, we are winning everywhere, but you wouldn't know it if you turned on CNN or read ""The New York Times.""

HANNITY: Baghdadi, we have an author on who said in fact they had a chance to take Baghdadi out, but because of Obama rules of engagement they didn't take the shot. They had two weeks to do it.

GORKA: When it comes to rules of engagement, that's another massive story that isn't being reported. I've had tier one operators from our special operations forces tell me, I've had commanders, they felt it in the first three weeks after the inauguration. The shackles were off. The president trusts them. He wants them to do the job they were trained to do. Look at what we are doing. We are stacking the bad guys like cordwood. And that's what we need to do because the threat is real. And we don't want to see those bad guys come to the streets of America as we have seen in Europe.

HANNITY: God forbid the media get off their Russia obsession. Maybe they should focus on Hillary and her campaign working with the Ukrainians directly, proven, no ambiguity, collusion. They don't report. Dr. Gorka, good to see you, thank you.

And up next, you do not want to miss our next segment on ""Hannity.""

Follow Her On Twitter']",FOX News,"President Trump and the Kremlin have denied allegations that Russia and the Trump campaign colluded in the 2016 presidential election – but the probe into suspicions of Russian meddling forged ahead, culminating on Friday, March 22, when Special Counsel Robert Mueller submitted his long-awaited report to Attorney General Bill Barr.

Barr, in a four-page letter on Sunday, March 24, revealed the ""principal conclusions"" Mueller and his team reached following the nearly two-year-long investigation. The investigation ultimately ""did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated"" with Russians who worked on those hacking efforts ""despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.""

Mueller was appointed to investigate potential wrongdoing more than one year ago, and his team subsequently brought multiple charges against people associated with the presidential campaign.

Read on for a breakdown of the Russia investigation and what it means for the administration.

What exactly was being investigated?

Multiple investigators were looking into just how broad the scope of Russia’s involvement in the 2016 presidential election was and if the foreign nation had any interaction with the Trump campaign.

Investigators were also looking at the financial ties between some Trump associates and the Kremlin.

Who was in charge of the investigations?

Multiple congressional committees launched probes into Russia’s attempts to influence the election.

The Department of Justice appointed Robert Mueller as its special counsel overseeing its investigation in May 2017. He was appointed after Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was the first Republican senator to endorse Trump, recused himself from the investigation. Mueller's appointment also followed a growing Democratic outcry for someone outside the Justice Department to handle the probe.

The House Intelligence Committee released its heavily redacted final report of its investigation in April 2018, which said there was ""no evidence"" of collusion.

Was anyone charged?

Mueller’s investigation led to multiple charges – although none were directly related to misconduct from the campaign.

In his leading role, Mueller took over an ongoing investigation into Paul Manafort's financial dealings in Ukraine. In August 2018, Manafort was convicted of eight bank and tax fraud charges, becoming the first campaign associate of Trump's to be found guilty by a jury.

A month later, Manafort pleaded guilty in a second case as part of an agreement with Mueller's team. The plea deal reportedly includes a 10-year cap for how long Manafort will be in prison. It also includes allowing Manafort to serve his time for both trials concurrently.

Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, and Richard Gates were first indicted in October 2017 on multiple counts, including conspiracy against the U.S., conspiracy to launder money, false statements and failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts. Manafort and Gates initially pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Gates pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy and false-statements charges on Feb. 23. After the plea, Mueller moved to drop the 22 bank and tax fraud charges against Gates.

Manafort joined Trump’s campaign ahead of the Republican National Convention to help wrangle delegates before becoming the campaign chairman. He resigned in August 2016.

Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was also charged in connection with Mueller’s probe. Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to one charge of lying to the FBI – reportedly about his talks with a Russian ambassador.

Flynn was Trump’s national security adviser for a short time, but his connection to the White House was rife with controversy that still bedevils the administration. Flynn resigned after less than a month in the position.

At issue was his contact with Moscow's ambassador to Washington. Flynn and the Russian appear to have discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia late in 2016, raising questions about whether he was freelancing on foreign policy while former President Barack Obama was still in office and whether he misled Trump officials about the communications.

Additionally, George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to Trump’s campaign, pleaded guilty in 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his connections with Russian officials. He was later sentenced to 14 days in prison, 13 months of supervised release, 200 hours of community service and a $9,500 fine.

During his time on the campaign, Papadopoulos attempted to set up meetings between campaign officials and Russians on numerous occasions. He also interacted with a professor “understood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials” who told Papadopoulos that the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, according to court documents.

Alex van der Zwaan, an attorney, pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about Gates in the Russia inquiry. In April 2018, he was sentenced to 30 days in prison, making him the first to be sentenced in the investigation. He was released from prison on June 4 and turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.

Richard Pinedo, a California man who sold bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election, pleaded guilty in February 2018 to using stolen identities to set up the accounts. The U.S. government said Pinedo was not aware he was dealing with Russians when he sold the accounts. He was sentenced to six months in prison and six months to home confinement in October.

A federal grand jury also indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities for allegedly interfering in the election. Mueller’s case alleges those involved had a sophisticated plot to wage “information warfare” on the U.S.

Additionally, the Justice Department on July 13 announced 12 Russian intelligence officers were indicted for allegedly hacking the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign during the 2016 election. All 12 are members of GRU, the Russian intelligence agency.

Did anyone else on Trump’s team have connections to Russians or the investigation?

Donald Trump Jr., the president’s oldest son, got the administration into some hot water when it was revealed that he took a meeting with a Russian lawyer during the campaign who was supposed to have damning information about Clinton.

“This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,” an email about the meeting said in part.

Trump Jr. maintained that the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, did not have any information to share and instead wanted to discuss the Magnitsky Act and other sanctions.

Manafort and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, were also at the meeting.

Kushner, too, has been under FBI scrutiny. Married to Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, Kushner may possess substantial information relevant to the investigation, officials have said.

Although he has denied colluding with Russians or knowing of anyone who did, Kushner has had private meetings with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss the controversial encounter with Veselnitskya, which occurred in the summer of 2016. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have accused him of not being forthcoming in the information divulged.

Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House chief strategist, agreed to meet with Mueller as part of his investigation, potentially avoiding appearing under subpoena in front of a grand jury. Sessions and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have already met with Mueller, becoming the highest-ranking administration officials known thus far to have submitted to questioning.

An attorney for the Trump Organization, made up of hundreds of companies owned by Trump through a trust and managed by his two sons, told The Associated Press that it had been “fully cooperative” with Mueller’s probe. The company turned over documents to investigators.

What about Trump?

Trump had said he was “looking forward” to being questioned by Mueller under oath regarding the investigation. Aside from his associates’ connections to Russians, the president has also found himself under scrutiny for certain actions while in office.

Trump sacked FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017 – less than two months after Comey publicly proclaimed the agency was investigating ties between Russia and Trump’s campaign.

The White House maintained Comey was let go due to his handling of an investigation into Clinton’s private email server used during her tenure as secretary of state. But Trump has suggested that he considered the Russian investigation when he fired Comey.

Comey told a Senate intelligence committee Trump had asked for the FBI to drop its investigation into Flynn; the White House said Trump was not attempting to influence his FBI director.

After Comey’s dismissal, Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador at the time, where he shared classified information regarding ISIS threats, the Washington Post reported.

The Trump administration sanctioned 19 Russian individuals and five Russian entities on March 15 for allegedly interfering in the 2016 election and engaging in cyber-attacks. The Treasury Department announced the sanctions, which included the 13 Russians who were already indicted in Mueller’s probe.

Why was the investigation controversial?

Trump has been critical of Mueller, calling his friendship with Comey “very bothersome.” Multiple investigators on Mueller’s team face questions about their potential biases – and two were reassigned from the probe.

House Republicans released a memo in early February 2018 that detailed alleged surveillance abuses used in the Russia probe.

The memo, put together by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., did “raise concerns with the legitimacy and legality of certain DOJ and FBI interactions with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and represent a troubling breakdown of legal processes established to protect the American people from abuses related to the FISA process,” it said.

Trump said the memo “vindicates” him in the Russia investigation.

But Democrats dismissed the memo as ""misleading,"" saying it was released by Republicans in order to push the narrative that the probe is biased against the president. Weeks later, they released their own rebuttal memo, which defended the FBI and Justice Department.

How did the Russian meddling allegations even begin?

Before Trump took office, tens of thousands of emails from the Democratic National Committee and officials connected to Clinton were leaked.

Those emails – released in July 2016 – purportedly showed the party favoring Clinton over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and led to the resignation of party chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

But more than just ousting Wasserman Schultz, intelligence officials concluded those responsible for leaking the emails were connected to the Russian government. In its assessment of the hack, the CIA concluded that Russia intervened in the election in order to help Trump secure the presidency.

The Russian lawyer who has been thrust into the spotlight following reports of her meeting with President Donald Trump's eldest son was a largely unknown figure until she began to represent the son of a Russian official in a major money-laundering trial.

Natalia Veselnitskaya's name has not been linked to government officials, the pro-Kremlin political party or major pro-Kremlin NGOs. The law firm where she is listed as managing partner, Kamerton Consulting, is based in a Moscow suburb and does not even have a website. A staff member at Kamerton told The Associated Press Veselnitskaya was unavailable for comment on Monday.

A New York Times story over the weekend cited advisers to the White House as saying that Donald Trump Jr., Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort had a meeting in June last year with Veselnitskaya, who promised damaging information about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Trump Jr. said in a statement on Sunday that he had agreed to the meeting after he was told the lawyer might have information that would be ""helpful"" to the Trump campaign. He said she claimed during the discussion to have information that ""individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee"" and supporting Clinton but said ""it quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that the Kremlin is unaware of a meeting between Trump's senior staff and Veselnitskaya and ""does not know who that is.""

Veselnitskaya does not appear to have handled any major clients in Russia until she got involved in a case defending Denis Katsyv, the son of a vice-president of state-owned Russian Railways who was slapped with money-laundering charges in the United States tied to a massive Russian tax-fraud scheme.

The case against Katsyv's company, Prevezon, was settled in New York in May for some $6 million, three days before it was to go to trial. The U.S. Attorney's office portrayed the settlement as a win for its anti-corruption efforts while Prevezon insisted that the settlement demonstrated that there was no wrongdoing on its behalf.

Investigators had suspected that Cyprus-registered Prevezon bought upscale New York City real estate with some of the proceeds from a $230 million Russian tax-fraud scheme brought to light by a Russian lawyer who later died in prison.

Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer for investment advisory Hermitage Capital, accused officials of stealing the money via tax rebates. The official Russian probe into his death in a Moscow prison in 2009 insisted that he suffered a heart attack, but Russia's presidential council on human rights found that Magnitsky was beaten and denied medical treatment.

The United States passed the Magnitsky Act in 2012 that imposed sanctions on five Russian officials involved in alleged human rights violations in the Magnitsky case.

Veselnitskaya, who represented Katsyv in Russia, in an interview with the Russian daily Kommersant last year denied that her client had any connections to the tax-fraud scheme. She insisted that the case against Katsyv's company was based on ""anonymous papers and documents of dubious character"" that Hermitage Capital's owner, Bill Browder, had shared with American investigators.

""The Prevezon case and the Magnitsky Act are based on the same lie that Bill Browder has been selling to those who want to demonize Russia and its leaders,"" she said.

Veselnitskaya has also been involved in promoting a film by a Russian director that disputed the fact that Magnitsky uncovered the tax fraud or that he was beaten in jail. Its screening at the European Parliament in Brussels last year was canceled at the last moment, and human rights activists involved in the investigation of Magnitsky's death dismissed it as an attempt to whitewash torture.

The day the settlement in the Prevezon case was announced Veselnitskya said in a Facebook post that her team appreciated ""the initiative by the U.S. government to settle this insane case.""

Glenn Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who helped found Fusion GPS in 2010, was asked to appear at a scheduled July 19 hearing about the role of foreign lobbying in last year's presidential election.

However, Politico, citing two sources, reported that Simpson did not plan to testify. The report added that it was not immediately clear whether the committee planned to compel Simpson to testify. By contrast, The Washington Times reported Thursday that Simpson would testify before the panel.

During the campaign, Fusion GPS contracted former MI-6 agent Christopher Steele to build a report on Trump's financial and social connections in Russia. The dossier included a number of sordid allegations about Trump's sexual proclivities, which the president has repeatedly denied.

On Wednesday, Fox News reported that Fusion GPS had ties to Russian efforts to undermine U.S. sanctions that were led by attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya. Veselnitskaya was at the center of a political storm earlier this week after Donald Trump Jr. made public emails indicating that he had taken a meeting with Veselnitskaya on the promise of receiving damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

Investment manager Bill Browder has alleged that Simpson was retained by Veselnitskaya's client, Prevezon Holdings, as part of an effort to repeal the Magnitsky Act, named for Sergei Magnitsky — an attorney who was beaten to death in a Moscow prison after accusing Russian authorities of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars through tax refunds and then laundering the money through New York banks.

Browder, a former Magnitsky client, told Fox News that Simpson was ""using all of his media contacts to get a smear campaign going against Magnitsky and myself. He also seems to be able to get articles stopped. Simpson has unusual influence because he was often a big source to these reporters on other stories.”

Browder has also claimed that ""Veselnitskaya probably tried 12 different angles to get to Trump and also to Clinton for that matter"" and said she had ""every possible incentive to get to both sides” since her goal was to get the Magnitsky Act repealed, and apparently not to influence the U.S. election.""

In a statement, Fusion said it had nothing to do with the Trump Jr. meeting.

“Fusion GPS learned about this meeting from news reports and had no prior knowledge of it. Any claim that Fusion GPS arranged or facilitated this meeting in any way is absolutely false,” the statement read."

Follow Her On Twitter At']",FOX News,"The head of the firm behind the infamous anti-Trump dossier was interviewed for hours behind closed doors Tuesday on Capitol Hill, sources confirmed to Fox News.

Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of investigative firm Fusion GPS, met with staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee as part of the committee’s investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with the Trump campaign in the 2016 presidential election.

A committee spokesperson did not give Fox News any further information on the meeting with Simpson and Judiciary staff, though a source confirmed that Fusion GPS has given the Senate committee over 40,000 documents.

""Mr. Simpson told Congress the truth and cleared the

record on many matters of interest to congressional investigators,"" his attorney Josh Levy told Fox News.

Simpson's company was behind the dossier that was compiled during last year's campaign and which contained crude allegations against now-President Trump.

Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and committee Ranking Member Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., originally had issued a subpoena for Simpson’s testimony at a public hearing before the committee last month. But they withdrew it after Simpson reached arrangements to interview with the committee in private.

RUSSIA PROBE: DEMOCRATS BLOCK KEY WITNESS AGAINST SHADOWY FIRM FUSION GPS

The committee’s hearing in July pertained to oversight of the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). At the public session, CEO and founder of Hermitage Capital Bill Browder testified that Fusion GPS and Simpson worked “on behalf of the Russian government” in an effort to fight U.S. sanctions that had enraged Moscow’s elite.

Browder told lawmakers that Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who met with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower in June 2016, also was responsible for hiring Simpson to “conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of a congressional hearing on the Global Magnitsky Act.” The Magnitsky Act is a U.S. law that brings sanctions against Russian oligarchs suspected of money laundering.

FIRM BEHIND ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER ALSO WORKED FOR RUSSIA, SENATE WITNESS SAYS

After the hearing, Fusion GPS responded to Browder’s allegations -- saying they had “complied with the law” and were “not required to register under FARA,” and “did not spread false information about William Browder or Sergei Magnitsky.”

“What is clear is that the president and his allies are desperately trying to smear Fusion GPS because it investigated Donald Trump’s ties to Russia,” Fusion GPS said in a statement to Fox News last month. “They have pulled out all the stops, including this false allegation about FARA.”"

And they are in full gloating mode.

Having been stunned that Donald Trump beat their candidate—along with most of the media—they are quite publicly relishing the latest twist in the Russia investigation and the uproar over the president’s son.

Now it’s hardly shocking, with Democrats controlling nothing in Washington, that the opposition would want something to cheer about.

But what’s fascinating is the snarky and taunting tone that some of them are taking on Twitter. Having dealt with them over the years, they were generally measured and cautious when they were in top government and campaign positions.

They are exuding an aura of vindication after months of talking about Russian interference in the election, sometimes spiking the digital football.

Now of course it’s Twitter, and they’re out of office, so they’ve got plenty of latitude. And the president, with his wrestling-video approach, has been known to play rough on Twitter.

But there’s a real finger-in-the-eye quality to many of these tweets. One might even say they are trolling the Trump White House.

Not all the Democrats are playing this way. David Axelrod and Josh Earnest, for example, tend to be more balanced in their commentary.

Brian Fallon, who was Clinton’s chief campaign spokesman, reveled in the news about Trump Jr. having met with a Russian lawyer who he was told had anti-Hillary oppo:



Turning his attention to Jared Kushner: “It's about the son-in-law, stupid.”

And Fallon dragged in a criminal case involving Kushner’s father, who has nothing to do with this: “Jared giving up bro-in-law wld be pretty mean. OTOH Jared's dad went to jail for setting up his bro-in-law w/hooker.” Now who’s sounding mean?

Jennifer Palmieri, who was Clinton’s communications director, did a serious tweetstorm on the Don Jr. story:

She also seized on the role of Rob Goldstone, the heavyset British publicist who brokered the Don Jr. meeting, linking to a campaign debate when Trump said the hacking might not have been done by Russians but by some random obese guy:

“Think we've found Trump's mythic 400 lb hacker: Goldstone!”

Dan Pfeiffer, who was Obama’s communications chief and later counselor, took shots at the House speaker and Fox News:

“Donald Trump Jr may have arranged the meeting, but let's not forget Kushner broke the law when he lied about it on his security form.” Kushner amended the form after numeorus omissions.

Pfeiffer also mocked the president’s penchant for battling the media:

Tommy Vietor, former spokesman for Obama’s National Security Council, is the most sarcastic:

Vietor even dragged a notorious murder defendant into his criticism:

Last week it was John Podesta, the former Clinton campaign chairman, who unloaded on Trump, calling him “our whack job POTUS” and telling him to “get a grip man.” But that was different, for Podesta was responding to Trump calling him “disgraceful” and saying from the G-20 summit that he had failed to turn over the DNC server to the FBI. Podesta didn’t work for the DNC.

It may be that Twitter is prime ground not just for potshots but for venting. The former Democratic officials often seem to be commiserating and clowning with their liberal compatriots. They sure don’t sound like they’re trying to persuade folks who might be more favorably disposed toward the president."

Michelle Malkin said that Russian President Vladimir Putin would have benefited much more from a Hillary Clinton presidency than from the current administration.

""Putin would have benefited far greater from an America that was weaker, that de-emphasized its military, and that did not believe in its sovereignty the way that our president does,"" Malkin told ""Fox & Friends.""

""He wants what's good for Russia and I want what's good for the United States,"" President Trump told Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network.

""Why would he want me [to win]?"" Trump said of Putin, adding that Hillary would have ""decimated"" the U.S. military, which would have been helpful to Russia.

Her comments come as fresh accusations swirl that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the presidential election. Reports this week that Donald Jr., the president's son met in Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer in hopes of obtaining damaging information on Clinton from Russian government sources raised eyebrows.

The meeting was a dud, and the lawyer had no ""meaningful information"" to offer, Donald Jr. said.

The Clinton Foundation is essentially a ""special interest and influence-peddling foundation and cash machine for around the world,"" Malkin said, adding that Putin would have been happy to have that at his disposal.

Malkin said she was curious about what those in homeland security and intelligence think are the ""biggest ... existential threats"" to the nation, such as jihad or North Korea that may pose much greater threats than the Russia collusion theories.

""It raises the question of all of the selective outrage that the media has about foreign meddling,"" she concluded.

Their scheduled meetings is the last development in numerous investigations into the extent to which Russian officials meddled in last year’s race an whether Trump associates colluded with them.

And as investigations continue, Trump on Saturday added to the speculation that he’ll try to end them or protect himself and associates by stating that he has ""complete power"" to issue pardons.

""While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us. FAKE NEWS,"" the president tweeted Saturday morning.

The comment follows a recent Washington Post story stating Trump has inquired about the authority he has as president to pardon aides in connection with the investigations -- including several on Capitol Hill and separate ones by the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller.

Trump maintains that no crimes have been committed and has urged authorities to prosecute those who have leaked information about the probes.

On Sunday, new White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci acknowledged that Trump indeed “brought (pardons) up” in the Oval Office but said the president doesn’t need to pardon himself.

“And the reason doesn't need to pardon himself is that he hasn't done anything wrong,” Scaramucci told “Fox News Sunday.”

On Saturday night, Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's attorneys, said the president has not discussed the issue of pardons with his outside legal team.

Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son; Kushner, Trump son-in-law and a White House adviser; and former Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort are scheduled to appear before Senate committees investigating Russian meddling.

Kushner is set to speak Monday to the Senate Intelligence committee in an expected closed-door meeting.

Trump Jr. became a focus of the investigations after it was revealed that he, Kushner and Manafort met with Russian representatives at Trump Tower in June 2016.

He later released email exchanges concerning the meeting on Twitter, after learning that The New York Times was about to publish them.

Trump defended his son in another tweet Saturday, saying he ""openly gave his e-mails to the media & authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (& acid washed) her 33,000 e-mails!""

This week has the potential to deliver the most high-profile congressional testimony involving the Russian meddling probes since former FBI Director James Comey appeared in June.

Trump Jr. is scheduled to appear Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee along with Manafort, according to a witness list released by the panel.

The three men will almost certainly be asked about their attendance at a June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer. That gathering was arranged via emails that advertised it would reveal damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

The lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, said last week that she was ready to testify before the Senate and ""clarify the situation.""

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence panel, has said Veselnitskaya has yet to be invited to testify but that he wants to hear from her.

Warner said ""it's still being worked out"" whether some of his committee's more high-profile witnesses, including Trump Jr. and Manafort, should testify publicly or privately.

The Senate and House intelligence panels conduct most of their interviews in private, but occasionally hold open hearings.

Warner said Trump Jr. has ""no security clearances that I am aware of, so he should be able to testify in public.""

Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary panel, said last week that he's been talking to Trump Jr.'s lawyer and ""didn't get any pushback"" when suggesting he testify this week.

Grassley had said he would subpoena the witnesses if necessary.

A statement released Friday by the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee said the arrangement means the panel no longer needs to subpoena Donald Trump Jr. and former campaign manager Paul Manafort for Wednesday's hearing. But the commitee suggests it might invite Trump Jr. and Manafort to appear at a future public hearing.

“Both Donald Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort, through their attorneys, have agreed to negotiate to provide the committee with documents and be interviewed by committee members and staff prior to a public hearing,” the statement from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said. “Therefore, we will not issue subpoenas for them tonight requiring their presence at Wednesday’s hearing but reserve the right to do so in the future.”

Both Trump Jr. and Manafort were invited to testify at the committee's July 26 hearing. The committee suggested it would subpoena them if they didn't voluntarily testify.

Feinstein tweeted Friday afternoon, “The Judiciary Committee will talk to Trump Jr. & Manafort before they testify in public, but we will get answers.”

Both Trump Jr. and Manafort have come under scrutiny following revelations that they attended a June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian attorney and at least five other people.

The Trump administration has denied any wrongdoing in connection with Russia.

According to emails released by Trump Jr., the prospect of potentially damaging information about 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was touted as a reason for the meaning. But Trump Jr. later said the focus of the meeting turned to Russian adoptions.

Meanwhile, President Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, who also attended the meeting in Trump Tower, is scheduled to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday and the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, in connection with their Russia probes."

LEAST SURPRISING FAILURE EVER

How can anybody act surprised that legislation loved by none, despised by most and championed half-heartedly as a bitter necessity failed?

The demise of the second iteration of the Senate Republicans’ proposed cuts to ObamaCare was about as surprising – and about as comfortable – as the sticky, mid-July heat on the banks of the Potomac.

We will not waste your time fully recapitulating why this was almost inevitable, but there were advantages for both conservatives and moderates in seeing this legislation fail and moving a step closer to the all-but-certain standalone effort to prop up the individual insurance market for next year.

Before they get on to that, though, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he will exact a price from his recalcitrant members, both moderate and conservative.

McConnell said today that he is still going to hold a vote, but now on the Obama-era version in which the government would repeal the law in its entirety but forestall implementation for two years while a replacement program is devised.

Moderate members are already waving off this idea, even some who voted for it when it was just veto bait for the former president, pointing out that times had changed.

Making them vote against it now will be embarrassing for them. But it will also be quite painful for conservatives. Here’s why: Conservatives will be tempted to vote against the replacement because they know it’s a procedural move that would allow the bill to be revived and then overhauled again through the amendment process.

You shouldn’t have to care too much about the arcana of Senate procedures, but take our word for it when we tell you that McConnell is playing hardball here.

A word also about the whole concept of repeal then replace: This was the approach of Republicans not only during the Obama-era but was, essentially, the first plan put forward by House Speaker Paul Ryan in the new Republican-controlled Washington.

If you will recall, President Trump joined the conservatives in denouncing this approach as a potential bait-and-switch. Republican leaders responded with a plan to concurrently repeal and replace the law, but no one liked it.

That legislation eventually staggered out of the House like a drunk out of a bar at closing time, but found that there were no cabs running at that hour.

Over in the Senate, lawmakers tried the same approach but found even less willingness. At about that point, conservatives, including some of those who had denounced Ryan’s original plan, suddenly clamored for repeal then replace. And again, Trump joined them.

And so, Republicans find themselves all the way back at the beginning, but now rather than fresh and full of legislative optimism, start over with bruised and mistrustful of one another.

There is much debate about who is to blame. The short answer is everyone. But on the question of whether it is Republican lawmakers or the president who are mostly responsible for this debacle, the weight of judgment has to fall ever so slightly on the professionals.

Trump has made it clear he will sign just about anything that could be viewed through squinted eyes as some kind of repeal-and-replace legislation. He has made no secret of the fact that he is mostly indifferent to policy at this point. You can’t fault Republican lawmakers for being afraid of crossing Trump, who is famous for his wrath and vendettas. But, it still seems like a little bit more legislative brio was in order here.

But, of course, lawmakers could not know in March that by July Trump would be in his current weakened condition. With a mix of optimism and anxiety, they probably thought he might be popular and on offense even now.

Trump’s proposed remedy for the legislative failure is to change the rules of the Senate to make passing legislation easier. He has called for the same thing before, but now seems to be implying that he is going to push harder to lower the 60-vote threshold in the upper chamber.

The idea here is that while it would be difficult to find 50 votes for the rule change – especially since McConnell is opposed to the idea – but that if Trump could threaten, cajole and entice all but two members of the Senate on ObamaCare repeal, the rest of his agenda would pass “nice and easy.”

Here’s what that would look like: Trump would campaign in person and deploy his political apparatus against senators who resisted the rule change, including McConnell himself. It would be total war against his own party, and still provide no sure hope for victory. It would require a disciplined, focused message from the president and the White House, to be rolled out almost immediately and sustained over a period of weeks.

Perhaps if Trump had threatened such a thing in the weeks after his inauguration the threat would have proven credible. But at this point, senators know better. It’s safe to assume this will all get very ugly, but it’s not unreasonable to think that the White House can now be successfully defied.

So what’s the likely outcome here? The same as it has been since early in the process. Faced with coverage disruptions for many of the 12 million individual policy holders covered through ObamaCare exchanges, Republicans will have to go to Democrats to ask for help to prop up ObameCare for one more year.

THE RULEBOOK: UNDER CONTROL

“It is therefore evident, that one national government would be able, at much less expense, to extend the duties on imports, beyond comparison, further than would be practicable to the States separately, or to any partial confederacies.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 12

TIME OUT: ENOUGH TO FILL THE ALBERT HALL?

NatGeo: “Trypophobia might be one of the Internet's most talked about phobias that you haven't heard of by name. The term is Greek for ‘boring holes’—trypo—and ‘fear’—phobia—and amounts to a fear of clusters of small holes. … The term is not recognized by the American Psychiatric Association, and mental health experts debate whether or not the affliction is a true phobia, with some opting more frequently to label it an idiosyncrasy, or unusual behavior. … A new study from the University of Kent published in the journal Cognition and Emotion puts forth another theory for why some people have such strong negative reactions to little clusters of holes. ‘It's pretty well known that disgust helps us avoid infectious diseases and pathogens,’ said Tom Kupfer, the study's author. … In other words, people who fear the sight of small clusters of holes could be feeling anxiety about parasites or disease that can easily spread from person to person.”

TRUMP RECERTIFIES IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL

NYT: “President Trump agreed on Monday to certify again that Iran is complying with an international nuclear agreement that he has strongly criticized, but only after hours of arguing with his top national security advisers, briefly upending a planned announcement as a legal deadline loomed. Mr. Trump has repeatedly condemned the deal brokered by President Barack Obama as a dangerous capitulation to Iran, but six months into his presidency he has not abandoned it. The decision on Monday was the second time his administration certified Iran’s compliance, and aides said a frustrated Mr. Trump had told his security team that he would not keep doing so indefinitely. Administration officials announced the certification on Monday evening while emphasizing that they intended to toughen enforcement of the deal, apply new sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism and other destabilizing activities, and negotiate with European partners to craft a broader strategy to increase pressure on Tehran.”

ANTI-IMMIGRATION GROUP FUMES OVER TRUMP VISA BUMP

USA Today: “Despite President Trump’s vow to put American workers first, the administration on Monday announced that it will allow an additional 15,000 low-wage, seasonal workers into the United States during the remainder of the fiscal year. The H-2B visas are designed for non-agricultural workers for jobs in a variety of businesses, including fisheries, construction, hotels, restaurants and resorts. The Trump Organization is among the firms that use the visas, including workers at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. The United States grants up to 33,000 such visas every six months, meaning the additional visas will provide a 45% increase for the second half of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. … ‘This is yet another example of the administration and Congress failing to keep the Trump campaign promise of putting American workers first,’ [Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, a group that advocates for lower levels of immigration] said.”

There is no money in the current federal budget for wall construction on the site. But federal engineers are preparing on the basis that Congress could approve funding for the 2018 budget year, the official said.”

HOUSE GOP UNVEILS BUDGET PLAN

WaPo: “House Republicans unveiled a 2018 budget plan Tuesday that would pave the way for ambitious tax reform legislation — but only alongside a package of politically sensitive spending cuts that threaten to derail the tax rewrite before it begins. GOP infighting over spending, health care and other matters continues to cast doubt on whether the budget blueprint can survive a House vote. Failing to pass a budget could complicate leaders’ plans to move on to their next governing priority as hopes of a health-care overhaul appeared to collapse late Monday in the Senate. The House Budget Committee blueprint, which is set for a Thursday committee vote, sets out special procedures that could ultimately allow Republicans to pass legislation over the objections of Senate Democrats who can normally block bills they oppose. GOP leaders in the House, as well as top Trump administration officials, hope to use those procedures — known as reconciliation — to pass a tax overhaul later this year.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Chris, Re: the quote below from your Halftime Report [Monday]: How many Americans will lose their coverage if the GOP does not pass a new bill? Just wondering. ‘An earlier estimate from the independent number-crunching agency determined that 22 million Americans would lose health care in the next 10 years and premiums and out-of-pocket expenses would sharply increase for low-income people and those nearing retirement.’” – Lily Zahrt, Mill Valley, Calif.



[Ed. note: As we discussed above, Ms. Zahrt, the area of concern under ObamaCare as currently constituted is in the 12 million or so people who purchase individual policies through the law’s exchanges. The rest of America’s health insurance system is, relatively speaking, running fine. No one knows how many people would be unable to afford insurance if insurance companies aren’t subsidized to induce them to write policies that would otherwise be unprofitable. The difference, of course, is that those consequences would be immediate.

“Americans knowingly elected a president that insisted on keeping his tax returns secret and now many among them express surprise and dismay that he continues to try and keep his actions private forcing him to change his stories as new revelations emerge. Why all the righteous indignation? What did they expect? I can't remember who said that in a democracy you get what you deserve. I do not fault Trump for being who he is; he has never tried to hide it. I fault today's education system for not creating an electorate that can see the implications therein.” – Barbara Flanagan, Gardnerville, Nev.

THEY CALL HIM BOB

The [UK] Telegraph: “It probably wasn't what the proud makers of this robot had in mind when they promised to build a machine that could replace human security guards. An autonomous security robot designed to patrol car parks and buildings appears to have taken its life into its own hands by driving into a fountain in an office building in Washington DC. … But this particular robot, for reasons as yet not known, appears to have driven down the steps of the fountain in the middle of the office and ended up floating sideways, rendering it immobile. It was removed, although is likely to have been permanently damaged. Knightscope, the company behind the droid, said it was investigating the incident and that it was an isolated event. But that didn't stop people drawing comparisons to Marvin, the paranoid robot from The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy series, and speculating that things might have just become too much for the K5.”

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

MARTHA MACCALLUM, ""THE STORY"" HOST: The White House goes on offense; the president goes to France. And Senator's struggle towards a potential deal on health care tonight. Good evening, everybody, I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is ""The Story."" The president on the ground in Paris, in meetings with President Macron, had this to say about the meeting that is being called a smoking gun.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer, but a Russian lawyer. It was a short meeting. I think from a practical standpoint, most people would've taken that meeting. It's called opposition research or even research into your opponent. That's new standard in politics, but nothing happened from the meeting; zero happened from the meeting. And honestly, I think the press made a very big deal over something that, really, a lot of people would do. Now, the lawyer that went to the meeting, I say that she was in the halls of Congress, also. And somebody said that her visa or her passport to come into the country was approved by Attorney General Lynch.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MACCALLUM: And here is former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a short time ago, making this argument on the Russia question. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER MANAGER, TRUMP CAMPAIGN: If anybody, and I mean, anybody, did something with a foreign government that materially impacted the outcome of this election, that person should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. I spent 18 months next to the president's side, seven days a week, 18 hours a day, never, and I mean never, did he raise the issue of Russia to me.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MACCALLUM: Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge, live on this story for us in Washington tonight. Catherine.

CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Martha, these court records and transcript reviewed by Fox News show the Russian lawyer at the center of the Donald Trump Jr. e-mails was granted special immigration status by the Obama administration Justice Department, as first reported by the Helm Newspaper. Natalia Veselnitskaya was the lawyer for a Russian businessman accused by federal prosecutors of laundering hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate transactions.

The government's bypass the normal visa process and gave a type of extraordinary permission to enter the country called ""immigration parole."" The document states that the discretionary act of the statute allows the attorney general to do in extraordinary circumstances. The Attorney General at the time of the court filing is 2015, 2016, was Loretta Lynch. Democrat said tonight, Republicans may be overplaying the connection.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SIMON ROSENBERG, FOUNDER, NEW DEMOCRAT NETWORK: Clearly, someone in the United States government had to make an exception. And what we've learned, or what is been reported, is that that was granted in order to allow her to come to the United States to defend her client in a major international trial in New York. That seems like a reasonable use of the parole option.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HERRIDGE: After the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and then Campaign Chairman, Paul Manafort, Natalia Veselnitskaya heads to Capitol Hill where she can be seen in the background of this video at House Foreign Affairs Committee. It's not clear from our reporting tonight what her immigration or parole status was at that time, Martha.

MACCALLUM: Catherine, thank you very much. Catherine Herridge, in Washington.

HERRIDGE: You're welcome.

MACCALLUM: So, here with more: March Thiessen, former chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush; and Juan Williams, co-host of ""The Five,"" both, of course, are Fox News contributors. Gentlemen, welcome, good to have both of you with us tonight. Marc, let me start with you in D.C. You know, there's now all of this speculation about this woman and want her connection is. She apparently worked with Fusion GPS on some of the investigation to this election related matters as well. You know, it's possible that, perhaps, somebody wanted her to be in this country. You know, you can go down that road if you want to, and no doubt people are going to be investigating all sides of this.

MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER CHIEF SPEECHWRITER FOR PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: No, absolutely. And look, I mean, Trump was, factually, correct when he said that Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer who is not a government lawyer. That is a fact. However, it's deeply misleading because Donald Trump Jr. thought he was meeting with the Russian government lawyer. If you read the e-mail that he was sent; according to the e-mails, he was asked to meet with ""a Russian attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this purpose on Thursday,"" and that the crown prosecutor has offered to provide the Trump campaign with official documents that were part of Russia's government support for Mr. Trump. And he said, ""I love it,"" and he took the meeting. Now, was that a crime? No, it's not a crime according to most lawyers that I've said, that I've talked to; I read and respect on this subject. But it is collusion. And the Trump campaign has been saying for a long time that there was no collusion. We now know that Donald Trump and Paul Manafort --

MACCALLUM: It's an attempted collusion, but it doesn't prove that any collusion actually happened.

THIESSEN: This is what we know, OK, that Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner were aware that the Russian government wanted to help the Trump campaign and hurt Hillary Clinton, and that they were willing to accept that help. That is a problem. It's not smoking gun, there's not a crime here yet, but it's no longer you can't just dismiss this as a witch hunt. This is serious stuff.

MACCALLUM: Juan.

JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND HOST: I think Marc's right. I just -- you know it's interesting to me to hear the president talk about this because when they bring up the whole business of, oh, the Obama administration let this lawyer in the country; it's not our fault.

That's not the issue. The issue is that Donald Trump Jr. decided to take a meeting with this woman based on the e-mails as just described to by Marc, that indicated he was meeting with a lawyer --

MACCALLUM: So, the question that they're getting is: was he set up? OK. Now, no one -- I don't think anyone disputes the premise of what Marc just said, which is that it was really unwise to take this meeting and it looks terrible. And I don't think anybody disagrees with that part of the equation. The part that's raised by why she was allowed under this statute to stay in the country, that was in January when she was working on that case. She's still here in June, according to this timeline.

WILLIAMS: Correct.

MACCALLUM: She's also, apparently, involved in this Fusion GPS, you know, company. They had some relationship. They're the people who were trying to do the dossier on Trump to Christopher Steele. So, you know, you can kind of let your (INAUDIBLE) plot, you know, go along here with this, and ask yourself what is this woman up to? Is she setting him up? Is she trying to get him in the room to do -- it's like some sort of sting operation?

WILLIAMS: Well, wait a second. I mean, it's not that you would think that it was Fusion, and a Steele report on Trump, and Russia, and all that. It's more that we know that the Russians co-opt people --

MACCALLUM: Absolutely.

WILLIAMS: And that this is their strategy. This is the way they buy into people and the way that they confide in people and get them to suddenly the offering information. That's the danger here.

MACCALLUM: Yes. And there's a piece, Marc Thiessen, by David French that says, if you think ever that you're going to sort of play with the Russians and that you were going to come out of it with what you want and that they're not going to get something too, you're sadly mistaken.

THIESSEN: No, David French is exactly right on that. And I agree with Juan that this could very well have been some sort of a set up to get some sort of -- to compromise Donald Trump Jr. or some members of the campaign.

MACCALLUM: That he fell for.

THIESSEN: That he fell for. Now, look, there's a lot of people running around saying this is treason, that this is impeachable; we're way, way, way -- they're getting way ahead of their skis on this stuff. The name on the e-mail is Donald Trump Jr., not Donald Trump. And there's no evidence yet that Donald Trump knew about this, that he was in the meeting. But we also don't know whether he knew about this. We don't know what came of this later or whether there was more discussion. And we don't know if Donald Trump Jr. told his father that there's a Russian prosecutor coming over to give us information about Hillary Clinton. We just don't know any of that. So, this is why Bob Mueller has to get to the bottom of this, to get around the speculation.



WILLIAMS: I would just say that Donald Trump Jr., to be fair to him, said to Sean Hannity earlier this week that he didn't tell his dad. The problem is it's hard to believe that Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner, the son-in- law, his brother-in-law, are in this meeting and somehow nobody mentioned to the Principal, oh, yes, you know, we had a meeting with a Russian lawyer who said she had information from the crown prosecutor in Russia. That seems alarming to me. I don't know. The fact that the campaign managers in the meeting suggested it was a high-level meeting.

MACCALLUM: Seems odd. All right, more to come, stay tuned. Thank you, guys. Good to see you both. So, some conservatives are starting to lash out over this Don Jr. news. The New York Post editorial board declaring this: ""Donald Trump Jr. is an idiot."" David French, who we just mentioned of the National Review writing this: ""Americans who aren't troubled, are Americans who need to check whether their tribalism has trumped their good sense.""

And Quin Hillyer of the Washington Examiner writes this: ""For Trump's three most politically important associates/family members to be so blinkered as to not recognize this meeting invitation as being morally compromising is for them to bring serious dishonor to a candidate and father with any sense of honor."" Strong stuff.

So, here now to respond is former Speaker of the House and Author of the number one New York Times' best-selling book: ""Understanding Trump,"" Newt Gingrich. Newt, you've been listening to all of this tonight. What do you think?

NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND AUTHOR: I think we're going through a period of fevered insanity. You have a meeting -- first of all, somebody suggested the Russians have a technique of setting you up so that they co-opt you. Well, if that was true in this meeting, I've written three novels about terrorism and international spies. If they were setting them up, where were the goodies? Where was something in there to be --?

MACCALLUM: Well, the suggestion, Newt, is that the goody is what we're living through right now. The goodie is that he took the meeting and that there didn't even need to be anything that was transmitted in that meeting, that taking it made him look bad.

GINGRICH: But wait a second. Taking it makes them look bad. He agrees to that. He said the other night on Hannity that if he had to do it over again, he'd do it very differently. But looking bad, and having a United States Senator suggest that it's treason, is such an absurd jump. And I want to go back to what I started with. People are saying, oh, gosh, this is how the Russians operate. That's baloney. If this had been a set up by the Soviets or by the Russians, they would've had something there to get a second meeting, to get to a third meeting.

I think it's much more likely what you had, were e-mails, by the way, from a British publicist for a Russian singer. And the e-mails in British publicist exaggerated the woman who walked in the room. She walked in the room, and she had so little to offer that none of the three people thought the meeting made any sense. And that's precisely what they've said. That, you know, Jared walks out. Apparently, Manafort is on his cell phone, and Donald Jr. has said, as a courtesy, he talked to her for 20 minutes, but she wants to talk about this adoption bill that affects one very wealthy Russian.

My own point is if, after nine months, all of these hearings, all of these investigations, the best we can come up with is a 20-minute meeting with a lawyer who had nothing to say. There's zero -- by contrast, we do know that a Democratic National Committeeperson flew to Ukraine, worked with the Ukrainian government, sought to get information about Donald Trump. And by the way, what about Paul Manafort? And by the way, I don't see Mueller putting that on his list of investigations. I don't see that kind of collusion has seemingly bothered anybody. So, you have a totally one- sided, anti-Trump story, hyped up with a level hysteria that, I think, historians will look back on, and think, this was like the Salem witchcraft trials. They've created a fever in which people, certain things that are silly.

MACCALLUM: If you sort of go backward on it, and you're looking for, you know, where is the actual event that, apparently, turns the election, right? And all you have are the e-mails, right?

GINGRICH: There is no event.

MACCALLUM: Now, even if you believe, you know, the Hillary Clinton version, which is that she lost because of the e-mails, and there are a lot of other reasons, you know, with regard to health care premiums that were rising, and no, you know, campaign trips to various key states. But she has said that the e-mails turned the election. Now, we still -- there's no connection, necessarily, that goes back to the Trump campaign in releasing those e-mails. Now, if that were to surface, you know, perhaps you might have a link something, but we still don't have the meat between the pieces of bread here.

GINGRICH: Look, it's not even that. Let's put it in context. Do you want to talk e-mails? How about the 33,000 e-mails that Hillary Clinton destroyed? OK? Now, how come that's not a crime? How about the fact that Comey leaked the documents that belong to the FBI in clear contravention of FBI rules? How come that's not a big problem? I mean, let's just go down the list. How come Bill Clinton is getting a half million dollars from a Moscow bank? That's not a problem. How about the fact that the Chairman of the campaign's brother was a registered agent of the Clinton campaign; registered agent of a Russian bank? On, that's not a problem.

How about millions of dollars going to the Clinton foundation while the Secretary of State approves on Uranium being given to the Russian -- being sold to the Russian? That's not a problem. This city right now, the news media in this country is in a frenzy that is leading it to desperately seek something. They know something was wrong. They just don't know what it is. And every time something comes up, they grossly exaggerated. The Democrats pick up the exaggeration, and the news media picks up the Democrats, and we get up in what we think is the equivalent of hysteria.

MACCALLUM: Hyperventilating. Thank you very much, Newt, good to see you as always tonight.

GINGRICH: Anytime. Thank you.

MACCALLUM: So, big changes coming today to the GOP health care bill, but our change is the same thing as progress. Have we moved the ball forward on any of this? The Senators who got their wish list say, yes, they think it is.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: Today was a very important day. It was a productive step in the right direction.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MACCALLUM: So, what does Bill Bennett think? He is standing by, next to talk about that. And his take may surprise you on the opioid crisis which he has studied in depth. He will talk about that, moments away. And new questions for dreamers tonight: will those brought here illegally as children be able to stay? The White House could be changing its tune on this. Stick around for the news where that's concerned. Plus, one of our morning favorites stayed late at night for us tonight, Brian Kilmeade, on Peyton Manning, medi-cad, you heard me right. And the congressional dress code, which Speaker Ryan addressed today. We'll be right back.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. PAUL RYAN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: It came to my attention that there was an issue about the dress code.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

MACCALLUM: Breaking tonight after months of delays, the Senate may finally have health care reform bill that might actually pass. So, what is new in this version? Among the big edits and additional 70 billion for states to make their own reforms, health savings accounts that can help you pay down your premiums, and additional $45 billion towards the Opioid epidemic; more on that in a moment, and the option to buy a cheap plan if you want a cheap plan that has less coverage. Despite these changes, there's still pretty clear divide on Capitol Hill as to whether or not this is going to happen. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: The revised draft improves on the previous version in a number of ways, all while retaining the fundamental goals of providing stability and improving affordability.

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-NEW YORK: The bottom line is this: the core of this bill is just as rotten as it was before.

SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KENTUCKY: This is an insurance bailout on steroids.

SEN. JOHN THUNE, R-SOUTH DAKOTA: We have to find the sweet spot, try and find the balance that takes into consideration, all those different perspectives, and come up with a bill that we think we can get on the president's desk.

SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, D-CONNECTICUT: I think this proposal is in effect. Let's take on a pig, its cosmetic changes to a fundamentally flawed, cruel, and costly proposal.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MACCALLUM: Joining me now Dr. Bill Bennett, Fox News contributor, and our nation's first-ever Drugs Czar. Bill, good evening. Good to see you tonight. So, what do you make of this new version and do you think you can pass?

DR. BILL BENNETT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think it's better. I think it's progress. But you know, I have tipped my hat to Ted Cruz. I think he has been the positive impression on a couple things. First of all, he introduced this bill which is getting some traction. It gives more flexibility. There is more freedom in this bill. But the basic heart of ObamaCare is still there, and this is what people like Rand Paul object to. The other thing about Ted Cruz -- way back when you remember reading Dr. Seuss on the floor and all that? He warned us that if this passed, ObamaCare passed, it would be near impossible to get rid of, even with majorities, Republican Majorities or Republican president. People are getting used to the idea that there's a right to health care, but the federal government should provide it. And this is obviously what's creating the problem. So, I hope this thing goes --

MACCALLUM: That is a great point. And they have to accept that fact, you know, that the benefit that was given, including the tax cuts for the wealthy and investments to pay for it, all of that is still in here and it's not going anywhere, it doesn't look like.

BENNETT: Yes. And it seems it's very hard to take away. Once given, it's very hard to take away. People become accustomed to the condition that habituated to these things very quickly.

MACCALLUM: All right. Let me talk to you about something that I know you care quite a bit about, and that's the opioid crisis in this country. So, this bill adds a lot more money to try to battle that crisis. A shocking new report from HHS breaks down some stunning figures on how addicted America has become; finding roughly 3.5 million Americans on Medicaid Part D received opioids for at least six months in 2016. So, Bill, is putting $45 billion into this problem the way to go?

BENNETT: Well, it depends on how you spend it. It's a start. I was the first Drugs Czar. And you introduce me as that, that's right, and that was the time of the cocaine crisis and epidemic. The situation we have now, Martha, is worse. Let me quote my friend John Walters in a report he just wrote: ""The current trafficking in opioids in the United States may be the most murderous criminal activity in the history of the United States."" Let me say that again, this may be the murderous criminal activity in the history of our country; 30, 40, 50, 60,000 deaths a year.

And let me explain something because I'm afraid this is just been lost. Everybody thinks that the major part of this problem is overprescribing by doctors. Well, we have had a problem with overprescribing by doctors and some pill mills out there, but that is not the major problem now. Our major problem now is the importation of these illegal drugs, lots of heroin, lots of fentanyl, lots of things like them; they're very cheap on the streets, and we are not getting after them. And there's a second reason we're not getting after them. Everyone thinks the problem is helping rehabilitation. Well, health is a major part of it, but rehabilitation is very difficult, and the best kind of rehabilitation is prevention: keeping people from getting it in the first place.

If you have poison coming into the system, you don't just set up a number of poison control centers. You try to stop the poison from coming in. And we're not focusing on that part of the problem. And we have to. We've had a couple of successes around the country on this, there's a task force in Southern Indiana that got after it. But you need a coordinated effort of law enforcement, international efforts, the health care community, and churches, and other voluntary organizations to go after it. If you don't, it's going to get worse.

MACCALLUM: I don't know any families who haven't -- excuse me, I don't know any families who have not known someone or lost someone in their own family due to this. I just want to let people know this fact: almost

70,000 beneficiaries received what the Inspector General labeled as extreme amounts of the drugs. And average daily consumption for the year, that was more than two and half times the level the CDC recommends avoiding.

I mean, and that doesn't even include people who are on cancer treatments, and you know who maybe have a legitimate reason, in those cases, to get these drugs. There's a vast over prescription problem. And I know that you said that it's getting better and that is good news, but you can go get your wisdom teeth pulled out and they're going to hand your prescription for this stuff on your way out the door, Bill.

BENNETT: They are. And again, it's a serious problem and I do not mean to understate it. But I'm telling you as this number have gone down, the overprescribing and the amount of pills in the system; it's still a serious problem. But the debts have increased, and they've increased because $2.00 will buy you heroin on the street. Fentanyl, you can get very cheaply as well, and it's all across the country, and we're doing enough to keep it from coming in. Look, we can attack all sides of this problem and we need to; that's what we did in the late 70s -- late 80s and the early 90s. And you know something, we got the problem down. We have to get the problem down again, Martha.

MACCALLUM: So true. Thank you very much, Bill. Good to see you tonight.

BENNETT: You are welcome.

MACCALLUM: So, still ahead, outrage growing over a controversial bill in Oregon that would put taxpayers, including religious organizations on the hook for abortions. That must-see debate, straight ahead. Plus this:

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: We cannot let them come into this country, period. We're going to have extreme vetting, and I mean extreme.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MACCALLUM: All these are back on the table now, three big moves today in these campaign promises. Governor Mike Huckabee, here with his reaction to the latest on immigration from the Trump team.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: We will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties, in which he defied federal law and the constitution to give amnesty to approximately five million illegal immigrants. Five million.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MACCALLUM: So, that was then-candidate Trump on the campaign trail. Now, President Trump is working to rally his base with several new developments on the immigration front. Dreamers once thought to be safe, may now be in jeopardy as DHS Secretary Kelly signals in a closed-door session with lawmakers that DACA may not survive a potentially looming court battle. Then you've got to crackdown on legal immigration. New reports on an upcoming bill that would cut the number of legal immigrants allowed into the country by 50 percent over ten years. And the state department, now cracking down on other countries, essentially, making them vet or face sanctions if they don't do so in a way that the United States believes is tough enough. So here now, former Arkansas governor, Mike Huckabee, who is a Fox News contributor. Governor, welcome. Good to have you here tonight.

MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS: Thank you, Martha.

MACCALLUM: So, I want to start, actually, by playing reaction to what happened in that closed-door session with the head of the DHF, General Kelly, and the reaction from Representative Gutierrez to the suggestion that DACA may not hold up in court, and those people may have to go back. Watch this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Secretary Kelly has absolutely no understanding of this department. I mean, he is either just the most -- I don't know, unmanageable member of the cabinet that I have ever met in my 25 years here, or he's trying to make a fool out of us by trying to say, oh, it's the courts.

(END VIDEO CLIP)



MACCALLUM: Pretty strong words. What do you think, governor?

HUCKABEE: Well, I think the representative is missing something. President Obama should have done this legislatively because he did it by executive order and he had no authority to do it. What he did was a legislative act and he doesn't have the constitutional authority to do it. What he should have done is gone to congress and say look, we've got people who are here because they came as children. We don't want to just force them to leave. They didn't commit a crime. Their parents may have come across the border illegally. And I think that that would've been a legitimate thing for the president to do. But he didn't want take the time to do it legislatively. Now we have two problems. One is of the federal level where you have this issue of what's legal, what we should do with people who come here illegally. But Martha, there's a totally separate issue at the state level. What you do with these children who had nothing to do with being here.

MACCALLUM: And you defended DACA in Arkansas as governor, correct?

HUCKABEE: Yes, I did. And I have taken a lot of grief for it. A lot of hate mail. I'll get some tonight. But when you have a child who came here at four, and under state law was required to go to the schools and did so, and what if that child -- we have one in Arkansas, one of the largest, most fluent high school, came here when he was four, and the only school he knew was U.S. schools. He was the valedictorian in his senior class. Now the question, should we allow him to go to college and maybe becomes a software engineer or a doctor, or are we go and make him pick tomatoes? Quite frankly, from a pragmatic standpoint, he'll pay far more taxes if he's a software engineer or a doctor and he's college educated. So that's a separate issue than the federal issue. But I think President Obama created a mess by not having the patience to go through and get this done legislatively.

MACCALLUM: I hear what you're saying. I want to get a quick thought from you also on one of these other ideas, which is cutting legal immigration by

50 percent. We take about a million legal immigrants every year. And Tom Cotton brought this forward, and now the president is supportive of it, that over the next ten years they want to cut that number to 500,000 a year. What do you think?

HUCKABEE: I think the bigger question than how many it ought to be why they're coming. I'm not as worried about how many people come. If they come here to help build America, make it a great country, to assimilate and be part of this melting pot that we've already always been. But if people want to come here because they hear that we're going to give them free things or because maybe they want to disrupt America, or they want America to become more like them, than them become more like America, then I don't care how many or how few. That's not a good reason for a person to be allowed to immigrate here.

MACCALLUM: Governor Mike Huckabee, thank you very much, always good to see you, sir.

HUCKABEE: Thank you, Martha.

MACCALLUM: So still had tonight, a call to arms as one lawmaker dons a sleeveless dress on the house floor, defying an unwritten congressional dress code that has caused quite a stir in Washington. Brian Kilmeade is still awake, and he will join us on that coming up. And also this, a radical bill is about to become law in Oregon. This could put taxpayers in the state on the hook for abortion way out of the mainstream, all of that coming up next in a debate, right after this.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



MACCALLUM: Developing tonight, a radical new bill is about to be signed by the governor of Oregon, that would enforce insurers and taxpayers to fund free abortions for virtually any reason at any time, including sex selective and late-term abortions. Critics have called this grisly and appalling. Trace Gallagher has this story for us live from our west coast newsroom. Hi, Trace.

TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS: Hi, Martha. There are still no date set for the signing of Oregon house bill 3391, but any question about where Governor Kate Brown stands on this was pretty much answered when she tweeted, quoting, yes, yes, yes, and then shared a link to an article titled, Oregon legislature approves reproductive services bill covering abortions, contraceptives. The governor followed with this statement, quote, attempts to deny access to contraceptives and family planning are an attack on all Oregonians, particularly women of color, low income, and young women. What this means is that insurance companies in Oregon will now be required to cover abortion at zero cost to patients, and companies that cover abortions for illegal immigrants will be reimbursed by the state.

Religious employers and insurers that currently do not cover abortion are exempt, but any women who fall into those categories would also have their abortions covered by the state. Planned Parenthood, which is struggling financially and has recently shut down four clinics in Oregon, helped draft this bill and then lobbied to pass it. Some GOP state lawmakers say the law is a gift card to Planned Parenthood, and that state taxes should not go towards something that many Oregonians are morally opposed to. Listen to both sides.

UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's important to have abortion as an option so that women have a chance to really choose when their pregnancy happened. And that every baby is a planned and wanted baby.

UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're totally against it because of the abortion component of it. Abortion is taking away the innocent and innocent human life. And this bill will inevitably increase abortions.

(END VIDEO CLIP)



GALLAGHER: Oregon's Democratic lawmakers say this bill will protect reproductive rights regardless of what happens on the federal level, referring of course to the Trump administration and congressional Republicans pushing to defund Planned Parenthood. Martha.

MACCALLUM: Trace, thank you. Here with more, Lila Rose, founder and president of live action, and Danielle McLaughlin, author and political commentator. Welcome to both of you. Danielle, let's start with you. I mean, on the -- of it, the need to allow late-term, even full-term abortions for an illegal immigrant, this is the most extreme example, so if you've just arrived in Oregon and say, this is what I'd like to have done, and the taxpayer needs to pay for it seems very extreme. No?

DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, AUTHOR: Sure it does, when you use that example. When you use the example of a low income woman who's working three jobs, who has three children, but she doesn't want otherwise have -- but this still doesn't just allow for funding for abortion. It's contraceptive care. It's preventative care. It's pre-screening's. It's a whole host, frankly, of health care for women, and actually -- frankly, ObamaCare currently covers, that a state like Oregon, Maryland, also is concerned it would go away if the GOP changes health care protections in this country.

MACCALLUM: Lila?

LILA ROSE, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF LIVE ACTION: I think it's horrific because women deserve better than abortion. And this Oregon bill is basically saying women, undocumented immigrants, whomever, abortion is a solution for your problem, killing children up through the ninth month of pregnancy for any reason is a positive thing, so positive that we're going to force insurance companies. We're going to force individuals to buy those plans. We're going to force taxpayers in Oregon to pay for it, and their estimates being done that this could increase abortion. This could kill 3,000 more children a year in Oregon. There're actually lives at stake here, innocent lives, pre-born children.

MCLAUGHLIN: Oregon is one of the states in this country that has almost no abortion law.

(CROSSTALK)

MCLAUGHLIN: Well, you say that. Of course, Oregon is governed by Roe vs. Wade, by Planned Parenthood this is -- by any other Supreme Court law.

MACCALLUM: You're going to pay for someone to decide because they don't like the sex of their baby to abort it at eight months?

(CROSSTALK)



MACCALLUM: Why would any state want to pass a law that would allow that?

It's barbaric.

MCLAUGHLIN: It's up to the state to do that. I personally think it's horrendous. I agree with you, Lila. But you can't legislate against in effect what the state wants to do. Last thing I'll say, Oregon has almost no abortion law at all. It's a low abortion rate than the rest of the country. So you can say more access to abortion means more abortion, that's not the case at all.

MACCALLUM: In 1994, they passed the first physician-assisted suicide, and then you had five more states that ended up allowing that as well. As a country, I think, facing the question of what you feel is -- falls into the lines of ethics.

(CROSSTALK)



ROSE: This is another defining moment for our country. And you even said it Danielle, you said look, I don't like it either.

MACCALLUM: So why would you want it to be -- why would you feel OK with it being a part of this bill?

MCLAUGHLIN: I'm just saying if this is what a person chooses, there're plenty of things that I don't like that are allowed.

(CROSSTALK)

MCLAUGHLIN: We think about other sort of thing we have a real moral quandary. Oregon is a state, has made a decision to make this access available to low income women who might otherwise not have this access.

(CROSSTALK)



MACCALLUM: I think that's potentially very offensive about how we need this especially for women of color and low income women and young women. I think to myself, well, you know.

(CROSSTALK)

ROSE: It's the opposite of the dignity of a woman to say, you're your child in order to get ahead in life, in order to deal with your problems. What's going to happen to that woman, whether she's low income, she's young, she's going to be then the mother of a child who's is dead, and have the same problems in her live and the same kinds of issues.

(CROSSTALK)

ROSE: This is as problem. And this is a larger debate going on in our country right now. We have a law, Roe v. Wade that was passed. That ultimately rule of the land that even experts on the pro-abortion side had says is a bad law. It says it doesn't actually -- it shouldn't actually be the rule of the land. And so, you have states doing extreme things like this because we got it wrong at the Supreme Court. And that's where Americans are so divided on this because they know deep-down that's a child, that's a life, and that this is wrong.

MACCALLUM: Danielle, last word and then we've got to go.

MCLAUGHLIN: This is about more than abortion. I think we need to fix that in a global scene. This is about access to health care, whether you earn $100,000 a year or whether you earn $1,000 a month. So this is not just about abortion.

MACCALLUM: But it does include these elements.

MCLAUGHLIN: Yes, it does. But there are plenty of these kinds of things that have really terrible and very trying element, and the very important element that means women can make economic decisions that are ultimately helpful.

ROSE: Send the bill back, take out abortion.

MACCALLUM: We've got to leave it there, ladies. Thank you very much for bringing your opinion to the table tonight. So coming up tonight, we're going to tell you the story behind some of the viral images that are out there today, including the lawmaker who dared to bear her arms in congress. Also, the lawmaker who forgot to use spell check, look at this, I mean, there's something wrong. OK. And in this picture of an unamused Kevin Durant at last night ESPY Awards. Brian Kilmeade joins me to run down these pictures that tell the story. And there he is.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

MACCALLUM: So cooler heads are prevailing as the temperature rises in Washington over the Capitol Hill dress code. Last week, a controversy erupted claiming Speaker Paul Ryan was refusing to let women wear sleeveless dresses and open toe shoes during the hot dog days of summer, while the unwritten rule was never Ryan's idea, a long-term policy generated a whole lot of heat. Earlier this week, Republican congresswoman, Martha McSally, defy the rules by wearing a sleeveless dress on the house floor, and today a big announcement from Speaker Ryan.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



PAUL RYAN, HOUSE SPEAKER: Decorum is important, especially for this institution. And a dress code in the chamber, in the lobby, makes sense. But we also don't need a bar, otherwise accepted contemporary business attire. So look for a change in that soon.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MACCALLUM: So business casual. No one knows what it is, right? Here now Fox & Friends co-host, Brian Kilmeade. You can also catch him on the Kilmeade Show on Fox News radio where you can also catch me every Wednesday with Bill Hemmer. How are you doing, Brian?

BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX & FRIENDS CO-HOST: I'm doing great. Thanks for having me.

MACCALLUM: So what do you think? Is it horrific to see -- to do the sleeveless thing and the open toe, both of which --

KILMEADE: Right. So this has been on the books for a while, I guess, open toe, no sleeves.

MACCALLUM: Nancy Pelosi was fine with the dress code, apparently.

KILMEADE: But guess who they enforce it -- eventually, Friday is get-away- day, and everyone kinds of dresses down.

MACCALLUM: Right.

KILMEADE: Even the men come in sometimes in jeans. But the only people they really got it enforced, you know the press. And this CBS reporter walked in and they said you have no sleeves, you can't go in.

MACCALLUM: Right.

KILMEADE: And then, she said, OK, I'm going to put some paper in my sleeves.

MACCALLUM: It's like going to the Vatican.

KILMEADE: Right. And they go, no, no, you can't put paper -- and she wrote the story. And then, of course, we see Martha McSally who served in the military, also protested to Donald Rumsfeld when she was in Saudi Arabia, and they said you've got to hear something on your head, and said I'm not doing that.

MACCALLUM: She likes to be comfortable.

KILMEADE: Right. And I've met a lot of people who don't wear sleeves. They're wonderful people. They look fantastic.

MACCALLUM: There's a lot of sleeveless around here. However, I think dress codes are appropriate. And I think that we've gotten too far away from dress codes. I think we've become like a sweat pants nation.

KILMEADE: Right.

MACCALLUM: And I think that there are places where a certain amount of decorum is required. And I think that close toe shoes and sleeves are OK in congress, as long as the guys don't take off their jacket in that room.

KILMEADE: Right. That would be the problem. Then it would be the double standard. So look what's happening on Friday, I just printed this out because I don't have the money for a color printer. But this is sleeveless Friday is tomorrow. And then, they're going to have a picture on the steps to show that women.

MACCALLUM: This is a priority, right?



KILMEADE: Can we raise the debt ceiling if you have some time we'll good health care?

MACCALLUM: All right. We'll be moving along. So on the topic of congress, Democratic senator, Maria Cantwell, is being mocked for this critique of the Republican health care plan. Can you spot the mistake? I mean, if you can't, you have a problem. War of Medicad. Look at all these people standing around that time.

KILMEADE: Right. Now, I didn't think there's a war on Medicaid, but I did know there's a war on Medicad. And that's what I'm protesting this morning. How about this guy? The guy that put it there is just sitting -- would you put the picture up again. His job was to get the easel and put the picture up.

MACCALLUM: Are you calling the shots on my show?

KILMEADE: If you don't mind because I just think they should understand it. He's so confident that this is spelled right. Look how bored he looks.

MACCALLUM: you know what? We have also become a nation that doesn't understand spelling.

KILMEADE: Right.

MACCALLUM: And it's OK to have these kinds of errors, which I find really egregious and lame. Get your spelling correct.

KILMEADE: In the age of the iPhone and the drone, we're back to easels and-- can we please kick it up a notch? Can someone do a Power Point and just do it up the entire constituency?

MACCALLUM: Good point. And finally, NBA superstar Kevin Durant looked this upset last night at the ESPY Awards. They did this dig from host Peyton Manning. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



PEYTON MANNING, FORMER FOOTBALL PLAYER: Our gymnastics team was so dominant that Kevin Durant told me he wants to play for them next year.

(LAUGHTER)

MANNING: And I've got to tell you, I don't think you'll start for that team, Kevin. Russel Westbrook, what do you think?

(END VIDEO CLIP)



MACCALLUM: He looks pretty mad, Brian. What do you think?

KILMEADE: So here's the background, you know that he went to the Golden State Warriors after they went 75-4. Last year, he went to a great team as a great player, they said you shouldn't have done that. How could you do it? You basically rigged the game. He went and won a championship. So for him to do that, he get called out, people said wow, he's not laughing. Evidently, it's a total put on, he was told to put that face on. He worked it out with Peyton Manning ahead of time. He is not really angry.

MACCALLUM: He's not mad, oh good.

KILMEADE: He put it on.

MACCALLUM: I'm so relieved. I was really worried that the two of them might not be getting along for a while.

KILMEADE: Yeah. Between the $150 million contract and the world championship he's been down in the dumps. So this could be -- no, he was really -- that was a put on. How great is Peyton Manning, though? He was awesome in those things.

MACCALLUM: Let's watch Peyton Manning with Jimmy Fallon here -- I'm sorry.

KILMEADE: Jimmy Kimmel.

MACCALLUM: . Kimmel. Jimmy Kimmel.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



MANNING: To me, no matter what you believe sour -- you know, I heard Arnold Palmer say one time, if the president of the United States ever ask you to play golf, you do it. And I think it would have been almost un-American to have said no.

(END VIDEO CLIP)



KILMEADE: Jimmy Kimmel was challenging him about, why did you play golf with the president of the United States, he said because he asked me. That's what you do in America, un-American not to play. Can you believe that this is actually controversial? Peyton Manning.

MACCALLUM: I love it in this audience is when the people -- they were applauding for Peyton Manning.

KILMEADE: Right, they did.

MACCALLUM: Yeah.

KILMEADE: But Jimmy Kimmel has become so anti-Trump, he's almost as bad as Stephen Colbert.

MACCALLUM: But the audience went against him on that one.

KILMEADE: They did.

MACCALLUM: Brian, thank you. We're in pay-per-view. We're going to take a quick break. We'll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

MACCALLUM: Before we go, this is a great story, President Trump personally intervening to allow a group of Afghan teens to come to the United States to participate in a robotics competition. So the State Department reportedly dismissed their visa request at least twice, but once the president heard about it he ask the team to try to find a solution for them and they did through a special waiver. We heard about those somewhere else tonight, right. But the tenacious teenagers will have to do the competition without their original robot, which is stuck in customs? That's the part they didn't fix that. But it didn't stop them, they got here, and they remade the robot with household items. They're geniuses, obviously. So the first global challenge is set for this weekend in Washington. Good story, right? Thanks for being here. We will see you tomorrow night at 7:00. Coming up right next, my friend Tucker Carlson from Washington. Good night, everybody.

Schoen Is A Fox News Contributor. He Has More Than Years Experience As A Pollster', 'Political Consultant. His New Book Is']",FOX News,"On Tuesday morning, Donald Trump, Jr., tweeted a statement with corresponding documentation of an email chain between him and publicist Rob Goldstone.

The email chain showed that in June 2016, Donald Trump, Jr., walked into a meeting – facilitated by Goldstone – with the understanding that he would potentially be given damaging information about Hillary Clinton through a source that had direct ties to Russian government officials as high up as “The Crown Prosecutor of Russia,” according to the emails.

Given that such a position does not exist in Russia, it is likely the email was referring to Russia’s Prosecutor General, Yury Chaika.

In preparation for this meeting, it was made clear in the email chain that the Russian government supported President Trump’s candidacy.

According to the email chain, the information was “obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump” and that the information would allegedly be “very useful” to Donald Trump, Jr.’s father.

As someone who has been a political operative, it is commonplace to get requests for meetings such as the one outlined in the emails released. But to involve campaign officials at the highest levels creates clear conflicts and is highly troubling.

Donald Trump, Jr., was enthusiastic about this meeting, which was with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, saying that if the information “is what you say I love it.”

In his statement Tuesday, Donald Trump, Jr., claimed to be posting the email correspondence in order to be “totally transparent.” Although his intentions are respectable, the results are not, and cannot, be what he may have hoped.

Despite his supposed transparency, there are wildly competing explanations regarding what exactly the truth is behind these emails, the meeting, and ultimately, the exchange of information.

Thus far, there has been no publicly recorded evidence of any collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign. Even with the new revelations of Donald Trump, Jr.’s meeting with a lawyer allegedly close to the Kremlin, there is still is no definitive evidence of collusion – but it is getting a lot closer.

Why? This is the first reported contact between a high-level official in the Trump campaign and a Russian government official. In this particular case, campaign manager Paul Manafort and senior adviser Jared Kushner were involved in a meeting which explicitly covered issues relating to Hillary Clinton and the presidential campaign.

As someone who has been a political operative—as well as someone who has been put in the same position that Donald Trump, Jr., was put in many times—it is commonplace to get requests for meetings such as the one outlined in the emails released. But to involve campaign officials at the highest levels creates clear conflicts and is highly troubling.

Despite Donald Trump, Jr.’s efforts to be transparent, we still do not know Natalia Veselnitskaya’s full professional background, who she was representing, what sensitive information she in fact had, or whether in fact, and perhaps most importantly, Donald Trump, Jr., received any objective help as a result of the meeting.

These are just a few of the questions that remain unanswered in this controversy.

This is now the first indication – and it is only an indication – that there may have been some systematic effort by the Russians to not only meddle but to directly intrude and help President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.

Donald Trump, Jr.’s repeated explanations of what happened do not provide the necessary clarification needed about the full extent of this meeting.

Looking forward, it is imperative now that not only the relevant House and Senate committees complete full investigations into what exactly happened, but that Special Counselor Bob Mueller and his investigative team determine what transpired, what information may or not have been shared, and specifically between which parties.

Clearly, such clarity demands more than just a few email screenshots and rushed statements via Twitter. American voters deserve honesty from our leadership and to know the full truth about the Trump campaign’s associations with Russian nationals."

Trump urged to hunt down, fire leakers",[],FOX News,"President Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski predicted Wednesday that the leakers driving coverage of Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting last year with a Russian lawyer will be fired, as the White House reportedly scrambles to find the source or sources.

“Anybody, and I mean anybody who is not on the president’s agenda that works in this administration should absolutely be removed immediately,” Lewandowski told “Fox & Friends” on Wednesday morning.

“I don’t know who the leaker is but let me tell you this, if it were up to me, and somebody was speaking to the media [and leaking information detrimental to Trump], I would fire them on the spot, and Donald Trump will do the same,” he added.

Numerous accounts in the wake of the Trump Jr. revelations have described the White House as racked by internal drama and suspicion. In seeming reference to such stories, the president tweeted Wednesday morning: “Remember, when you hear the words ‘sources say’ from the Fake Media, often times those sources are made up and do not exist.”

TRUMP TWEETS DEFENSE OF JR.

But there is little question the president’s inner circle would like to get to the bottom of the leaks.

The latest – and perhaps most serious – Russia-related controversy started when The New York Times began reporting on a meeting Donald Trump Jr., then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner had last summer with a Russian lawyer who apparently offered to provide dirt on Hillary Clinton.

Trump Jr. on Tuesday ultimately published the emails he exchanged with the contact who set up the meeting -- music publicist Rob Goldstone. Those emails describe the offer of incriminating information on Clinton as part of ""Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.""

Trump Jr. responded that, ""if it’s what you say I love it …”

According to the president’s eldest son, such information was never provided. Donald Trump Jr. acknowledged in an exclusive interview with Fox News' ""Hannity"" Tuesday night that he ""probably would have done things a little differently.""

TRUMP JR.: I WOULD HAVE DONE THINGS DIFFERENTLY

""This [was] pre-Russia fever. This [was] pre-Russia mania,"" Trump Jr. told Fox News' Sean Hannity. ""I don’t think my sirens went [off] or my antenna went up at this time because it wasn’t the issue that it’s been made out to be over the last nine months, ten months.""

However, the president’s eldest son also described the meeting as ""a nothing,"" adding, ""I wouldn’t have even remembered it until you started scouring through this stuff. It was literally just a wasted 20 minutes, which was a shame.""

Axios reports there’s considerable anger on the Trump team over who leaked the information to the Times in the first place.

Speculation is widespread over who may have provided the material and had a motive to do so. An earlier Times article described the sourcing as “three advisers to the White House briefed on the meeting and two others with knowledge of it.”

According to the Times, Trump Jr. posted his emails on Twitter only after being told the newspaper was about to publish their contents.

As the Kremlin also reportedly is denying reaching out to a Moscow property developer to set up the meeting in question, Lewandowski told Fox News that the session was just a “courtesy meeting.”

Further, Lewandowski – who was still campaign manager at the time – said he “knew nothing about the meeting” because it “was a nothing meeting.”

“I think what this is is a giant distraction for the mainstream media about a story about nothing, and that is prohibiting the president from getting his agenda done,” he said.

Asked about the possibility of formally returning to the president’s team, Lewandowski said he likes his outside work now but would not rule out helping the president if he wants.

While Lewandowski and other Trump allies have sought to downplay the latest controversy, the contents of the emails have fueled bipartisan concerns about Trump associates’ contacts with Russia last year. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have indicated they’ll want to hear testimony from Trump Jr.

Trump defended his son on Twitter Wednesday morning.

“My son Donald did a good job last night. He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!” he wrote."

In the space of just 24 hours, the president, his new chief of staff and his summarily dispatched communications director were the target of damaging or embarrassing leaks.

And remember, this is supposed to be a new era, with a four-star general running a much tighter ship.

As a journalist I thrive on being able to find out what’s going on behind the scenes. But in this administration I continue to be amazed at how much stuff is whispered to reporters in furtherance of personal agendas.

Anthony Scaramucci, who came in as communications director with loud proclamations about firing leakers, was himself the target of a gusher of leaks after being fired Monday by chief of staff John Kelly. One unnamed White House official told Politico, “No way could he work with Kelly. His antics over the past week were crazy by any standard.” An official also described the Mooch as constantly reminding aides in meetings that he wasn’t “one of them.""



This also speaks to the Beltway’s kick-’em-when-they’re-down culture in which everyone piles on when you’re down, even though Scaramucci suffered from self-inflicted wounds. Thus, when Reince Priebus was ousted, someone leaked that President Trump once asked him to come in and kill a fly.

CNN hit Kelly with a rough story on his first day at the White House. Quoting unnamed sources, the network said Kelly, as Homeland Security chief, ""was so upset with how President Donald Trump handled the firing of FBI Director James Comey that Kelly called Comey afterward and said he was considering resigning.""



It was not clear how serious Kelly was, CNN said, but Comey urged him by phone not to resign. Obviously this may create some awkwardness with his new boss.

In a potentially more serious piece than those involving internal backbiting, the Washington Post reported Monday night that the president “personally dictated a statement” about his son and that June 2016 meeting with several Russians.

The statement to the New York Times said that Donald Trump Jr. (along with Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort) and the Russian lawyer had “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children.”

That turned out to be so limited as to be misleading, as became clear when the Times obtained more information and Don Jr. had to put out a second statement acknowledging that he’d been told the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, had damaging information on Hillary Clinton that Russia’s “government” wanted to share with the campaign. This was confirmed when Don Jr. released a series of emails before the Times could publish them.

Kellyanne Conway told ""Special Report"" that Trump said ""he weighed in, like any father would.""

I’ve previously reported that the president’s son wanted to make a fuller disclosure at the outset but was essentially overruled. The importance of this leak is that the blame previously fell on senior White House officials who were working on the statement while flying back from the G-20 meeting. Plus, it contradicts an earlier denial from Jay Sekulow, the president’s lawyer. Sekulow now says “the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate, and not pertinent.”

The Post even quotes an anonymous presidential adviser as saying, “Now someone can claim he’s the one who attempted to mislead.” It doesn’t exactly sound like this adviser has Trump’s best interests at heart.



History would suggest there’s no way to stop leaks. Richard Nixon failed, even after creating the “plumbers” unit, a covert investigative group whose techniques included burglary.

The big difference in this administration is that the president is often damaged by these leaks and they sometimes include classified information. And there’s no sign that these leaks will recede any time soon."

Trump has tweeted support for his son only a few times – including teasing his media appearances – and said in a prepared statement that Trump Jr. is a “high-quality person.”

Trump Jr. is under fire for taking a meeting with a Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June 2016 – during the height of his father’s presidential campaign.

According to public emails pertaining to the meeting, the information about Clinton was “obviously very high level and sensitive” and was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”

News of the meeting sparked fresh questions about whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the White House.

Here’s what Trump has said about his son and the Russia allegations publicly since news of the meeting broke earlier this month.

‘That’s politics’

Trump tweeted on July 17 that “most politicians” would have taken similar meetings.

“Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one [Trump Jr.] attended in order to get info on an opponent,” Trump tweeted. “That’s politics!”

‘Fake News’

In a July 16 tweet, Trump criticized his former presidential opponent and the media.

“Hillary Clinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?” Trump tweeted early Sunday morning.

DONALD TRUMP JR.’S MEETING WITH RUSSIAN LAWYER: WHAT TO KNOW

It got more than 34,000 retweets.

‘Zero happened’

While in Paris for the Bastille Day parade, Trump said “zero happened from the meeting.”

“Honestly, I think the press made a very big deal over something that really a lot of people would do,” Trump said.

“As far as my son is concerned, my son is a wonderful young man,” Trump also said.

‘High-quality person’

Through deputy White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the president praised his son’s “transparency” after he released the emails pertaining to the controversial meeting on Twitter.

“My son is a high-quality person, and I applaud his transparency,” Trump said in a statement on July 10.

TV appearances

Trump teased his son’s interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on July 11.

""My son, Donald, will be interviewed by [Hannity] tonight,” Trump said. “He is a great person who loves our country!”

The next day, Trump praised his son’s media appearance.

“My son Donald did a good job last night. He was open, transparent and innocent,” Trump said. “This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!”

SECRET SERVICE CONTRADICTS TRUMP LAWYER ON RUSSIA MEETING

He immediately followed that tweet with another criticizing the “Fake Media” and alleging that reporters make up sources.

Stock markets

Trump tweeted on July 15 that the stock market was doing well “despite the Russian hoax story.”

“Stock Market hit another all-time high yesterday – despite the Russian hoax story! Also, jobs numbers are starting to look very good!” he said.

In another tweet, Trump thanked former campaign advisor Michael Caputo for denying accusations of a collusion.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity,"" and this is a Fox News Alert, major breaking news tonight, an explosive report about the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump, Jr. It completely crushes Democrats, and of course, the destroy Trump media's talking points. It raises some very serious new questions about the Obama administration. John Solomon, who broke this story, will be here tonight with the stunning details. Also, Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett, Laura Ingraham, Lou Dobbs are all here tonight with reaction.

But first, a special ""Hannity"" investigation into stories and scandals that are all but being ignored by the mainstream media but must be investigated. This is something you will only see right here tonight on ""Hannity,"" and that's tonight's ""Opening Monologue.""

All right, The Hill reporter John Solomon and his colleague are out with a bombshell report about the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump, Jr., last summer. Here's the headline. Quote, ""Exclusive. DOJ let Russian lawyer into U.S. before she met with Trump team.""

Now, the report finds that the former Obama attorney general Loretta Lynch allowed this Russian lawyer to enter the country under, quote, ""extraordinary circumstances"" and without a visa. And after a June 9th meeting with Donald Trump, Jr., guess what? The lawyer was spotted in the front row of a June 14th hearing of America's policies towards Russia!

The Hill is also reporting that this lawyer was part of a pro-Russian lobbying effort, went to an event in Washington. Remember the Magnitsky Act? That was the one attended by congressional staffers and State Department officials.

Now, this new information is raising very serious questions if this lawyer is so sinister and nefarious, and whether or not it's connected to the Russian government, like the Democrats and the media have been trying to tell you. And why did the former attorney general, Loretta Lynch, allow her into the country?

Why did the Obama administration allow her into the country? Why was she allowed to attend a congressional hearing and other events with government officials in Washington, D.C.?

Now, there's also another report that says this Russian lawyer has ties to the Democrats. So meeting with Donald Trump, Jr., to try and hurt Hillary Clinton's campaign -- it doesn't really make sense anymore, which, by the way, the lawyer says she never had any damaging information on Clinton. And Solomon and his colleague are breaking yet another story, major news tonight, with the headline, quote, well, ""U.S. Congressman got similar approach from Russian officials two months before Trump's son.""

Now, John will be here in just a minute with all the details, but first, our ""Hannity"" investigation into a massive election interference scandal that the destroy Trump media is not reporting on and that Democrats don't want you to know about. They won't go near it, but we will continue to expose the truth until they have to cover this and tell you what's really going on.

Now, back in January, the Politico published a stunning report that had this headline. Here's the headline. ""Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire."" Kiev officials are scrambling to make amends with president- elect after quietly working to boost Clinton. Now, one-time DNC operative -- her name is Alexandra Chalupa. She led the effort, along with Ukrainian government officials. Why? They wanted to help Hillary Clinton and try and damage Donald Trump during the 2016 election cycle.

Now, according to Politico, Chalupa, who previously worked for the Clinton White House, was the key play (ph) in this plan and met with Ukrainian diplomats at the Ukrainian embassy to discuss ways to, quote, ""expose"" former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. And Chalupa told Politico that those Ukrainian diplomats were, quote, ""helpful"" when it came to finding leads for digging up dirt.

And then there's this shocking quote for (sic) the article about Chalupa. She occasionally -- she shared her findings with officials from the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign. So according to that report, Chalupa was working with Ukraine and also offering up information that she found to the DNC and the Clinton campaign. Sound like collusion?

Well, it doesn't end there. Chalupa also said that she would assist, quote, ""a lot of journalists"" in writing stories about Manafort and the Trump campaign.

Now, we reached out to Chalupa for comment on this explosive story. She hasn't gotten back to us.

But there's one other thing. Enough is enough when it comes to this scandal. Tonight, we on this show are demanding answers, answers to questions that you, the American people, deserve to know about because the evidence that we have here points to a foreign power that actually did work to influence the election.

Alexandra Chalupa and the DNC operative at the center of the scandal -- she needs to be put under oath. She needs to tell Congress what she knew, when she knew it and who she told it to. And the same goes for the Ukrainian ambassador that Chalupa reportedly met with. And since Chalupa says that she met with the DNC and was employed and paid by them, by the way, maybe it's also time for Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- maybe she needs to answer questions under oath about Chalupa's exact role.

And by the way, that would include former Clinton campaign manager (sic) John Podesta. He needs to be called to testify since information was shared with the Clinton campaign. And Robbie Mook also.

And by the way, that's not the only scandals we've been covering and searching for answers for here tonight on ""Hannity."" Now, there's the fake news, of course, Christopher Steele's dossier -- remember that? -- that cited Russian sources. Now, that group, Fusion GPS -- they commissioned, they shopped around to the media all that information. And the Democrats routinely were citing it in public to you. Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote this fake document -- he needs to be subpoenaed. He did to be forced to talk about what he knows, when he knew it, how we (sic) obtained this information.

And we also need answers about the reports that the FBI, James Comey, offered to pay him as much as $50,000. Also speaking of James Comey, well, he's surrounded by controversy. He may have broken the law, remember, removing classified government property from the FBI. And Comey also admitted that he gave one of his memos to a friend so that they'd leak it to the press, in that case, The New York Times, because he wanted a special counsel.

Well, that special counsel turned out to be a long-time BFF of James Comey, Robert Mueller. Now, this guy has more conflict of interest than we can count.

So it's time to start investigating the investigator. Why did he hire Hillary Clinton's attorney? Why did he hire Obama and Hillary donors? And Mueller, by the way, potentially -- did he break the law? Is he being unethical? Is he conducting an investigation where his friend, James Comey, is the star witness? Does that need to be a case of recusal?

And on top of that, all the handful of investigators that donated only to Democratic presidential candidates -- take a look at this chart. Donations totalling $32,000, over $13,000, and the list goes on and on. So can we expect people who donated this type of money to Obama, to Clinton, to Democrats that Mueller is now -- are they going to be fair? Are they going to be impartial? Of course not.

And what's even more disturbing is that one of the lawyers working for Mueller worked for the Clinton Foundation. She didn't want you to know many things and she was trying to squash Freedom of Information Act requests.

Now, the special counsel is full of conflicts of interest. It's becoming more corrupt by the day. And it's time to expose who these people are.

And we've also found out that the former Obama attorney general, Loretta Lynch, influenced the investigation into Hillary's e-mail server. Remember? She told James Comey publicly it's a matter, it's not an investigation, and he listened to her. And then she met 40 minutes on a tarmac with Bill Clinton, just happened to be days before Comey let Hillary Clinton off the hook.

Now, Congress is only beginning to touch the surface on these issues and examine this, but they've got to up the urgency and move faster, including revisiting Hillary Clinton's e-mail investigation, so much evidence that, in fact, Lynch influenced the investigation. We know Hillary broke the law. Why? She had top-secret and she had classified, special access information program access information on her e-mail server. That's mishandling. That's a felony. And then she destroyed some of it. That's a felony also. That's breaking the law. Hillary Clinton needs to be held accountable. We're calling on that tonight.

And then we have the Uranium One deal. As her tenure as secretary of state, Hillary was one of nine people to approve the transfer of up to 20 percent of America's uranium to Vladimir Putin the Russians, a real conspiracy! People involved in that deal -- they kicked back as much as $145 million to the Clinton Foundation! Bill Clinton doubled his speaking fees in Moscow.

Now, Democrats and the media in the country. if they care about the rule of law, the equal application of the rule of law, then it's time and we'll start here demanding justice and we'll start investigating these scandals, and these people need to be put under oath.

From Circanews.com, Sara Carter is a lawyer and investigator, FOX News anchor, and of course, legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, and from The Hill, John Solomon. Guys, welcome back. Good to see you.

John, let's start. Let's go back to your investigative work here. Tell us why this is so critical to all the Donald Trump, Jr., hype.

JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL: Yes. Well, if you go back to last Saturday, just six days ago, you know, the story was there was a Kremlin-backed lawyer who snuck into the Trump Tower and had a secret conversation with Donald Trump, Jr., that looked like collusion. People were even using the word ""treason,"" I think, on Monday morning.

What we found out is that this lawyer was actually part of a lobbying campaign. She's a private attorney. It's a lobbying campaign that started before the Donald Trump meeting, in March in Moscow, when a congressman, Dana Rohrabacher, was approached and carried out all the way through June, when many members of Congress, some State Department officials, some staffers were all contacted by the same group, including this lawyer. to lobby about the Magnitsky act.

This was a classic lobbying operation, and as far as we can tell, no evidence that it was a collusion or campaign event, as it was originally portrayed to be...

HANNITY: You know, we always talk, Sara, about selective moral outrage on this program. In the case of the Ukraine, you have a DNC-paid operative who was admitting she actually met with foreigners, in this case Ukrainian -- and a Ukrainian ambassador. And she's admitting she passed on, you know, detrimental information to the DNC and the Clinton campaign.

Now, on paper, that is far worse than anything we know about Trump-Russia collusion, but it's basically been ignored. How bad is it? And should these people, as I'm suggesting, be put under oath?

SARA CARTER, CIRCANEWS.COM: Well, I certainly think that they can be called to testify. I mean, being able to look at these e-mails of Chalupa's and being able to see for ourselves how deep it goes when political people, political operatives are trying to get information on their opponents.

It's fascinating. It doesn't necessarily make it illegal, though, Sean, but it does make it very concerning when you look at the long laundry list of e-mails and how she was trying to gather this information.

And as for Natalia Veselnitskaya, I think what's really fascinating here is that she was lobbying against for the Magnitsky Act, and -- against it, you know. And one thing that's interesting that we've left out is Fusion GPS was also lobbying against the Magnitsky Act. And remember, they came up with the Christopher Steele dossier against President Trump. So just think about that convoluted matter right there and those connections.

These are all things that need to be investigated and they need to be looked into. And also, how she stayed beyond her special circumstances via from January, when it apparently ended, and she asked for that extension, and how she returned back, apparently, from Moscow sometime in early June. If you're to believe the Donald Trump, Jr., e-mails that go back and forth, she was actually in Moscow. So she got back into the United States.

HANNITY: Gregg, let me just get pure legal analysis from you. If you're looking at facts as a lawyer and you look at the Ukrainian situation -- meetings with foreign entities that want to obviously influence the election, with paid DNC officials, information is transferred to the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign, and nary a word is discussed about this by the very people that have been all over in government and the media -- all over with no evidence -- a so-called collusion story with the Trump campaign that's nonexistent.

GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS: Yes. What's troubling...

HANNITY: Where is more evidence here?

JARRETT: What's troubling is the hysteria over the Donald Trump, Jr., meeting, which is not illegal in any shape, or form, and the lack of equivalency and attention to, you know, the Chalupa-Hillary Clinton campaign and the Ukrainian embassy.

Now, I mean, I will say this. If the Ukrainian government and Chalupa and Hillary Clinton campaign colluded to undermine Donald Trump, that's not a crime, either. It's not treason. It's not conspiracy to defraud the government. It's not collusion, which only applies to anti-trust. It's not even a violation of the election laws.

In both cases, the Donald Trump case and in the Ukrainian case, it's just not against the law. The 1st Amendment, that pesky little document, provides complete defense.

(LAUGHTER)

HANNITY: That pesky little document? I know you love that pesky little document.

JARRETT: It is a complete defense to what Donald Trump did. It's clear from John's excellent reporting here that this Russian lawyer had an agenda. She pursued it under a false pretext, and it was then exposed. There is no crime here.

HANNITY: OK, real quick -- we'll do a lightning round. John, where is this headed next, in your opinion? And do you see Congress, that they have an obligation now to put the same focus and attention into both the dossier issue and the Ukrainian influence issue as they are Russia?

SOLOMON: There is a lot of investigating going on. Not all of it's at the Senate Intelligence Committee. I would keep an eye on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley. There's a hearing next week on the 19th where some of these players are going to be summoned. We're going to learn a lot that day, I think.

HANNITY: And Sara, it seems to me that it's only the tip of the iceberg here and it's only been a one-sided discussion in the country.

CARTER: Yes. And I think another thing to look for is law enforcement. You know, as the new FBI director takes his role at the FBI, there may be investigations that we haven't seen for a while reopen or light being shed on those, whether they have to do with Hillary Clinton and Uranium One and whether they have to do with other deals remains to be seen. But I think that's something that we need to look for, too.

HANNITY: All right, last word, Gregg.

JARRETT: Yes. The last point is an important one. It does appear there is evidence that Hillary Clinton used her government office to confer a benefit to a foreign government in exchange for money. That, if true, is a crime. And I do think you're right that a new investigation ought to be launched into the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal because she did what David Petraeus and John Deutch did. She stored classified documents at her home. That is a crime. And James Comey may have committed the exact same crime.

HANNITY: The same crime. All right, great analysis, all of you. We'll do what the media will not. We will stay on these investigations with far more evidence than what the media is feeding up (ph) to you.

When we come back, more reaction to this explosive report that the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump, Jr., last year was let into the U.S. by the Obama Justice Department. Laura Ingraham is here.

Also later tonight, during his joint news conference with the president of France, President Trump defended his son, Don, Jr. Lou Dobbs has reaction.

And then later, we're holding Washington accountable. I have a message for Washington Republicans. Get to work! This is now not funny anymore -- straight ahead.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So as the left continues their Russia collusion conspiracy hysteria, well, The Hill was the first to report that the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump, Jr., last summer was allowed into the U.S. under, quote, ""extraordinary circumstances"" by, yes, the Justice Department in the Obama administration.

Here with reaction, editor-in-chief, Lifezette, Fox News contributor, nationally syndicated rock star radio host, Laura Ingraham. How are you?

LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'm great. Thanks, Sean.

HANNITY: OK, why did they let her in? Why does she get the special exemption? And she was supposed to have been out of the country by then. Is that a big deal?

INGRAHAM: Well, I think questions have to be asked. I'm glad Chuck Grassley and others are asking our immigration officials how this happened.

It isn't all that unusual for people who are legitimate lawyers representing clients with interests in the United States to get access to this country. However, if, in fact, this woman is connected to the Russian government and is essentially acting as, you know, some type of Russian agent for the Russian government, then I think that's a different matter. But we don't know that yet.

And I think it's really smart of Congress to get all of the documents, especially given what we know and what you've been talking about this Fusion GPS group that is a Democrat-funded organization that, of course, she worked with.

HANNITY: That's connected with the dossier.

INGRAHAM: All right, connected -- connected with the dossier, which included all this supposedly damning information about Donald Trump. So we need all these questions answered. And I think before people go completely hysterical on the Donald Trump, Jr., case, which, of course, is what cable is doing 24/7, at least ask these questions.

I mean, this woman -- you want to hang his supposed complicity with a potential collaboration with Russia to hurt Hillary Clinton, and yet there are lots of questions about who she really is and what interests she was representing vis-a-vis this Magnitsky Act that froze the assets of certain Russian officials after the torture of Sergei Magnitsky in prison. So...

(CROSSTALK)

HANNITY: ... let me ask you this. All right, so between the dossier issue, which is the Fusion GPS connection...

INGRAHAM: Yes.

HANNITY: ... and then you've got, of course, the influencing -- Obama trying to defeat Bibi Netanyahu -- I thought it was bad to try and influence elections. But more importantly, all the evidence of Ukrainian involvement to support Hillary and a paid DNC staffer reporting back information after embassy meetings with the Ukraine ambassador, seems like there's far more evidence, Laura. Nobody seems to pay attention to it but people like us.

INGRAHAM: Oh, I think...

HANNITY: That to me is a far bigger story with more evidence.

INGRAHAM: I think again, the congressional committees, which we keep hearing, Sean, are -- are not going to be partisan in how they look at these issues -- they're going to be -- play it straight down the middle. It's not going to be partisan. I keep hearing that from the Senate and the House side.

OK, if that's the case, then we need to get to the bottom of Ms. Veselnitskaya's immigration status, exactly what John McCain's, you know, connection to this dossier was. We want to get to the bottom of the leaks and whether the leaks are coming out of the National Security Council, leaks are coming out of the FBI, leaks are coming out of -- of course, from James Comey and how he delivered memos to his friend to deliver them to The New York Times -- I mean, we want answers to all of this.

If this is really going to be a comprehensive report on what happened and everything in the aftermath, then it better be comprehensive. But I have my doubts.

HANNITY: OK, then the next -- then on top of those people being put under oath, don't we need to -- and I was asking this in the last segment of Jay -- I'm sorry, of Gregg Jarrett.

INGRAHAM: Yes.

HANNITY: Don't we also need to investigate Hillary Clinton now and James Comey now and the deep state now, and we can't have unequal application of the laws in this country when we know the evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible?

INGRAHAM: Yes, I think -- I think we still don't know, Sean, for instance, what countries were trying to gain access to her e-mail files, to her unsecured private server, which we heard was not as secure as a regular Gmail account. We know that her staffer, one of her staffers or IT guys, told her that they were very worried that someone was trying to hack into her system. Well, who did? Who got into her system, if anyone? You know, what happened with the integrity of those e-mails?

We never even got answers to that. And so could it have been Russia? Could have been China, could have been -- could have been other bad actors? But she actually made her entire government filing system vulnerable. She willfully did that, and then I would say endangering potentially national security in the process.

HANNITY: We know...

INGRAHAM: So she did that. That was a concerted effort that she made to keep her information separate, the Clinton Foundation, all of that. They wanted that revolving door of access kept separate, and they hoped, private. Well, we never really got the answers to that, did we.

HANNITY: Such a good point. And five foreign intelligence services 99.9 percent likelihood got that information.

INGRAHAM: Yes.

HANNITY: And the real Russia conspiracy is the $145-plus million kickback the Uranium One -- the sign-off on her part. But Laura, good to see you. Thank you.

INGRAHAM: Good to see you.

HANNITY: All right, when we come back, Lou Dobbs joins us next with reaction to all of this left-wing hypocrisy, media hypocrisy.

And also later tonight...

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ANDERSON COOPER, CNN: I think it's funny that you have enough time in the White House, which is apparently, you're so buys, you're able to sit around and read Nielsen numbers.

(CROSSTALK)

SEBASTIAN GORKA, DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: I get really good prep for my team because the White House press team is superb.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: Dr. Sebastian Gorka and his takedown of CNN. We've got two instances to play you. We'll get reaction from Joe Concha and Kaya Jones (ph). Please stay with us as we continue.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening and live from America's news headquarters, I'm Jackie Ibanez in New York.

President Trump and the first lady wrapping up their first day in Paris with a dinner at the Eiffel Tower. They capped the day of meetings at a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. Tomorrow they'll all attend the Bastille Day parade which this year falls on the 100th anniversary of the entry of the American troops into World War I.

A Pennsylvania drug dealer confessing to killing four young men after selling them marijuana. There he is. A person with firsthand knowledge of his confession telling the Associated Press that he then burned their bodies at his family's Bucks County farm. The victims who went missing last week were between the ages of 19 and 22.

Former President Jimmy Carter was taken to the hospital today as a precaution. The 92-year-old Carter became dehydrated at a Habitat for Humanity construction project in Canada.

I'm Jackie Ibanez. Now back to ""Hannity."" For all your headlines, long on to FoxNews.com.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: My son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer but a Russian lawyer. I think from a practical standpoint most people would've taken that meeting. It's called opposition research, or even research into your opponent.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: That was President Trump earlier today, he was in Paris responding to a question about Don Jr. meeting with a Russian lawyer last summer. Here with reaction, author of the new book ""Putin's Gambit,"" from the Fox Business Network, our friend Lou Dobbs is back with us.

I just outlined in great detail the Ukrainian issue of influence, real collusion. Then of course you've got the British intel dossier, and Comey wanted to pay the guy with false information, and he was paying for the information. But that's not what we hear about. What do you make of the double standard?

LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: The double standard is more than that I think, Sean, by a long measure. This is an effort to subvert the administration and President Donald Trump. It is nothing less. It is an effort by the deep state to roll over a duly elected president and a legitimate government, and to break the will of the American people.

This is no longer about Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals. This is about a full on assault by the left, the Democratic Party, to absolutely carry out a coup d'etat against President Trump, aided by the leftwing media. There's no -- the suggestion there's collusion between Trump and the Russians, when we have absolute evidence of collusion between the Clinton Foundation, Secretary of State Clinton and the Russians? What does it take?

HANNITY: I don't know what it takes, but we've had 125 deep state leaks in 126 days. Every one of them I would say needs to be investigated for being a felony. I think the only way this works is the deep state gets purged, number one. Obama holdovers get purged, that still has not happened.

The next thing is the laws of the country that apply to every American watching us now, Lou, need to apply to Hillary, need to apply to Comey, need to apply to Attorney General Lynch, and anyone else who leaked information within the deep state. If we don't hold them accountable then it never stops.

DOBBS: You're exactly right. And by the way, the evidence is recent history. Over the course of the last month we have watched those leaks accelerate in point of fact from the West Wing, the White House itself, instead of abate. And we have a Justice Department, where is Attorney General Jeff Sessions? This is a time for the attorney general to stand up and say this is not going to be tolerated, and this is what is going to occur. We are opening investigations into the Clinton Foundation to Uranium One and 20 percent of uranium production that was transferred ultimately to the Russians. That's collusion.

HANNITY: But the question is I don't know any other antidote than to purge the deep state, to apply the law equally. And if you don't, then you are giving license for all of this to continue.

DOBBS: I do think we should, as you say, apply the law equally, but just to apply the law randomly to Democrats would be such a massive improvement, an order of magnitude better than what we have now. We have President Trump being investigated by a special counsel, and there isn't even a crime called collusion. Bob Mueller doesn't have any basis in legal --

HANNITY: We're going to have investigative creep. He's going to use Hillary's attorney to go further and further and set traps.

DOBBS: You know what, Sean, it's interesting to hear the leftwing national media's narrative changing. This is going to be, quote-unquote, the new normal for two or three years as the Trump administration is investigative. They are actually saying that.

HANNITY: Four years, Lou. Four. It will be four.

DOBBS: I think you're right. It should be stopped here.

HANNITY: I've got to roll. Lou Dobbs on our sister network, the FOX Business Network every night, 7:00 eastern. Thank you, sir.

And when we come back on this busy breaking news night tonight right here on HANNITY.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: You've heard reporting that there's bunker mode in parts of the White House as the news of Donald Trump Jr. broke. I want you to be able to comment on that.

DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: Oh, absolutely. It's laughable.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: The Sebastian Gorka beat down of CNN, and CNN continues their smear campaign against President Trump. You've got to watch this. If you missed it, we will play it for you, and we will get reaction, by the way, from Joe Concha and Kaya Jones. And also tonight --

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: Number one, repeal and replace. I am sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand waiting for our senators to give it to me.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: You Republicans in D.C., the American people elected you to do a job. Get to work. I have a message for you tonight. And by the way, our mini monologue, that's straight ahead. And also I'll hold Washington accountable

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So the so-called journalists over at fake news CNN, they have been wall-to-wall anti-Trump coverage. They can't stop. It's like a drug to them. Last night, the deputy assistant to the president, our friend, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, he went into the belly of the beast and completely owned Anderson Cooper. If you haven't seen it, it's must watch TV. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: You've heard reporting that there's bunker mode in parts of the White House as the news of Donald Trump Jr. broke. I want you to be able to comment on that.

DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: Oh, absolutely. It's laughable. Your chyron talked about the crisis, your reporter talked about a bunker mentality. I actually work in the West Wing, I work in the White House. It is absolutely nothing of the kind.

I know you want salacious, sensational coverage for your ratings so your corporate sponsors and owners will have more money, but that's not media. That's not reportage. It's just fake news.

COOPER: I'm just going to ignore the insults because I don't think it gets us anywhere.

GORKA: Is not about you. It's about actually having journalism back on TV.

Let's let the viewers judge, who decided that you are now 13th place and national ratings behind ""Nick at Night,"" which is on at 11:00.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: By the way, Dr. Gorka is right. They are losing to Yogi Bear reruns. Hey, Boo-boo. By the way, here's another exchange that Gorka had with our former colleague Alisyn Camerata, who now works at CNN. This is tough to watch. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

GORKA: The amount of time you spend a desperation on a topic that has plummeted to you to 13th place in viewership ranking across America, more people watch ""Nick at Night"" cartoons than CNN today.

ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: Our ratings are doing just fine. If you want to go there, our ratings are doing just fine. Ratings represent if people are interested in this.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: Here now with reaction, media reporter with ""The Hill"" Joe Concha, recording artist, entrepreneur Kaya Jones. Kaya, it just so happens Dr. Gorka is right. Hey, Boo-boo, let's get a pic-a-nic basket is out-rating CNN. It's just a fact.

KAYA JONES, RECORDING ARTIST AND ENTREPRENEUR: Chip and Joanna Gaines reruns are doing better than CNN and Anderson Cooper.

(LAUGHTER)

HANNITY: What do you think of the exchange?

JONES: I think that it's good. I think that Gorka is doing great by going after the narrative of what they are trying to do. We need to discredit the fact that this is fake news. And the only way to do that is to pull the numbers. Let's show really what's going on. And this whole narrative of Donald Trump Jr. and the Russians saying -- Hillary Clinton actually has done things with our uranium, 20 percent at $140 million, tens of millions of dollars going into the Clinton Foundation, and those are facts. Is anyone investigating that? Who even gave the story to ""The New York Times"" about Donald Trump Jr.?

HANNITY: Joe, what's your take? You really do stand apart. I notice you're not a part of the humpty-dumpty cabal on Twitter and social media, and you stand independent. What is your take on it objectively?

JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL: In terms of the Gorka exchange with Anderson Cooper, well, Sean, the way I saw it was he was taking issue with the CNN report about the White House being in a bunker mentality. Here's where the White House has been in terms of a bunker mentality over the last couple of days. You have the press conference doing a joint -- excuse me, the president doing a joint press conference with the president of France. You have him doing interviews with Reuters and CBN yesterday. You have Kellyanne Conway doing multiple interviews across the spectrum. Jay Sekulow I think for most records in one day in terms of interviews on ABC, CBS, NBC, and obviously Gorka has been active as well. So that's not a bunker mentality.

But here's where I took issue with that interview. Anderson Cooper at one point scolded Sebastian Gorka and said, ""I'm just going to ignore the insults because I don't think it really gets us anywhere."" And in the post interview analysis, after Gorka was off that interview where he couldn't defend himself, Anderson Cooper, who is an anchor, the face of that network and the highest-paid person there who should act like a professional, called Gorka the Hungarian Don Rickles. So that is where things are getting personal. It's no longer about anything else but hurling an insult where a guy can't defend himself. And by the way, if you're going to insult somebody, don't bring up Don Rickles. He just died three months ago. He was beloved. Find another example besides a beloved entertainer like Mr. Rickles.

HANNITY: Remember what he said to my friend Jeffrey Lord over there. Are they able to recover their brand, Kaya? You know a lot about branding.

JONES: Yes. I don't know. Anderson Cooper, he's a Vanderbilt. His narrative and the amount of money that he has made --

HANNITY: He's a Vanderbilt. I'm talking about the CNN brand.

JONES: Come on, maybe he can help them out financially because they're going down.

HANNITY: That's probably true. Does Jeff Zucker survive considering he's driven this network into the ground, Joe?

CONCHA: I think the advertising revenue is still pretty good, Sean. Obviously 13th in total viewership is not where you want to be. You don't want to be trailing episodes of ""Full House"" which is a show that came on the year 30 years ago, and the Olson twins are actually in their 30s, which makes you feel kind of old.

So they're going to have to turn things around clearly and get the CNN that we had during the Gulf Wars and just doing that kind of reportage instead of focusing on one topic so much. Harvard study, Sean, I brought it up. I'll bring it up again, 93 percent of all coverage on CNN is negative toward the Trump administration. That is a number you cannot spin.

HANNITY: Thank you, guys. We'll take a break. When we come back, this is up next tonight right here on HANNITY.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: Number one, repeal and replace. I am sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand waiting for our senators to give it to me.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: The president is right, Republicans, they have been promising you, the American people, since 2010 they would repeal and replace ObamaCare. I have a message for Washington Republicans -- get your act together. That is next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Today a revised health care draft was released by Senate Republicans, so will GOP lawmakers finally after seven years uphold their promise and repeal and replace ObamaCare? Tonight we're holding Washington accountable, and it is the subject of our mini monologue.

The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell has cancelled -- good start -- the first two weeks of the Senate's August recess, and he says he may vote on the bill next week. I'll believe it when I see it.

Senator Ted Cruz said that he will support the bill as long as it drives down the cost of premiums, that's key. So will that happen?

Some of the key provisions and revisions to the released bill included billions of dollars to combat opioid addiction, additional funding for insurers, covering a high risk pool. It also allows premiums to be paid with pretax health savings accounts. That's important. And still some senators are still skeptical that this revamped legislation will ever even see the light of day.

Earlier today before the revised plan was released, here's Senator John McCain -- you know, the guy involved in that dossier thing -- this is what he said earlier.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, R-ARIZ.: It should have gone through the committees of oversight so that the Democrats had a role to play, and then we probably could've gotten this thing done. Now I think prospects are dim. But it is what it is.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: And Republican Senator Susan Collins went a step further and vowed not to support the bill. She tweeted out, ""Still deep cuts in Medicaid in the Senate bill. Will vote no on a motion to proceed. Ready to work with the GOP and Democratic colleagues to fix the flaws in the ACA.""

Remember, these are the same pathetic, weak Republicans, spineless Republican senators -- they vowed to completely repeal and replace ObamaCare. They said give us the House in 2010, give us the Senate in 2014. Give us the presidency in 2016, we'll get this done, remember?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)

SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY., JUNE 28, 2012: There's only one way to truly fix ObamaCare, only one way, and that's a full repeal. A full repeal, that's been our goal from the start, that's our goal now, and we plan to achieve it.

MCCAIN, DEC. 3, 2015: It's clear that any serious attempt to improve our health care system must begin with full repeal and replacement of ObamaCare, a mission I remain fully committed to fighting on behalf of the people of Arizona.

SEN. SUSAN COLLINS, R-MAINE, NOV. 14, 2013: Repealing ObamaCare's poorly crafted and misguided mandates and replacing the law with a fiscally responsible reform bill that contains costs and provides more choices is the best path forward.

SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C., MARCH 31, 2014: You can't repair this monstrosity. You've got to tear it down and start all over again.

JENNA LEE, CO-HOST, ""HAPPENING NOW"": How do you get to that point, though?

GRAHAM: When they lose elections.

LEE: And you think that's key, that the Republicans have to take the Senate, and from that point you can have a different strategy?

GRAHAM: Yes, the ones who survive in 2016, are up in 2016 are going to have a different attitude.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: If you can't replace it, then do what you said, repeal it. You have no excuses left. You have the House, the Senate, the presidency.

President Trump had this to say about the bill in an interview with Pat Robertson yesterday.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, ""THE 700 CLUB""/CBN)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Number one, repeal and replace. I am sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand waiting for our senators to give it to me. For years, they've been talking about repeal and replace, repeal and replace. I think they passed up to 61 times, repeal and replace. But that didn't mean anything because you had the minority, the Republicans, they didn't have the majority so it wasn't going to get to the president, and if it ever did Obama wasn't going to sign it. So it didn't mean -- now we have a president that's waiting to sign it.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: Sixth-one times -- I have a message for all of you in Washington. You know what? You cannot give up on repealing the quote ""Affordable Care Act."" You made us a promise, the American people, for seven years. You guaranteed you'd end ObamaCare. You assured all of us you would develop a health care bill that actually worked for the American people.

Stop your whining, roll up your sleeves, get to work, put your egos aside, get it done. You were elected to lead. Make tough decisions. Get this thing over the finish line and do it for the American people. And stop with the vacations. They didn't elect you to capitulate and whine and complain and fall down on your face. This is pathetic. Do your job.

And up next tonight on ""Hannity.""

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TERRENCE WILLIAMS, COMEDIAN: So since the mainstream media want to bring up emails, let's bring up Hillary Clinton's deleted 33,000 emails. You all got to mention it now.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: Social media Twitter sensation Terrence Williams, he gets the last word as he has all week, tonight with us straight ahead.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" Time once again for social media, Twitter sensation, our friend Terrance Williams. He gets the last word. We have been doing this with Terrence all week. Hope you are enjoying it. He is just funny. Watch this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TERRENCE WILLIAMS, COMEDIAN: So since the mainstream media want to bring up emails, let's bring up Hillary Clinton's deleted 33,000 emails. You all got to mention it now. You all want to act like boo-boo the foo-foo when it comes to that.

(LAUGHTER)

WILLIAMS: Hypocrite. But you all want to bring up Donald J. Trump Jr. releasing his emails. At least he was real enough to do that, unlike crooked Hillary who deleted 33,000 emails. I can't even get through 100 of my Yahoo! emails in six months, so I don't know how that old master crook did it.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: You've got to love Terrance, and you can catch him on social media. He is rip-roaring, make-you-cry funny.

All right, that's all the time we have left this evening. As always, thank you for being with us. Remember, on this program, we will always be fair and balanced. Thanks for being with us. See you back here tomorrow night.

GOP OBAMACARE HOPES HANG ON CRUZ PLAN

Skydivers say you should always pack your own parachute. But Senate Republicans are about to hop out of their airplane with one packed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

Wheeeeeeeeeee…

For a guy who has been called the “most hated man in Congress,” this is not probably the expected course of events, even for Cruz. But here we are.

Many Republicans were leery of Cruz being included in the working group that drafted the original legislation that flopped just before Independence Day. Those suspicions seem to be borne out when Cruz joined a claque of fellow conservatives to oppose the legislation.

If the idea was to keep the stream of Cruz’s micturition directed outward from the GOP tent, why was he making water inside the flaps?

Today may provide us the answer. Cruz’s proposal to allow a two-tiered system for health insurance regulations – in which insurance companies would still be required to offer plans with more lavish benefits but would be allowed bare-bones policies as well – made it into the new version of the Senate bill.

The cynical among you might conclude that this was a set-up in which Cruz, by objecting to the first draft, can now play pied piper for skeptical conservatives.

But it is probably simpler than that. Cruz’s bargaining power was enhanced by the failure of the first version, and so he found himself in a better position. Whether or not other conservatives see the inclusion of Cruz’s plan as enough, we don’t know yet.

The Cruz plan would achieve a long-sought goal on the right of rolling back ObamaCare regulations and invigorate the preferred conservative policy prescription of allowing younger, lower-wage workers to obtain stripped down, catastrophic coverage and then pay for regular medical services from a tax-free account.

But the new plan also comes with a lot more spending and more taxes than the original draft.

There is more money for Medicaid and $70 billion more in subsidies. All told, there seems to be about $230 billion in increased spending over the next decade compared to the first version, money obtained from keeping ObamaCare taxes on top earners and investors.

So while there is much for moderates to like, the Cruz provision is sure to be controversial. The concern ardently expressed by the insurance industry is that if healthy consumers are allowed to buy cheaper plans, older, sicker customers will be stuck under the old system and the “death spiral” we have already seen playing out in government-run insurance exchanges will badly intensify.

Will the new spending be enough to offset those concerns? A slightly different, yet still similar approach in the House of deregulation offset by additional spending eventually made it over the finish line. That’s pretty clearly the hope here.

But the arithmetic in the Senate is less forgiving than in the House. Think of it this way, House Speaker Paul Ryan could afford to lose almost 10 percent of Republican members and still pass his bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell only has 4 percent to spare.

Remember also that failure is an option for many members on the Senate side. Conservatives don’t want to vote for legislation that maintains the framework of ObamaCare. Moderates don’t want to vote for cuts to Medicaid and stingier coverage rules.

Both sides know that this legislation failing means having to take up, with the help of Democrats, a plan to patch the program for the coming year. If the current bill fails, conservatives can leave it to moderates and Democrats to pass the patch and go home to voters with clean hands but still know that calamity has been averted.

The same goes for moderates in this sense, many of them would rather work with Democrats on patching the existing law for a year instead of having to swallow legislation that could prove to be damaging not just in 2018 but in several cycles beyond that. They need only ask their Democratic counterparts how long the ObamaCare hangover lasted.

This approach of strategic failure is how congressional Republicans operated throughout their years of majority when a Democrat was in the White House. Perhaps they will simply revert to form even in majority.

Republican leaders are hoping that the Cruz-packed parachute, when it unfurls fully next week with a budget score, will be enough to save them from a hard landing.



THE RULEBOOK: NO HIDING IT

“But whatever may be our situation, whether firmly united under one national government, or split into a number of confederacies, certain it is, that foreign nations will know and view it exactly as it is; and they will act toward us accordingly.” – John Jay, Federalist No. 4

TIME OUT: THE WAY WE’LL WORK

NYT: “True Story [card game and mobile app] was a case study in what two Stanford professors call ‘flash organizations’ — ephemeral setups to execute a single, complex project in ways traditionally associated with corporations, nonprofit groups or governments. The professors, Melissa Valentine and Michael Bernstein, contend that information technology has made the flash organization a suddenly viable form across a number of industries. And, in fact, intermediaries are already springing up across industries like software and pharmaceuticals to assemble such organizations. … But to the extent that temporary organizations replace permanent ones, they have the potential to add to the economic uncertainty that workers must increasingly contend with. … In principle, many companies would find it more cost-effective to increase staff members as needed than to maintain a permanent presence. The reason they do not, economists have long argued, is that the mechanics of hiring, training and monitoring workers separately for each project can be prohibitively expensive.”

TRUMP DEFENDS SON ON RUSSIA: ‘VERY STANDARD IN POLITICS’

WashEx: “President Trump defended his son’s decision to accept a meeting last year with a Russian lawyer, and argued the media has made a ‘very big deal’ out of a routine research-gathering discussion. ‘My son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer, but a Russian lawyer,’ Trump said during a joint appearance with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Thursday. ‘It was a short meeting, it was a meeting that went very, very quickly, very fast.’ ‘I do think this, I think from a practical standpoint, most people would have taken that meeting. It’s called opposition research,’ Trump said. … ‘I’ve had many people call up [and say] ‘Oh, gee, we have information on this factor or this person or, frankly, Hillary.’ That’s very standard in politics,’ Trump said. ‘In the case of Don... I guess they talked about, as I see it, they talked about adoption and some things,’ Trump said.”

Grassley wants Donald Jr. to testify - NPR: “Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, tells NPR that he has sent a letter to Donald J. Trump Jr. saying that he wants the president’s son to testify in an open session of the committee as early as next week and will subpoena him if necessary.”

Russian officials overheard discussing trump associates before campaign - WSJ: “Investigators are re-examining conversations detected by U.S. intelligence agencies in spring 2015 that captured Russian government officials discussing associates of Donald Trump… Russian officials are routinely monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies, and it wouldn’t be unusual for them to discuss people who have business interests in Russia. … The 2015 conversations were detected several months before Mr. Trump declared his candidacy for the White House. The conversations have been in investigators’ possession for some time, but officials said the Donald Trump Jr. news this week prompted them to look at them again.”

Senate Dems turn fire toward Kushner over Trump Jr. meeting - Politico: “White House senior adviser Jared Kushner is facing mounting backlash from Senate Democrats for participating in a controversial meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign, with lawmakers calling for his security clearance to be revoked and questioning his place in the Trump administration. … Sen. Chris Murphy on Wednesday reportedly called for Kushner to resign, saying Trump's son-in-law had either misled the president — who has repeatedly denied contact with Russia — or a larger plot was afoot within the Trump White House.”

Democrats ask DOJ about settlement involving Trump-linked lawyer - Bloomberg: “Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee asked the Justice Department to explain a decision to settle a money-laundering case in May that involved the Russian lawyer who held a controversial meeting last year with Donald Trump Jr. Democrats are interested because one of the lawyers involved in the case was Natalia Veselnitskaya …Veselnitskaya worked with a Cyprus-based company, Prevezon Holdings Ltd. that is controlled by a Russian businessman and was accused of a tax theft and money laundering scheme.”

What about that? - Try this thought experiment from Jonathan Last. Weekly Standard: “So before you come to any initial conclusions about Donald Trump Jr.’s don’t-call-it-collusion with the Russians, put the situation to the Earth 2 Test: If Clinton were president and you saw an email from the campaign where Chelsea had been informed that the Russian government had damaging information about Trump … would you think it was all just an overblown media story that didn’t matter?”



MON AMI! TRUMP, MACRON FEEL THE LOVE IN PARIS

Daily Telegraph [U.K.]: “US President Donald Trump suggested Thursday he could change his position on the Paris climate accord, in remarks after talks with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. ‘Something could happen with respect to the Paris accord,’ he said at a joint news conference with Mr. Macron six weeks after announcing that the United States would abandon the 2015 pact, adding: ‘We'll see what happens.’ Mr. Macron told the conference he ‘respected’ his US counterpart's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord but that France remained committed to the 2015 pact.”

HOMELAND BOSS: LAWSUITS COULD DOOM ‘DREAMERS’

WaPo: “Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly told the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in a closed-door meeting Wednesday that an initiative that grants work permits to more than 800,000 undocumented immigrants may not survive a looming legal challenge. Kelly declined to take questions after the meeting, but his spokesman said the secretary told the members that the Obama-era program, which shields immigrants brought to the United States as children, is at risk. ‘This is what he’s being told by different attorneys, that if it goes to court it might not survive,’ DHS spokesman David Lapan said. If Congress does not pass a bill to protect the program, he added, ‘they’re leaving it in the hands of the courts to make a decision.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“You said in [Wednesday’s] Halftime Report that Natalia Veselnitskaya was working for the Russian government but both she and the Kremlin both say she has no government connection. As of 2016, the US had over 1.3 million attorney, I don't think they all work for the US government... isn't it possible that not every Russian attorney work for the government?” – Larry Roland, Todd, N.C.

[Ed. note: The issue there, Mr. Roland, wasn’t what Veselnitskaya actually is but what the president’s eldest son thought she was when he eagerly agreed to the meeting. There’s no question that she is well connected to the Russian mobocracy and the oligarch friends of Vladimir Putin who have worked hard to get tough sanctions imposed by the West lifted. But that doesn’t really matter. We can only take the word of the participants in the meeting that it amounted to nothing and that, unlike the promise made to Donald Trump Jr. she did not really have damaging information via the Kremlin.]

“What would happen if Trump supporters eliminated their local newspapers for a month or more OR stopped watching main stream TV news – do you think there would be consequences? All that advertising revenue disappearing – it may be the only way to send a strong message that we won’t tolerate ‘fake news’ any longer…” – Delores Chantra, Westlake Village, Calif.



[Ed. note: Well, one thing that would surely happen is that people would be more ill-informed about local events. I am a huge proponent of local newspapers and local digital news platforms. The paramount mission for Americans today is to rebuild their own communities and strengthen their sense of connectedness to their own neighborhoods and neighbors. Part of the reason that people are so disappointed in the federal government is that the flow of information runs like a torrent through Washington, New York and Hollywood but is a mere trickle in many communities. The rise of the internet has severely damaged one of the most important parts of our republic: reliable purveyors of local news. It’s important to know what Congress is doing or what the president says, but probably not as important as knowing what your county commissioners, state legislators and other officials closer to home are doing.]



“So just what does the CBO project happens under the ACA, if there are no changes? The system as it stands now is collapsing! Are those 22 million people (and millions more) going to have access to anything at all if ACA remains unchanged, what with insurance companies withdrawing from the marketplace because of adverse selection? As always, I enjoy your repartee!” – David Zick, Bingham Farms, Mich.

[Ed. note: Pity the poor Congressional Budget Office. What they can and cannot do is tightly proscribed by Congressional rules, and that means they can only score actual legislation and they must offer projections on a 10-year basis, even though they would tell you that a decade is a long time to try to predict the social psychology of consumers and changes to any market. That said, everybody knows what happens next year if something isn’t done about the existing law. That’s why Republicans are sweating and Democrats are delighted. ObamaCare may have been their idea, but the Blue Team is enjoying watching Republicans’ anguish.]

BUT DID THEY CHARGE HIM A $3 FEE FOR WITHDRAWAL?

KRISTV: “Police say a contractor was working on changing a lock inside a room that connects to the ATM around 2:00 p.m. Wednesday afternoon. Officer [Richard] Olden says, ‘he leaves his phone in his truck, he's installing a new lock on the door, and he gets locked inside the building where the ATM is.’ Since the ATM still works, people were stopping by to get cash, and the contractor decided to slip out notes through the receipt slot stating, ‘Please Help. I'm stuck in here, and I don't have my phone. Please call my boss.’ Officer Olden said people thought it was a joke, but someone took it seriously and called the police. ‘We come out here, and sure enough we can hear a little voice coming from the machine. So we are thinking this is a joke. It's got to be a joke,’ Olden said. … Later the contractor supervisor arrived, and police had to kick down a door to get the gentlemen out of the ATM room. Olden says, ‘Everyone is okay, but you will never see this in your life, that somebody was stuck in the ATM, it was just crazy.’”

Krauthammer: 'Incompetence is Not a Good Defense' for Don Jr.

Jay Sekulow, an attorney representing President Donald Trump, told Sean Hannity that there is ""no illegality"" in Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer.

Trump Jr. was informed in a series of emails that attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya would offer him compromising information about Hillary Clinton in the June 2016 meeting.

Trump Jr. said nothing came from the meeting and he was unaware that Veselnitskaya was possibly Kremlin-connected.

On Tuesday, Trump Jr. released what he said was the “entire email chain” of conversations setting up the meeting.

Sekulow pointed out that Trump Jr. was completely transparent in releasing the emails, unlike Hillary Clinton, who deleted thousands of emails from her government email account as secretary of state.

He added that nothing actually transpired in the meeting with Veselnitskaya, which was also attended by then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior aide.

""There's a media frenzy on Russia now. This has been going on for several months. But when you look to see what actually took place, a meeting takes place, nothing happens as a result of this 15 or 20 minute meeting, and at the end of the day, there's no illegality.""

He said as an attorney, he can't see which statute or code section of U.S. law could possibly have been violated.

""Some of the theories that some of the commentators have put forward are ridiculous,"" Sekulow said. ""There was no illegality in that meeting. And on top of that, there was no information that was obtained.""

TRUMP KEEPS UP CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL

WaPo: “President Trump renewed his attacks on Attorney General Jeff Sessions Wednesday, questioning on Twitter why the top U.S. law enforcement official had not replaced the acting FBI director – a move that Trump himself has the authority to do. In two tweets just before 10 a.m., Trump wrote, ‘Why didn’t A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation but got big dollars ($700,000) for his wife’s political run from Hillary Clinton and her representatives. Drain the Swamp!’ Trump has for days been attacking his attorney general, and he has similarly been critical of McCabe, who took over as the acting director of the FBI after Trump fired James B. Comey. But his latest attack is curious.”

Peace offering? Sessions to unveil results of leak probe - Fox News colleague Jake Gibson has the story. Fox News: “Attorney General Jeff Sessions will soon announce several criminal leak investigations, Fox News has learned. A U.S. official familiar with the discussions said Tuesday that the planned announcement surrounding stepped-up efforts on leak investigations has ‘been in the works for some time and will most likely happen sometime in the next week.’ … The investigations will look at news reports that publicized sensitive intelligence material, according to officials who have been briefed on the matter.”



Trump, Sessions said to not be on speaking terms - Politico: “Donald Trump is playing an elaborate game of chicken with Jeff Sessions. And they are not on speaking terms. Sessions has sent word to the White House that he has no plans to resign and wants to stay as attorney general even amid daily humiliation from the boss, according to two people familiar with his thinking. But he hasn't told Trump that himself.”



Tillerson ‘taking a little time off’ but not resigning - The Hill: “State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert flatly denied rumors on Tuesday that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is planning his departure from the agency but noted that he serves ‘at the pleasure of the president.’”

Jonah Goldberg: Conservatives face harsh reality in Trump v. Sessions - National Review: “…there was a time when the case for Trump among many conservatives rested to a significant degree on Sessions’s support for him. Now, the case against Sessions rests entirely on Trump’s lack of support for the attorney general. Sessions, for good or ill, has not changed. The only thing that’s changed is Trump’s ‘interests.’ I put interests in quotes because I think, objectively speaking, it is not in his interest to fire Sessions or force him to quit.”

Nate Silver: Sessions firing would set up collision with Congress -FiveThirtyEight: “President Trump’s outburst against Attorney General Jeff Sessions might be the event that forces a confrontation with congressional Republicans over the Russia scandal. If Sessions is fired or resigns under pressure, the Senate will have to confirm his replacement. And if Trump nominates as Sessions’s successor someone such as Rudy Giuliani, who is seen by some as insufficiently independent from Trump or as likely to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, the moment may finally be upon Republicans in Congress to signal how far they’re willing to go to check Trump’s powers.”

LAT: “President Trump’s former campaign chairman will not be testifying [today] before the Senate Judiciary Committee, as originally scheduled, after the committee rescinded its subpoena. The committee withdrew its subpoena for Paul Manafort late Tuesday after Manafort agreed to turn over documents and to continue negotiating about setting up an interview with the panel… The committee also removed Donald Trump Jr. from the list of witnesses scheduled for Wednesday's public hearing. … On Tuesday, Manafort met with Senate Intelligence Committee staff, providing his recollection of [a meeting arranged with Russian operatives by Trump Jr.] and agreeing to turn over contemporaneous notes of the gathering last year, according to people familiar with the closed-door interview.”

Dems delay hearing for Putin foe - Fox News: “Bill Browder, the CEO and co-founder of Hermitage Capital, was set to tell the Senate Judiciary Committee that the co-founder of the firm Fusion GPS was hired to conduct a ‘smear campaign’ against him. Further, he planned to testify the campaign was orchestrated by Natalia Veselnitskaya-- the Russian attorney who sought the highly scrutinized Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort in June 2016. Browder released written testimony ahead of the hearing but his public remarks were delayed when Democrats invoked the ‘two-hour rule’ to protest Republican efforts to repeal ObamaCare. The seldom-used rule bars committees from meeting more than two hours after the full Senate begins a session. Browder now is expected to testify Thursday…”

Co-founder of firm tied to Trump dossier agrees to speak to Senate panel - The Hill: “The co-founder of the firm tied to the controversial opposition research dossier on President Trump has agreed to speak to the Senate Judiciary Committee behind closed doors, the top lawmakers on the panel said Tuesday. In exchange for the interview, the committee will drop its subpoena of Glenn Simpson, co-founder of the Washington-based strategy firm Fusion GPS. The subpoena was issued last week after Simpson declined the committee's request to appear before lawmakers in a public hearing.”

Russia warns of ‘painful’ response if Trump signs U.S. sanctions - Bloomberg: “Russia threatened to retaliate against new sanctions passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, saying they made it all but impossible to achieve the Trump administration’s goal of improved relations. The measures push U.S.-Russia ties into uncharted territory and ‘don’t leave room for the normalization of relations’ in the foreseeable future, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Wednesday, according to the Interfax news service.”

“There are appearances to authorize a supposition that the adventurous spirit, which distinguishes the commercial character of America, has already excited uneasy sensations in several of the maritime powers of Europe.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 11

TIME OUT: GHOST STORY

Writer Carson Vaughan considers the work of a rediscovered frontier photographer. Paris Review: “My grandparents lived in a massive two-story home with creaking pinewood floors and lace curtains that hung like ghosts from the windows. … But it’s the second floor hallway that still crops up in my dreams. My distant relatives lingered on that floor, hanging from the burgundy walls in black and white. None of them smiled. They never slept. They stared at me. They sat upright in wooden chairs in front of their soddies, surrounded by the trappings of their frontier existence… Their lives seemed tiny and brutally sincere, swallowed by the grass and sand of Custer County, Nebraska, a land so vast and so empty it appears often dimensionless in the photos. … I don’t remember any formal introduction to the pioneer photographer Solomon D. Butcher… In fact, for the longest time, I didn’t consider the guiding hand behind these photos at all. They just were.”

SCOREBOARD

Trump net job-approval rating: -18 points

Change from one week ago: down 1.4 points



[President Trump’s score is determined by subtracting his average job disapproval rating in the five most recent, methodologically sound public polls from his average approval rating, calculated in the same fashion.]

SENATE GOP LOOKS FOR ‘POLITICAL PUNT’ ON OBAMACARE

Politico: “Now the Senate GOP is aiming for what Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price called the ‘lowest common denominator’ as its likely end game: repealing Obamacare’s individual and employer mandates as well as its tax on medical devices. Though the contents of that so-called ‘skinny repeal’ could still change, but those three elements may be all the Senate can pass at this point. Sen. Lindsey Graham(R-S.C.) on Tuesday called the possibility of a skeletal plan a ‘political punt,’ but it may be that that can clear the narrowly divided chamber.”

Narrow path for passage after procedural victory - WaPo: “Senators will next cast an up-or-down vote on whether to completely repeal Obamacare. The vote could come as early as today. It will fail. The only question is how many Republicans vote against it. Two years ago, all but one of them voted for the identical measure — when they knew that it was only for show and Barack Obama would veto it. It’s hard to overstate the degree to which White House officials and Senate GOP leaders just want to pass something — really, anything — to show the base that they are keeping their promise to roll back Obamacare.”

Trump targets Murkowski - Roll Call: “President Donald Trump attacked Sen. Lisa Murkowski early Wednesday after her vote Tuesday against a motion to proceed on repealing the 2010 health care law. Trump tweeted that it was ‘too bad’ that Murkowski, ‘really let Republicans, and our country down yesterday.’ Murkowski, along with Maine Sen. Susan Collins, was one of two Republicans who voted against a motion to proceed to allowed debate on repealing the health law signed by former President

Barack Obama. Murkowski and Collins were also among nine Republicans who voted against the Better Care Reconciliation Act Tuesday night. Murkowski has been a frequent critic of Senate GOP leadership’s attempts to repeal Obamacare without a replacement.”

Alaskan unimpressed: ‘How about doing a little governing around here?’ - Courtesy of Sally Persons at the WashTimes: “Sen. Lisa Murkowski criticized her colleagues for positioning their vote on health care in terms of an electoral prospects. ‘I am in a position where I’m not looking for a re-election until 2022. And quite honestly, I don’t think it’s wise to be operating on a daily basis thinking about what a statement, or a response that causes you to be fearful of your electoral prospects,’ Ms. Murkowski, Alaska Republican, told MSNBC.”



TRUMP SEEKS TO DISCHARGE THOUSANDS OF TRANS TROOPS

Fox News: “President Trump tweeted Wednesday that the U.S. government will not allow transgender people ‘to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military.’ … The president’s tweets came only a few weeks after Defense Secretary James Mattis said he would give military chiefs another six months to conduct a review to determine if allowing transgender individuals to enlist in the armed services will affect the ‘readiness or lethality’ of the force. The deadline for that review was Dec. 1, 2017. … ‘Frankly, senator, I’ve never cared much about two consenting adults and who they go to bed with,’ Mattis testified [during his confirmation hearing in January]. The Pentagon has refused to release any data on the number of transgender troops currently serving. A RAND study found that there are between 2,500 and 7,000 transgender service members in the active-duty military, and another 1,500 to 4,000 in the reserves.”

How much do transgender troops cost taxpayers? - WaPo: “On Twitter this morning, President Trump announced a ban on transgender people serving in the military, citing ‘medical costs’ as the primary driver of the decision. …Considering the prevalence of transgender service members among the active duty military and the typical health-care costs for gender-transition-related medical treatment, the Rand study estimated that these treatments would cost the military between $2.4 million and $8.4 million annually. … By contrast, total military spending on erectile dysfunction medicines amounts to $84 million annually, according to an analysis by the Military Times… The military spends $41.6 million annually on Viagra alone, according to the Military Times analysis – roughly five times the estimated spending on transition-related medical care for transgender troops.

WASSERMAN SCHULTZ AIDE NABBED TRYING TO FLEE U.S.

Politico: “Imran Awan, a House staffer at the center of a criminal investigation potentially impacting dozens of Democratic lawmakers, has been arrested on bank fraud and is prevented from leaving the country while the charges are pending. A senior House Democratic aide confirmed Awan was still employed by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) as of Tuesday morning. But David Damron, a spokesman for Wasserman Schultz, later said that Awan was fired on Tuesday. Awan pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to one count of bank fraud during his arraignment in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. … Awan was arrested at Dulles Airport on Monday evening before boarding a flight to Lahore, Pakistan. … Awan, a longtime IT staffer who worked for more than two dozen House Democrats, has been at the center of a criminal investigation on Capitol Hill for months related to procurement theft.”

AUDIBLE: WHEN YOU’RE A JET…

“I’m a front stabber.” – White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci speaking to Fox News about how his approach differs from Washington’s penchant for backstabbing.

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“As an American, Navy veteran, and Republican have the utmost respect for Senator John McCain. Charles' commentary is spot on. A true colleague would have saved Senator McCain the arduous journey to Washington and instead had voted in his stead. I cannot think of a more powerful statement of small ‘r’ republicanism then a democratic senator rising to speak on Senator McCain's behalf. Fortunately, Senator McCain arrived without harm to delivery his eloquent petition for decorum and civility to world's greatest deliberative body.” – Dan Burch, Turlock, Calif.

[Ed. note: Hear, hear, Mr. Burch!]



“Your scoreboard has become out-of-date and irrelevant. [Tuesday’s] board shows Trump's ‘net approval’ as ‘down 18.4 points,’ which is a ‘-0.8 point change from a week ago.’ These numbers are only meaningful if you have a starting point from which to compare the new numbers. Down 18.4 from what? Sorry . . . but our 24/7 news cycle makes it impossible to remember the headlines from two days ago, much less approval ratings from six months ago. This seems like the kind of gimmicky, agenda-driven tactic I’ve come to expect from the mainstream media, not from the straight-forward, hard-hitting Chris Stirewalt that we all know and love (well . . . most of us, anyway!). How about just showing what his actual approval rating is and, if you feel context is needed, contrast it with his approval rating on Inauguration Day. Then, trust us to do the math!” – Fred MacDonald, Lake Arthur, N.M.



[Ed. note: You have convinced me, Mr. MacDonald! Our Scoreboard does need more context. But an approval number by itself doesn’t say enough, since it fails to factor in the strength of opposition. A president with a 45 percent job approval rating who only had 30 percent of the country disapproving of his performance would be in a far different position politically than one facing 55 percent disapproval. So I’m going to stick with a single metric that takes both numbers into account. But, as you saw above, that explanatory text will appear in each subsequent addition of this note (until we think of a better option). It shall henceforth be known as the MacDonald Rule. Thanks for reading and taking the time to write.]



“What is the history and purpose of the August Recess? Why when there is so much unfinished business would our law makers leave Washington for an extended period of time? I hope it’s not as simple as they believe they have earned a vacation.” – Jim Hain, Omaha, Neb.



[Ed. note: Congressional recesses are funny things, Mr. Hain. On the one hand, American’s want their lawmakers to be in touch with reality and the voices of their constituents. On the other hand, we want them to be diligent in executing their duties. I tend to generally agree with Gideon Tucker, who famously wrote, “No man’s life, liberty or property are safe when the legislature is in session,” but I also understand the frustration among those who feel like there is so much work to be done that no relief should be afforded to lawmakers. In truth, though, there isn’t much to vote on just now. September will be a hellscape in Congress as a pile of must-pass legislation comes before members. Them spending two extra weeks eating peanuts and annoying their staffs won’t do anything to make that easier. In fact, one could argue, that going home and hearing from their constituents will do far more to produce results than sitting here and breathing that swampy Potomac air.]



“Trump should appoint a team of health care knowledgeable Senators and Congressmen (perhaps 5 Republicans and 4 Democrats) and tell them to come up with a Bill that will pass and satisfy the few strong objections of the current bills, mandates, high costs, excessive coverage, uncontrolled Medicaid expenses, etc. A Simpson/Bowles approach might work. BTW, it is time to revisit the proposals of Simpson/Bowles!” – Dixon Johnston,

Greensboro, N.C.



[Ed. note: Your idea is an interesting one! But that only could work if the Congress first voted to repeal the existing law. I can imagine a scenario in which a blue-ribbon commission could do something quite interesting in advance of a deadline for repeal. The issue now, though, is that there is too little time to fashion a comprehensive solution before insurance rates are set for next year. What Congress is doing right now is, essentially, keeping an empty shell of legislation in motion that can be filled with whatever policy for propping up the individual insurance market that could pass in September. I suspect the hope of the White House and Congressional leaders is that whatever ball of chewing gum and baling wire that would end up passing could, however speciously, be called “repeal and replace” and then just forget the whole thing.]

CHECK THE SHED FOR A PICASSO

The Guardian: “The rock star Alice Cooper has found an Andy Warhol masterpiece that could be worth millions ‘rolled up in a tube’ in a storage locker, where it lay forgotten for more than 40 years. … According to Shep Gordon, the singer’s longtime manager, Cooper and Warhol became friends at the famous Max’s Kansas City venue in New York City. ‘…At the time Alice is making two albums a year and touring the rest of the time. It was a rock’n’roll time, none of us thought about anything. He ends up going into an insane asylum for his drinking and then leaves New York for LA,’ [Gordon said.] … Then, four years ago, Gordon was having dinner with a Los Angeles art dealer [who] mentioned how much a Warhol had recently fetched at auction [$11.6 million]. ‘Alice’s mother remembered it going into storage,’ he said. ‘So we went and found it rolled up in a tube.’”

He Joined The Network As A Senior National Correspondent In January', 'Based In The Atlanta Bureau.']",FOX News,"A previously unknown eighth participant in Donald Trump Jr.’s controversial campaign-season meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya has been identified as Ike Kaveladze, Fox News confirmed Tuesday.

Kaveladze’s attorney, Scott Balber, confirmed his identity.

Balber also told Fox News that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office is now seeking information on Kaveladze.

Mueller’s office declined to comment on the matter.

Kaveladze serves as vice president of commercial real estate company Crocus Group, owned by Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov. Balber also serves as counsel for the tycoon's son, Russian pop singer Emin Agalarov.

DONALD TRUMP JR.'S MEETING WITH RUSSIAN LAWYER: WHAT TO KNOW

Emin also is represented by publicist Rob Goldstone, the contact who originally sought to arrange the controversial June 9, 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya -- who was thought to have dirt on Hillary Clinton but ended up discussing sanctions. The circumstances surrounding the Trump Tower meeting have since fueled critics who claim the Trump team coordinated with Russia, though President Trump has defended his son's actions.

Kaveladze has dual-citizenship in the United States and Russia. Kaveladze attended Moscow Academy of Finance for his undergraduate degree, and received a Master in Business Administration from the University of New Haven in Connecticut.

The number of people known to have attended the meeting grew to eight last week. They included: Donald Trump Jr.; Trump son-in-law and now-senior adviser Jared Kushner; and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort; Goldstone; and Veselnitskaya.

RUSSIAN LOBBYIST, UNNAMED TRANSLATOR ATTENDED TRUMP TOWER MEETING WITH RUSSIAN LAWYER

Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin confirmed his participation in the meeting on Friday. Akhmetshin told the Associated Press that Trump Jr. asked Veselnitskaya for evidence of illicit money flowing to the Democratic National Committee, but Veselnitskaya said she did not have that information.

Akhmetshin, also a U.S. citizen, reportedly said that “they couldn’t wait for the meeting to end,” referring to Trump Jr., Manafort and Kushner.

With Kaveladze and Akhmetshin identified, many speculate the other individual served as a translator during the meeting.

Reports suggest Anatoli Samochornov, a former State Department contractor, could be the identity of that other participant. Samochornov is known to be Veselnitskaya’s interpreter, and there are reports that he was in the meeting serving as a translator."

CAN TRUMP TOLERATE BEING TREATED AS A FIGUREHEAD?

One of the things people have liked best about Donald Trump since long before he was president is that he doesn’t seem to be tied up with a bunch of deeply held beliefs.

He is transparently transactional. And while that may trouble those with more developed ideologies, it actually comforts most people. The guy may be a little off the wall, but he’s not a nut. In business and politics, he postures himself as a pragmatic dealmaker.

The assumption goes like this: You might have to worry about someone like Ted Cruz or Bernie Sanders acting recklessly or refusing to work with others because of an arcane belief structure, but not Trump. While you might have to be concerned about Trump being a hothead, you can count on him being more interested in getting a win.

Every politician changes opinions on subjects, but the sheer breadth of Trump’s stated policy positions on health insurance alone reminds us that this is a man who could with equal enthusiasm hawk frozen steaks and massive international real-estate developments.

It’s not the product, it’s the sale.

This has been a powerful dynamic in his young, tumultuous administration. Top economic adviser Gary Cohn summed it up in his remarks on why he chose to remain in the administration despite Trump’s claim that some “very fine people” had marched with the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis in the Charlottesville, Va. protest that ended with the apparent murder of a counterdemonstrator.

Cohn told the Financial Times essentially that he wanted to quit over Charlottesville, but thought it would be more important for him to stay – the implicit understanding being that only by remaining inside could he “grapple with” the worst instincts of the president and some other advisers.

Cohn is part of what the White House spelunkers at Axios dubbed “the committee to save America” – senior advisers, cabinet officials and senior lawmakers acting in loose concert to protect the president from himself and thereby keep the country from harm.

The informal claque is said to include White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis as well as Cohn, a Democrat and former Goldman Sachs executive, and Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell, one of very few Bush administration returnees in the upper ranks of Team Trump.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson applied for at least associate membership this week when he told Fox News colleague Chris Wallace in no uncertain terms that Trump was not a spokesman for the values of the American people. “The president speaks for himself,” the former oil mogul said.

It would sound like an even more astonishingly arrogant point of view for subordinates to take if it weren’t for the fact that Trump actually seems to like playing the bad schoolboy kicking his schoolmasters in the shins.

At the same raucous rally last week where Trump hinted that he might pardon fellow birther and immigration hardliner, former Phoenix-area Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the president openly taunted his advisers as Trump attacked the state’s two sitting Republican senators.

“You know, they all said, ‘Mr. President, your speech [announcing a re-escalation of troop levels in Afghanistan] was so good... Please. Please, Mr. President. Don’t mention any names.’” Trump mocked. “So, I won’t. I won’t. No, I won’t. I won’t mention any names. That’s presidential, isn’t it? Very presidential.”

As you already know, Trump went on to make sure everyone know exactly who he was talking about, and in very disparaging terms. The message to his advisers: I say what I want. But for the members of the administration, these little embarrassments are a small price to pay for the chance to, in their minds, save America.

The idea commonly held in Washington is that we are living under something like a regency, in which the real power is behind the throne and the dauphin is just a ceremonial ruler. Don’t listen to what Trump says, believers in the regency would tell you, just watch what the administration does.

And given the conventionality of most of Trump’s choices, especially the troop surge in Afghanistan, re-certification of the Iran nuclear deal and go-slow approach on the North American Free Trade Agreement, it’s hard to discount the argument that the establishmentarians around Trump are steering the ship of state.

This has made unlikely heroes of these figures to many, even on the left. When Trump does something that not even his staunchest allies can defend, like pardoning Arpaio or talking about sending troops to Venezuela or musing about letting insurance subsidies lapse for millions of families in order to drive Democrats to the negotiating table, official Washington thinks “Thank God for Mattis,” or whichever adviser was tasked with blocking that particular shot on goal.

And maybe it will work. Maybe Cohn can get the tax plan across the finish line next month. Maybe Mattis and Tillerson can prevent nuclear war in Asia. Maybe Kelly can knock enough heads together to get a patch for ObamaCare before time runs out. And Maybe Trump will just tweet and riff at rallies and say wild things while the committee works its will.

Or maybe Trump, who is a more avid news consumer than perhaps any modern president, will get sick of reading and hearing again and again how he really isn’t the president. Trump may love the fantastic press Kelly & Co. have been getting for calming the neurotic dysfunction of the West Wing, but there’s no way he likes the idea of him getting none of the credit.

Trumps’ recent acting out – the snarling repudiation of his scripted statement on Charlottesville, the Arpaio pardon, the attacks on members of Congress ahead of crucial negotiations, etc. – may just be part of an ongoing cycle of rebellion and acquiescence that has dominated Trump’s public life.

But one the core assumptions of those who believe we are living under the Trump regency – and perhaps some of his advisers, as well – is that original notion that Trump really doesn’t have ideas of his own and is content to be a pitchman and a figurehead.

It may be that as his administration comes to function better, Trump will find new ways to assert himself and continue to reveal his own worldview. Trump learned as a candidate. Why wouldn’t he as president?

Those who assume we are entering into a calmer, more stable version of Trumpism may be in for a shock.

THE RULEBOOK: FIRST THINGS

“The want of a guaranty, though it might in its consequences endanger the Union, does not so immediately attack its existence as the want of a constitutional sanction to its laws.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 21

TIME OUT: BIG SMALL SCREEN

New Yorker: “In 2002, in an article called ‘The Televisionary,’ Malcolm Gladwell told the story of the invention of television. The visionary in question was a man named Philo T. Farnsworth. … For decades, he was widely known as the inventor of television. The truth was that television was an incredibly complex technology; hundreds, even thousands, of engineers had contributed to perfecting it. … By the time TV became a commercial reality, in the late thirties, its many inventors had learned to accept that no one person could claim to have created it—that, as Gladwell put it, ‘the machine was larger than they were.’ That turned out to be true for the rest of us, too. For nearly a century, television, like the weather, has shaped our behaviors, our moods, and our desires in ways we don’t always comprehend. The New Yorker, which was founded in 1925, was there from the beginning, covering television from its invention onward.”

TRUMP PROMISES FAST FEDERAL FUNDS FOR HARVEY

Wash Times: “As flooding intensified Monday in Texas and Louisiana, taxpayers are likely to be asked to pony up for a cleanup effort lasting years and costing tens of billions of dollars in federal assistance. President Trump said the cleanup will be expensive but he expects no difficulties from Congress. Democrats and Republicans were eager to promise full cooperation. ... Ahead of a Tuesday trip to get a firsthand look at the situation, Mr. Trump told a Texas reporter at a press conference Monday that the federal government will take care of the state. ‘You’re going to get your funding,’ Mr. Trump said. ‘We think you’re going to have what you need, and it’s going to go fast.’ It was too early for coherent estimates of cleanup costs for Harvey, but Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Superstorm Sandy in 2012 resulted in federal aid packages of roughly $100 billion and $50 billion, respectively.”

He shall return? - AP: “Trump, who is suffering through a long stretch of low approval ratings, has been particularly eager to seize the moment. He will visit Texas Tuesday — and may return to the region again on Saturday. The White House announced the first visit even before Harvey made landfall.”

TRUMP TO KICK OFF TAX REFORM PUSH WEDNESDAY

NYT: “Gary D. Cohn and Steven Mnuchin have spent months behind closed doors with Republican congressional leaders sketching the contours of an elaborate and politically difficult tax overhaul that is President Trump’s top priority. Mr. Trump hopes to jump-start the process on Wednesday, traveling to Springfield, Mo., for a speech calling for large tax reductions and a long-anticipated revamping of the code. But he has largely left it to Mr. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, and Mr. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, both new to government, to devise and execute a winning legislative strategy. … Already, their ambitions have drifted from the president’s original mark: A 15 percent corporate tax rate proposed in April is now likely to move to the 20 to 25 percent range… a proposed 35 percent ceiling on the highest personal income tax rate could be shelved altogether, leaving the current 39.6 percent cap intact.”

DEMOCRATS GET STARTED DOWN THE 2020 ROAD

Politico: “Just like that, the 2020 retail campaigning for president began right here in a strip-mall campaign headquarters Monday, when Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti showed up for what he called ‘the most important race in the country.’ … On Tuesday, Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), the only one to have already officially announced, will be here for a two-day trip, trying to get attention for his long-shot bid. On Labor Day, both Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Jason Kander, the Democrat who narrowly lost his U.S. Senate bid in Missouri last year, will be back. … And on Thursday, Sanders — who was in Indiana and Michigan last week — will be in Iowa, along with Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon will be there in October. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who made his own teasing stop here in Manchester at the end of April, is headed to South Carolina in September.”

Bannon backs Moore in Alabama Senate race - Politico: “Just-departed White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is breaking from President Donald Trump in the closely watched Alabama Senate special election. During a closed-door meeting with powerful conservatives in Washington last week, Bannon declared that he's supporting former state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore over Trump-endorsed incumbent Sen. Luther Strange, according to two people who were present. Bannon, who just over a week ago left the White House to rejoin the conservative website Breitbart News, said he is looking to activate the conservative base to Moore’s cause.”

Rep. Lou Barletta to announce Senate bid Tuesday - The Hill: “Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.) will announce his entrance into the Pennsylvania Senate GOP primary early Tuesday morning, Times Leader reported Monday evening. The announcement will be through a video statement, the report said. Barletta, who was an early backer of President Trump, will enter a race that so far includes two Pennsylvania Republican state representatives. The winner of the primary will ultimately face off against incumbent Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.).”

MUELLER INVESTIGATING TRUMP'S ROLE IN DON JR. MEETING

The Hill: “Special counsel Robert Mueller’s team is allegedly investigating President Trump’s part in responding to reports about the meeting his advisers had with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential race. NBC News reported Monday that investigators are trying to determine what Trump knew about the meeting and if he tried to hide its purpose. Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort were all in attendance at the Trump Tower meeting. ‘Even if Trump is not charged with a crime as a result of the statement, it could be useful to Mueller's team to show Trump's conduct to a jury that may be considering other charges’ a source told NBC. … Mueller, who was appointed by the Justice Department to oversee the federal government's response into Moscow's meddling in the presidential election, is probing if Trump helped construct a ‘knowingly false statement,’ according to NBC.”

Meanwhile, Rep. DeSantis looks to kill probe - Politico: “Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) is pushing an amendment to severely curtail special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. DeSantis has put forward a provision that would halt funding for Mueller’s probe six months after the amendment’s passage. It also would prohibit Mueller from investigating matters that occurred before June 2015, when Trump launched his presidential campaign. The amendment is one of hundreds filed to a government spending package the House is expected to consider when it returns next week from the August recess. The provision is not guaranteed a vote on the House floor; the House Rules Committee has wide leeway to discard amendments it considers out of order.”



BATTLE OF BERKELEY WILL RAGE ON

Fox News: “More than a dozen people were arrested in Berkeley, California, after members of the Antifa movement allegedly attacked peaceful protesters over the weekend -- and one of those protesters opened up to Fox News on Monday about the violent threats she heard. ‘They came with black masks, they carried weapons, they were pounding people down with their fists and their feet,’ Berkeley College Republican Ashton Whitty said on ‘The Story with Martha MacCallum.’ … ‘I find out then that Antifa actually had several people posted around Berkeley tracking us and telling people our location by social media.’ More than 100 hooded protesters, with shields sporting the words ‘no hate’ and waving a flag identifying themselves as anarchists, broke through security lines to reach the conservative protesters. ‘I was willing to discuss anything,’ Whitty said. “I held up a poster that said ‘let’s just have a conversation.’ … And, everything was great until Antifa showed up.’”

Eli Lake: Play amongst yourselves - Bloomberg: “As America feels like it's coming apart at the seams, I have a modest proposal. The hard-right and hard-left activists who so enjoy protesting one another should meet every few weekends in a large national park and have at it. The rest of us could begin to treat this wave of street agitation as the sideshow it is. After all, this is not a fight for the soul of America. Neither the Tiki-torch Nazis nor the masked anarchists represent a viable American future. They are simply engaging in nostalgia, a scarier version of Civil War battle re-enactments. Lumping them together does not equate two unequal sides. The cause of anti-fascism is noble, whereas the racists marching in Charlottesville are telling journalists like me I should be sent to the ovens. I'm not talking about the folks on the left who are nonviolent and unmasked, showing up to protest the fascists.”

WSJ Ed. Board: Left should denounce violence - WSJ Editorial Board: “This weekend two right-wing groups sought to hold peaceful rallies. Their leaders—Patriot Prayer’s Joey Gibson, a Japanese-American, and Amber Cummings, a transgender Trump supporter—explicitly denounced racism. Amid fears of violence, both cancelled their events. Antifa showed up anyway, outnumbering and terrorizing any right-wingers or Trump supporters who dared show their faces. Antifa views itself as fundamentally reactionary, as a necessary opposition to corrosive ideologies. But because your foe is a really bad guy doesn’t mean you’re inherently a good one. Movements are defined not merely by what they oppose but by what they do. Antifa’s censorious criminality resembles the very political behavior it claims to fight. The mainstream left ought to denounce it as much as the right should reject white supremacists.”

“Only morons pay the estate tax.” – White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, quoted by the New York Times, at a meeting with Senate Democrats.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Just watched you and the ladies [on “Outnumbered”] besmirch the pardon of Joe Arpaio, as a garbage pardon. I seriously don't recall your reaction to the Chelsea Manning pardon. Let's see, as a NH State Representative when President Obama came into office, the first thing is Justice Department did was let us all know in state government that his administration was going to look the other way and not enforce many ""non-violent"" crimes. Funny, the office of the Presidency is to uphold the laws on the books. As Secretary Sessions has said repeatedly, if you don't like the laws, change them, until then, they will be enforced. It is my understanding that the Sherriff was not given his 6th amendment right to a trial by jury and that the Judge refused to hear witnesses. The verdict was not given to the defendant directly and he only learned of it by the news outlets. So what was garbage, the trial or the pardon? I guess you think it's a good thing to put an 85 year old in jail for protecting citizens and enforcing laws on the books. Perhaps it's time you read some of Greg Jarrett's columns on how those individuals in authority who don't follow the immigration laws on the books are eligible for jail terms themselves.” – Doreen Howard, Newmarket, N.H.



[Ed. note: You make an excellent case for the president’s choice to pardon Arpaio, at least from a political point of view. Trump’s political strategy is all about maintaining maximum intensity among his most ardent followers. And I can certainly feel your intensity on this one! At the time that Obama commuted the remaining years of Manning’s pardon I said, in essence, was that it was a lot of cynical pandering to his own base. Especially given the role WikiLeaks would play in disrupting the 2016 election on behalf of the Kremlin, pardoning Manning seemed all the more indefensible from a policy standpoint. It was pure identity politics. And so is this one. Trump said he did it to coincide with high ratings for hurricane coverage. A court ordered Arpaio and his department to stop racially profiling Hispanic people to try to enforce federal civil immigration laws not subject to his jurisdiction. Whether you think that right or wrong, it was a lawful court order which Arpaio ignored unto the point of contempt. Rather than appealing and working through the system, he got a reprieve from a powerful political benefactor, an ally he had made back when they were both in the trenches of trying to prove Obama was a secret Kenyan. Arpaio hadn’t been sentenced and was in no discernable immediate danger of being jailed and Trump didn’t even follow internal protocols of his own administration’s to prevent abuses. This pardon was an symbolic swat at the federal judiciary and a new low for a process that has become quite rotten over the years. Jonathan Turley referred to the Arpaio pardon as the “dregs left at the bottom of a now depleted and despoiled process.” But it will surely achieve its aim of keeping the president’s mad-as-hell base, some of whom have been with him since the birther business, fired up.]

In his monologue on ""The Five"" tonight, Greg Gutfeld reacted to an ""explosive"" report that revealed the Obama administration allowed Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya to enter the U.S.

Veselnitskaya is the attorney thought to have damaging information on Hillary Clinton who met with Donald Trump Jr. in June 2016. Trump Jr. maintains that she had no information on Clinton and nothing came from the brief meeting.

According to a report in The Hill, Attorney General Loretta Lynch signed off on granting the attorney special ""parole"" to be in the U.S.

Gutfeld said this revelation was largely overlooked by the mainstream media because it doesn't fit their narrative.

""A mysterious Russian is granted special entry, then pulls a bait-and-switch on a naive private citizen, a citizen who happens to be a Trump,"" Gutfeld said. ""So, who's colluding now?""

He said what Veselnitskaya did to Trump Jr. is exactly what the media has done to the public every day since the election.

""They bait, then switch. They promise something juicy, but when you hear them out, it's emptier than a protester's resume,"" Gutfeld said. ""And when their hysteria is met with public disgust, what does the media do? Rather than admit to their compulsive overselling, they blame those who question them.""

""Suddenly it's your fault for being skeptical. It's your fault when their mania trumps fact. It's your fault for their addiction to relitigating the past,"" Gutfeld continued. ""They say when you're a hammer, everything becomes a nail. When you're a bitter hack, everything becomes collusion. Except, actual collusion.""

Follow Her On Twitter At']",FOX News,"The Obama administration granted the Russian attorney who met with Donald Trump Jr. last June a special type of “parole” to be in the United States after she initially was denied a visa, Fox News has confirmed – though it remains unclear whether she had permission to be in the country when she attended the Trump Tower session.

That meeting has, in the last week, caused massive headaches for the Trump White House, with the revelation that an intermediary told the president's son the attorney had dirt on Hillary Clinton, supposedly as part of the Russian government's bid to help his dad.

But as lawmakers from both parties are scrutinizing the Trump family over the contacts, one powerful senator is pressing to find out how attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya was in the country at all.

Well before the June 9, 2016, meeting, she was denied a visa to enter the U.S. in 2015, according to court filings first reported by the Daily Beast. She was granted a “parole” to be in the country from October 2015 through early January 2016. However, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York told Fox News on Thursday that their office did not extend that status.

“She was not granted a second parole by our office,” office spokesman James Margolin told Fox News in an email. “Her case-related immigration parole ended early in 2016, and it was not renewed by us.”

Veselnitskaya’s Facebook posts and documented meetings show that she remained in the United States well after her initial parole expired in early January 2016. This includes photos of New York City’s Columbus Circle well into February, raising questions as to how she was allowed to be in the country at that time -- and for her meeting with Trump Jr. as well as a trip to Washington, D.C. days after. Campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner also attended that meeting.

“She shouldn’t have been in the country,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told “Fox & Friends” on Wednesday. “I think the lady Russian lawyer that was there in that meeting, I’ve written to [The State Department and Department of Homeland Security] to find out what she was doing in the country when presumably either her visa or parole expired.”

A spokesman for the Senate Judiciary Committee told Fox News that they had yet to receive a response.

The State Department did not confirm or deny that Veselnitskaya even applied for a visa, but told Fox News that the department is prohibited by the Immigration and Nationality Act from discussing individual visa cases. The State Department did, however, tell Fox News that all visa applications are adjudicated on a case-by-case basis.

The Hill reported on Wednesday that it was the Obama Department of Justice that granted Veselnitskaya her temporary parole allowing her into the country to help a client on a court case in the New York federal court. The U.S. attorney’s office told Fox News that Veselnitskaya was indeed granted initial parole by their office, but did not know who, specifically, issued the “piece of paper.”

The Hill reported the parole was approved by then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

In court documents, the attorney acknowledged she had ""applied for a visa to enter the United States, but was denied.""

She continued, “However, the United States did issue a parole letter for me to enter the United States in order to help defend this lawsuit. Nevertheless, I have been harassed by the Government despite being paroled into the United States.”

In the same documents, she confirmed that her request to extend her parole, which expired Jan. 7 2016, was denied a few days before that deadline.

Unclear is how she was in the U.S. several months later and whether other agencies were also involved in her parole decision from the outset.

GRASSLEY PROBING HOW RUSSIAN LAWYER GOT INTO US AFTER VISA DENIAL

A range of Department of Homeland Security agencies would typically deal with parole requests. However, Acting Chief of Media Relations for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Gillian Christensen told Fox News that USCIS was not involved in this case.

Broadly speaking, Christensen told Fox News that parole is granted “sparingly” and in “extraordinary circumstances,” including urgent humanitarian reasons, such as a medical or family emergency. The official also told Fox News that parole may be requested for a person who “believes his or her presence in the United States will be a significant public benefit,” and cited participation in a civil court case as an example.

Veselnitskaya was working as an attorney for a Cyprus-based real estate holdings company called Prevezon, run by Denis Katsyv, son of Pyotr Katsyv, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest advisers, and was given “unlimited resources” by the Kremlin-connected group to run a campaign to get the Magnitsky Act repealed, Fox News reported Wednesday. The Magnitsky Act enacts sanctions on certain Russian officials as a punishment for human rights violations.

“Parole allows an individual to enter the United States and remain for a temporary period corresponding to the reason parole was approved,” Christensen told Fox News. “Parole is generally not authorized for more than one year.”"

Krauthammer: Donald Jr. Story 'First Empirical Evidence' of Collusion

Meghan McCain said on ""Outnumbered"" today that the White House must come clean about all contacts with Russians.

Charles Krauthammer said this week that President Trump's son Donald Jr. meeting last spring with a Russian lawyer in an attempt to obtain dirt on the Clintons is a ""damning"" revelation.

Writing in the Washington Post, Krauthammer said:

""It was literally just a wasted 20 minutes, which was a shame,"" Donald Jr. told Sean Hannity. A shame? On the contrary, a stroke of luck. Had the lawyer real stuff to deliver, Donald Jr. and the others would be in far deeper legal trouble. It turned out to be incompetent collusion, amateur collusion, comically failed collusion. That does not erase the fact that three top Trump campaign officials were ready to play. It may turn out that they did later collaborate more fruitfully. We don’t know. But even if nothing else is found, the evidence is damning.

Earlier today, we learned that a Russian-American lobbyist named Rinat Akhmetshin was also in the meeting. Some reports allege Akhmetshin was a former Soviet counterintelligence officer, though he denies that.

Top House Democrat Adam Schiff (CA) called the development ""deeply disturbing,"" accusing the White House of lying about the meeting details as the story continues to change.

McCain emphasized that the White House has said there were no contacts with Russia and Trump associates, yet reports of meetings keep surfacing month after month.

""If there is a God in heaven right now, I beg the White House to come out with every shot of vodka you've taken with any Russian,"" she argued.

Mark Steyn pointed out that Akhmetshin had become a U.S. citizen by the time the meeting took place, but is now being called by Democrats a ""top intelligence operative"" for the Kremlin.

""Obviously it would be appropriate for anybody to get into anything that went on at that meeting, and he was at that meeting,"" committee chairman Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, told local reporters Wednesday.

Manafort sat in on Trump Jr.'s meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya in Manhattan's Trump Tower, as did Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner.

Manafort disclosed the meeting in a package of information he provided to the Senate and House intelligence committees, who have been investigating allegations of potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, as is Robert Mueller, the former FBI director appointed by the Justice Department as the special counsel.



Grassley said he and the committee's ranking member, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., have agreed to try to bring Manafort before the panel for questioning about the government's enforcement of a law requiring registration of foreign lobbyists. Feinstein's office confirmed that they plan to question him.

A person close to Manafort told the Associated Press that he hasn't yet received a letter from the committee about a possible interview.

Separately, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking member on the House intelligence committee, said his panel wants to look at the use of Russian social media ""trolls"" and whether they were connected to the Trump election campaign. That concern is ""certainly something we want to explore,"" along with the Trump campaign's data analytics, Schiff said. Kushner oversaw digital strategy for the campaign.



""One of the biggest crimes we're looking at is the hacking of data, so understanding how it was used certainly needs to be part of the investigation,"" said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., another member of the committee. ""We want to understand what data was hacked, where it was stored and if it was weaponized at all, whether it was by Russia or the campaign.""



The lawmakers spoke one day after Trump Jr. disclosed on Twitter a series of emails that revealed his eagerness to hear negative material on Clinton from a Russian lawyer, who turned out to be Veselnitskaya



The exchange showed Trump Jr. conversing with a music publicist named Rob Goldstone, who wanted him to meet with a ""Russian government attorney"" who supposedly had dirt on Clinton as ""part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump."" He was told the Russian government had information that could ""incriminate"" Clinton and her dealings with Russia.



""If it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer,"" Trump Jr. said in one email response.

The president's eldest son defended his actions in an interview with Fox News' ""Hannity"" Tuesday night, blaming the decision to take the meeting on the ""million miles per hour"" pace of a presidential campaign and his suspicion that Veselnitskaya might have information about ""underreported"" scandals involving Clinton.

Trump Jr. said the meeting ""really went nowhere"" and that he never told his father about it because there was ""nothing to tell.""



""In retrospect I probably would have done things a little differently,"" Trump Jr. said.

In an interview before departing Wednesday evening for France, Trump told Reuters that he didn't know about the meeting ""until a couple of days ago when I heard about this."" He also said that he didn't fault his son for attending. ""I think many people would have held that meeting,"" he said.

Investigations into alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign have shadowed the White House for months.



Still, Trump remains defiant. ""There was zero coordination"" between his campaign and Russia,"" he told Reuters, adding: ""It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.""

“These emails show there is no longer a question of whether this campaign sought to collude with a hostile foreign power to subvert America’s democracy,” Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said in a statement. “The question is how far the coordination goes.”

On Tuesday, the president’s son released his emails in the lead-up to a June 9, 2016 meeting with a Russian attorney after an acquaintance claimed the contact had damaging information on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The emails were with Rob Goldstone, who arranged the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner also attended the meeting.

DONALD TRUMP JR. RELEASES EMAIL CHAIN ON RUSSIA MEETING

The emails, released by Trump Jr. ahead of a New York Times story on the communications, show the president’s son was told Russia’s government preferred Trump over Clinton. ""This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump,” Goldstone wrote in one email released Tuesday.

Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen told reporters at the Capitol the email exchange shows “clear collaboration between the Russian government and Russian government agents and the Trump campaign.” He said “the email is very clear that the Russian government is weighing in to help elect Donald Trump.”

“There’s no escaping it: the Trump campaign’s inner circle met with an agent of a hostile foreign power to influence the outcome of an American election,” House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday.

Brian Fallon, who served as press secretary to Clinton during the presidential race, tweeted Tuesday his appreciation of a special counsel in the Russia investigation. “Thank God someone as competent and patriotic as Bob Mueller is in charge of investigating this awful mess,” he said.

Trump Jr., who is expected to discuss the situation Tuesday night at 10 p.m. ET with Fox News' Sean Hannity, said in a statement Tuesday he released the emails in the interest of transparency.

He has downplayed the significance of the meeting all along and said in his latest statement that he presumed the information the contact had was ""Political Opposition Research.""

""I first wanted to just have a phone call but when they didn’t work out, they said the woman would be in New York and asked if I would meet. I decided to take the meeting,"" he explained.

He also said the woman ""was not a government official"" and ""had no information to provide.""

He added, ""To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue.""

Some Republicans are also expressing concern. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham called the emails “disturbing” and urged the president's son to testify.

“Anytime you’re in a campaign and you get an offer from a foreign government to help your campaign, the answer is no,” he told reporters. “So I don’t know what Mr. Trump Jr.’s version of the facts are. Definitely he has to testify. That email is disturbing.”

A spokesman for Vice President Mike Pence said he was unaware of the meeting.

“He is also not focused on stories about the campaign – especially those pertaining to the time before he joined the campaign,” said Marc Lotter, Vice President Pence’s press secretary.

The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said on ""Fox & Friends"" that he has written to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and DHS Secretary John Kelly in an effort to find out what happened.

""It was in the previous administration [and] if there had been enforcement of the immigration laws, she wouldn't have been in the country,"" said Grassley.

The senator said if Natalia Veselnitskaya was representing a foreign government she should have been registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act and that the law ""was not enforced the way it should be enforced"" under the Obama administration.

Grassley said there will be a hearing within days on the lax enforcement.

Brian Kilmeade noted that Veselnitskaya was connected to Fusion GPS, a DNC opposition research firm behind the Trump-Russia dossier.

Trump Jr. responded last night on ""Hannity"" after releasing emails with a publicist, Rob Goldstone, who set up the June 2016 meeting.

In the email exchange, Trump Jr. expressed interest in obtaining dirt on Hillary Clinton from Veselnitskaya, though he says none was ever produced.

Democrats, meanwhile, have characterized the revelations as a smoking gun in the investigation into collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign against Clinton.

Sean Hannity spoke exclusively with Donald Trump Jr. about his controversial meeting with a Russian lawyer.

As FoxNews.com reported:

Donald Trump Jr. acknowledged in an exclusive interview with Fox News' ""Hannity"" Tuesday night that he ""probably would have done things a little differently"" when he met with a Russian attorney during his father’s presidential campaign in June 2016.

However, the president’s eldest son also described the meeting as ""a nothing,"" telling Fox News’ Sean Hannity, ""I wouldn’t have even remembered it until you started scouring through this stuff. It was literally just a wasted 20 minutes, which was a shame.""

The interview constituted the first public statement by Donald Trump Jr. since he posted what he called ""the entire email chain"" of his conversations with music publicist Rob Goldstone setting up the June 2016 meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya on Twitter.

In one of the messages, Goldstone told Trump Jr. that Russian officials were offering ""some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary [Clinton]"" as part of ""Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.""

Trump Jr.’s response email read, in part, ""if it’s what you say I love it.""

""I had been reading about scandals that people were probably underreporting for a long time, so maybe it was something that had to do with one of those things,"" Trump Jr. told Hannity when asked about his reaction to Goldstone’s email. ""I didn’t know if there was any credibility, I didn’t know if there was anything behind it, I can’t vouch for the information. Someone sent me an email. I can’t help what someone sends me. I read it, I responded accordingly."""

Donald Trump Jr. agreed to meet with Natalia Veselnitskaya in the expectation of receiving incriminating information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as part of a Russian government effort to help his father's White House campaign, according to emails Trump Jr. has publicly released. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort also attended the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower.

The meeting raised new questions about the Trump campaign's possible ties to Moscow, which are being scrutinized by federal and congressional investigators. These questions have only intensified as the identities of other Russia-connected participants have become known.

""I am ready to clarify the situation behind the mass hysteria, but only through lawyers or testifying in the Senate,"" Veselnitskaya said in an interview with Kremlin-funded RT television broadcast Wednesday.

""If the Senate wishes to hear the real story, I will be happy to speak up and share everything I wanted to tell Mr. Trump,"" she added. That appeared to be a reference to Veselnitskaya's previous statement that the meeting with Trump Jr. focused on U.S.-Russian adoption policies and a U.S. sanctions law.

She has denied working for the Russian government.

Veselnitskaya has not responded to repeated attempts by The Associated Press to reach her for comment.

Democratic lawmakers involved in the investigations have expressed skepticism about that account."

The filings from 2011 and 2012 show that Natalia Veselnitskaya represented Military Unit 55002, which is run by the FSB, Russia's main intelligence agency, in a court case. In the case involving property rights, the state-run Federal Property Agency sought to regain ownership of a building occupied by the military unit from two private companies. The court ruled in the FPA's favor.

Veselnitskaya did not reply to messages seeking comment, but issued a Facebook post late Friday saying she had represented many sorts of clients, including U.S. citizens and people who were defending themselves against the government.

President Donald Trump's eldest son, his son-in-law and then-campaign manager met with Veselnitskaya in June 2016 after being told that she could provide potentially incriminating information about Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. The meeting has been billed by many as part of a Russian government effort to help the Republican's White House campaign.

Veselnitskaya denied having any ties to the Russian government, although the man who arranged the meeting said she got the information from Russia's prosecutor general.

She said in an interview with Kremlin-funded RT television channel earlier last week that she's ready to testify before the U.S. Senate.

The court filings described how the building which used to be property of the Soviet Ministry of Electronic Industries was privatized following the fall of the Soviet Union and sold off to two private companies. The claimant argued that the building was privatized and then sold illegally and that the military unit that was running it ""essentially owns the disputed property and bears the maintenance costs."" The military unit supported the Property Agency's claim.

The filing shows that the military unit had been using the building since 2007 after the two companies lost their first case in court in 2006. They appealed the ruling until 2012.

The five-story building in the north of Moscow is currently occupied by Electronintorg, a state-owned electronics company which services the Russian military.

Electronintorg's website says the company focuses on ""meeting the requirements of Russian enterprises"" by providing engineering services and importing electronic equipment from Western companies.

Government records show that Electronintorg has secured 3.4 million rubles ($57,000) in government contracts since 2015, mainly on orders of industrial chemicals and supplies like sodium silicate.

Respected Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta in 2005 wrote about an elaborate smuggling scheme that involved Military Unit 55002. It said nearly a million pair of shoes and 68,000 men's boxers from China had been imported illegally by the military unit which serves the FSB's procurement department."

196,##########,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/UvsUh4-fhyQ/don-jr-emails-playing-defense-after-purported-offer-from-russian-government.html,The Don Jr. emails: Playing defense after purported offer from Russian 'government',"['Howard Kurtz', 'Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst', 'The Host Of']",FOX News,"Donald Trump Jr. said he was being “fully transparent” yesterday by releasing the emails that led to his meeting with a Russian lawyer that has caused a media uproar.

It was not a pretty picture, and it confirmed the latest New York Times story on the controversy.

The move temporarily put Don Jr. back in control of the narrative rather than playing catchup after each newspaper story. The president applauded his “transparency” in a terse statement. But that transparency wasn’t entirely voluntary: the Times says he posted the emails after being told that the paper was about to publish them.

The 2016 meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya, which apparently led nowhere, may indeed turn out to be a blip. But Trump supporters who are denouncing it as fake news are missing the point. Most of what we now know about the matter—now including the emails--comes from the president’s son.

And while there’s plenty of room to debate whether this is a “nothing-burger,” as Reince Preibus put it, some on the right would be screaming if Chelsea Clinton had had taken such a meeting with a Russian lawyer supposedly offering dirt on Trump. Politics is built on selective outrage.

I get the Russia fatigue after months of coverage with little payoff, but Don Jr., who has since hired a criminal lawyer, is obviously taking it seriously. That’s why he appeared with Sean Hannity last night.

That email was from Rob Goldstone, a British PR guy and ex-tabloid reporter who does business with Russia and helped broker the meeting (adding to the colorful characters in this saga).

Goldstone said “the Crown prosecutor of Russia” had met with a Russian real estate magnate who was the father of one of his clients, pop star Emil Agalarov. The email said the prosecutor “offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

Goldstone added: “This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”

That’s critical because Trump Jr. was explicitly told that the Putin government was behind this.

His quick reply is making headlines everywhere: “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.”

Goldstone later said the meeting would be with a “Russian government attorney,” which Veselnitskaya is not, but she is close to Russia’s prosecutor general, according to the Times.

Veselnitskaya told NBC News she doesn’t know why Trump Jr. believed she was bringing oppo research on Hillary: “It’s quite possible that maybe they were looking for such information. They wanted it so badly.”

Before posting the emails, Don Jr. tweeted this, in a tone reminiscent of his father: “Media & Dems are extremely invested in the Russia story. If this nonsense meeting is all they have after a yr, I understand the desperation!”

So what are we to make of this—and the partisan reaction on both sides?

National Review’s Jonah Goldberg finds “the whole feeding frenzy [over Russia] unappealing. The Democrats are clearly in full partisan mode, framing every inconvenient, benign, or even potentially exculpatory detail as a smoking gun.”

At the same time, he says, “what I just don’t understand is how conservatives can mock, scoff at, and ridicule the idea there might be some legs to this story when Donald Trump does everything he can to make it look like there might be a there there.”

The Weekly Standard ties the controversy to the Senate’s 98-2 vote turning U.S. sanctions against Moscow into law:

“Whether the media has unfairly targeted the president and his advisers over their dealings with Russian officials is now beside the point. By a series of unforced errors—omissions of financial dealings with Russian companies, unaccountably faulty memories on meetings with Kremlin-connected operatives—the Trump team has lost all credibility on the question of Russia.”

My own take is that two things are not mutually exclusive. The coverage of the Russian “collusion” question has generally been overheated, and this particular meeting, touted as providing information from the Russian government, is important. Just how important depends on whether prosecutors and the press find that it fits into a larger pattern."

OH REALLY, BUBBA?

If it had been somebody else, we would call it a gaffe, but since it was Bill Clinton, we know better.

The former president, speaking at an event with his successor, George W. Bush, mused on the question of what makes a winning campaign, and offered a stinging rebuke of candidates that happened to sound exactly like his wife.



“Yeah, you have to win the election, but why in the heck are you running?” Clinton asked rhetorically. He said it wasn’t enough to simply disparage the other candidate, ahem, but one had to have a real agenda that voters could understand.



“If you want to be president, you have to realize it’s about the people, not about you,” said the husband of the woman who ran on “I’m with her.”



The 42nd president has a special gift for accidentally stating brutally honest truths about his wife’s campaigns, as well as the politics and policies of Barack Obama.



Put in a forum like this, something usually slips out. If they gave medals for effective deployment of passive aggression, Clinton would be the most decorated American in public life today.



It is a little quaint, though, to be lectured on purposeful, policy-oriented campaigning from a guy who made ideological fecklessness into a prized virtue. Clintonian pragmatism may have tended to moderate the liberal bent of Democrats since the Vietnam era, but it was just about going where the voters were.



Suffice it to say that he would not have won the Democratic nomination running on cutting welfare, keeping gay soldiers in the closet and rolling back Wall Street regulations.



A less lofty version of what Clinton said this week might be better said as “tell people what they want to hear.”



It is especially ironic that a guy who helped break the back of the Democratic Party in order to save himself would intone against self-centered politicians. He would know better than to have a campaign as grossly self-centered as his wife’s, but the end goal of Clintonism was only ever Clinton himself.



When we cast our eyes back over the past 30 years in politics, both sides can agree that the impeachment of Clinton was a shattering moment.

Democrats will tell you that it was when toxic Republican partisanship overtook the GOP. Whatever truth there is in that, it is also true that it was during that impeachment, Democrats just as fully embrace the concept of party over everything. And they did it all to save Bill Clinton.



With his various lies and false denials, and those of his team, Clinton made fools out of many in his party. But he drained them of their dignity so slowly that many did not notice, and some still haven’t yet.



History now recalls that sex-crazed, hypocritical, hyper-partisan, Gingrichian Republicans and their Torquemada, Ken Starr, tried to oust a sitting president for receiving the fellative ministrations of a woman who was not his wife. To say that this was well-executed spin by the president and his team understates the genius of the dishonesty.



There’s no reason to rehash all the details, but if you would have told the Democratic members of the Senate at the outset that the president had engaged in a variety of innovative sexual acts with a 21-year-old intern, has engaged in these assignations in the Oval Office, lied about it and sought to cover it up, they would have demanded he resign at once.



While it is true that the first rule of scandal is to make a full disclosure once caught, that is only in a compartmental sense. You don’t want to do what the current administration has done and be contradicted repeatedly on one part of the scandal, but there is such a thing as coming clean too quickly.



By dragging out the horrible process of his admission, defense, counterattack and public rehabilitation, Clinton wore down Democrats’ sense of outrage. By the end, the facts didn’t matter. The only thing that mattered was that Clinton stay in power because he was better than those other, awful bastards.



Listening to Republicans these days, you can feel the same sluiceway opening up. The speed with which some – including the current president – have gone from adamant denials of misconduct, to saying that the other guys are hypocrites, to saying that it’s really the smart thing to do has been stunning. It’s been the Clinton strategy, but set on fast-forward.

Perhaps fittingly, the reason that so many of the defenders of the current president will stand by their man in the face of any trouble is the depths of hatred they have against Clinton and his wife for their successful execution of the same gambit 20 years ago. In the eyes of some Republicans, no act could be too sleazy to stop the Clintons from returning to the White House – even acting like the Clintons themselves.



Clinton may want to talk today about the politics of meaning and connecting with voters on policy, but his legacy on issues is as faint a whisper as his own voice has become. But on savage partisanship and brazen defiance in the face of scandal, it roars as loud as it ever did.



THE RULEBOOK: FRIENDLY NEIGHBORS

“In times of insurrection, or invasion, it would be natural and proper that the militia of a neighboring State should be marched into another, to resist a common enemy, or to guard the republic against the violence of faction or sedition.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 29

TIME OUT: MORE THAN SURVIVAL

Cancer robbed author David Wong Louie of the ability to eat – the chewing and swallowing and tasting of food. He has survived the past six years taking sustenance through a feeding tube. He offers a powerful meditation on the meaning of eating. Harpers: “At home, in my kitchen, I watch the dog eat. She puts her head down and doesn’t come up for air until she’s emptied the bowl. All day she wants food, and as soon as food arrives, it’s gone. She has all that mouth, all those teeth, all that jaw, and she doesn’t chew, just mindlessly inhales the premium kibble. It’s textbook carnivore behavior, I know, brutal at its core, tear and swallow, take in the largest hunks that won’t choke you. All the dog does is ingest a substance for the sole purpose of loading up the gastrointestinal tract: the same joyless thing that I do. Breathe, I would tell her, if I could. Sniff. Relish the chicken-and-liver recipe. Chew.”

FRESH FAILURE BY TEAM TRUMP KEEP RUSSIA STORY ALIVE

AP: “A Russian-American lobbyist says he attended a June 2016 meeting with President Donald Trump’s son, marking another shift in the account of a discussion that was billed as part of a Russian government effort to help the Republican’s White House campaign. Rinat Akhmetshin confirmed his participation to The Associated Press on Friday. Akhmetshin has been reported to have ties to Russian intelligence agencies, though he denies ever working as an intelligence agent. He told the AP that he served in the Soviet military in a unit that was part of counterintelligence but was never formally trained as a spy. The meeting has heightened questions about whether Trump’s campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the election, which is the focus of federal and congressional investigations. … While [Donald] Trump Jr. has confirmed that Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya was in the meeting, he did not disclose Akhmetshin’s presence. The president’s son has tried to discount the meeting, saying that he did not receive the information he was promised.”



Claim: Offer of help with DNC dirt came days before hacked emails hit - Daily Caller: “A former Soviet military intelligence officer told the Associated Press on Friday that a Russian lawyer he accompanied to a June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower offered to provide information about illicit financial activity carried out by the Democratic National Committee. Nine days later, on June 18, Guccifer 2.0, the hacker believed to be a front for Russian spy agencies, dropped a bombshell. ‘NEW DOCS FROM DNC NETWORK: LOTS OF FINANCIAL REPORTS AND DONORS’ PERSONAL DATA,’ was the headline plastered across the Guccifer 2.0 website.”

Why Russian lawyer was in the US - CBS News: “In October 2015, [Natalia] Veselnitskaya represented Denis Katsyv in a money laundering suit against his company, Prevezon. … Veselnitskaya's application for a visa to travel to the U.S. to work on the case was denied, she said in a later court filing. Instead, the Department of Justice granted Katsyv and Veselnitskaya immigration parole. … The U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York granted Veselnitskaya immigration parole in October 2015, setting an expiration date of January 7, 2016, DOJ attorneys later told the court.”



Trump to put Washington ultra-insider atop Russia response team - Bloomberg: “President Donald Trump plans to put a veteran Washington lawyer, Ty Cobb, in charge of overseeing the White House’s legal and media response to investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign. Top administration officials want someone to enforce discipline in the White House regarding Russia matters -- and that includes the president, who frequently vents his frustrations about the investigations on Twitter, a White House official said.”

Gee thanks, bro… - Politico: “Jared Kushner [who reportedly revealed the existence of his brother-in-law’s undisclosed meeting] has been pressing other White House aides to more vigorously defend the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Kremlin-linked lawyer that Kushner also attended, but has faced resistance from some of Trump’s top press aides, according to six sources familiar with the matter. Four White House officials and two outside advisers say Kushner wants the White House to more aggressively push out surrogates and talking points to change the narrative around the latest twist in the Russia scandal.”

SENATE OBAMACARE CUTS DANGLING BY A THREAD

Politico: “Two GOP senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paulof Kentucky, said Thursday afternoon they will oppose a procedural vote next week to bring the bill to the floor. GOP leaders are putting immense pressure on about half a dozen other Republican senators not to join them and topple the entire effort. Another ‘no’ is enough to kill the bill, and would also likely lead to mass defections. The Trump administration is also lobbying intensely for the bill, the latest version of which was released Thursday. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator

Seema Verma spent Thursday trying to convince centrist senators to reconsider their opposition to prior drafts of the bill. Republicans are also hoping Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) can convince Sen.Mike Lee (R-Utah) to back the measure after Lee said it was ‘unclear’ if this version is better than the last. Majority Whip John Cornyn acknowledged GOP leaders don’t have the minimum 50 votes right now but insisted, ‘We're making good progress.’”



Senate Republicans exempt own health coverage from proposal -Vox: “Senate Republicans included a provision that exempts members of Congress and their staff from part of their latest health care plan. This exemption could have the effect of ensuring that members of Congress have coverage for a wider array of benefits than other Americans who purchase their own coverage. A Senate Republican aide confirmed that the exemption existed but was unable to comment as to the specific effect it would have. The aide said it was included to ensure that the bill hewed to the chamber’s strict reconciliation rules that limit the policies this health bill can include. The exemption is similar to the one that existed in the House health bill. After Vox reported on its existence, the House voted to close the loophole — and the Senate aide expected their chamber to follow the same path.”



Trump places pressure from France via Twitter storm - Politico:“President Donald Trump turned up the pressure Friday morning on Senate Republicans, urging them via Twitter to make good on a years-old campaign promise by passing legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare. … ‘Republicans Senators are working hard to get their failed ObamaCare replacement approved. I will be at my desk, pen in hand!’ Trump, who is in France attending Bastille Day celebrations with French President

Emmanuel Macron, wrote on Twitter Friday morning. ‘So impt Rep Senators, under leadership of @SenateMajLdr McConnell get healthcare plan approved. After 7yrs of O'Care disaster, must happen!’”



Five takeaways from the GOP's healthcare reboot - The Hill: “It includes a provision key to earning conservative support… An amendment pushed for weeks by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) could go a long way… Medicaid cuts are largely kept in place. … The updated legislation left the deep Medicaid cuts from the first version of the bill essentially unchanged… The bill includes more money to combat the opioid crisis. … $45 billion. … The bill keeps ObamaCare taxes on high earners. … Republicans reversed from their initial draft and decided to keep ObamaCare’s taxes on high earners. Much of ObamaCare would remain. … It keeps the structure of ObamaCare’s tax credits to help lower income Americans afford insurance in place, though they would be less generous. A tax on high earners would remain. In short, it’s not a straight repeal of the law.”



HOUSE VOTES TO KEEP TRANSGENDER MILITARY POLICIES

WashEx: “A majority in the House voted down a proposal to restrict funding for transgender members of the military, standing by social policy changes enacted by the Pentagon under former President Barack Obama. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., succeeded in forcing a vote, arguing that Obama's ‘transgender decision is costly in dollars and short on common sense.’ The attempted rollback failed on a 209-214 vote, however, as 24 Republicans joined a unanimous Democratic caucus in opposing the proposal. ‘The Obama transgender policy, which was implemented without input from members of Congress, is ill-conceived…’ Hartzler said in June. … Her amendment would have barred the Defense Department from ‘provid[ing] medical treatment (other than mental health treatment) related to gender transition’ to members of the military. Proponents of transgender military service argued that her proposal ‘would reduce military readiness’ by discouraging transgender Americans from serving.”

AUDIBLE: WE ARE FAMILY

“He’s a brother from a different mother.” – Former President

George W. Bush joked with former President Bill Clinton during a conversation at the graduation ceremony for the 2017 class of the Presidential Leadership Scholars Program.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“So, please explain to me why the Republican majority is compelled to bail out the ACA should a repeal/replace bill fail? If the Democrats won't participate, why not just let them own the failed system? Why must the Republicans come along and provide additional funds to save a system they had nothing to do with in the first place? Why not just let the failure play out and say ‘see, we told you so?’ After all, the Democrats made their bed, why not just let them sleep in it?” – Paul Sellers, Atascadero, Calif.



[Ed. note: Mr. Sellers, “see we told you so” is the single worst campaign motto I can imagine (maybe other than “I’m with her”). The people who would lose their health insurance or face crippling premium increases would not all be Democrats. There would be lots of Trump voters who were forced to abandon their old plans in favor of ObamaCare exchanges. Imagine that Republicans would say to them “we couldn’t figure out how to fix the program so you’re just going to have to suffer. But at least we were right eight years ago.” Democrats make a mistake by failing to present policy alternatives in the minority, but don’t kid yourself: If Republicans choke on this voters will have no hesitation about turning out incumbents again.]



“I'm befuddled... explain to me why the GOP majority can't just play a zero sum game and repeal [ObamaCare] outright without a full-scale [‘TrumpCare’] replacement? It seems so easy; all they have to do is hit the reset button, and the marketplace returns to 2009. If necessary, pass separate, one-off market reforms. E.g. separate bills for ideas such as plans across state lines, risk pools, a separate Medicaid fix that levels the playing field for all 50 states, etc. They stand or die on their own, let the chips fall where they may across party lines. This way, the GOP can walk away saying that they kept their promise. And yes, where are the cost comparisons not for what a GOP bill might spend, but what that cost is against leaving [ObamaCare] intact and how many millions lose complete access to any health insurance.” – Jeff Smith, Statesboro, Ga.



[Ed. note: It does seem so easy, Mr. Smith, until we remember that the Republicans do not agree among themselves what that replacement would look like. The problem here is not Democratic intransigence, its Republican disagreement. You can’t get 51 Republicans to vote for a repeal unless you can get them to agree on what the replacement is. There are a considerable number that would rather have the existing system than face the possibility that replacement legislation fails and leaves millions out of luck. One of the biggest fundamental changes for the Republican Party in 2016 was that it ceased to be the party opposed to guaranteed universal coverage when it nominated Donald Trump. No issue has animated the GOP more than health insurance in the past decade, but the party’s members nominated in that time first the author of the state-level model for the federal program who then shied away from too-harsh attacks on the law and then in 2016 a proponent of universal coverage. Whatever ways in which ObamaCare sputters, stutters and stalls the great success of the law, as it turns out, is in getting the Republican Party to accept as a federal obligation the provision of health insurance.]



“Hi Chris! Perhaps you can clear this up. It used to be, that Republican States were affiliated with the color Blue, and Democrat States, Red. When, why and how did that change?” – Bill Hodges, Oakland, Calif.



[Ed. note: Great question, Mr. Hodges! Like much of our modern political world it was the 2000 election that changed it. There had been no set convention for color coding the parties, and you are right that very often the GOP was depicted as the Blue Team. By 1992, most networks had settled on red for Republicans and blue for Democrats, presumably out of a herd mentality. But it wasn’t until 2000 that Americans really began to see themselves as living in red states or blue states. But, for anyone over the age of 25, they know why. As Florida hung in the balance between George W. Bush and Al Gore that color code became enormously important. The growth of online coverage and the obsession with charts and maps helped too.]



“I have been preaching the same thing for years, and I have to wonder what the local voter turn-out rates might be if more people took this advice to heart. I believe that the apathy toward national elections is harmful to our collective participation in the Great Self-Governance Experiment we’ve been engaged in for the last couple centuries. There is much wisdom to be gained from hearing from your local candidates at the county fair, like in the olden days…plus, you might run into some good barbeque! BTW, this is Thursday. Can’t wait to retrieve the White County News from the mailbox.” – Steve Smith, Cleveland, Ga.



[Ed. note: Hear, hear, Mr. Smith! Henry David Thoreau said “That government is best which governs least.” (No, it was not Thomas Jefferson, even if it sounds like him.) But it might better be said that if the government that governs best governs closest to its constituents. Some things, like raising an army, require the contributions of the entire country. But, our system envisions devolving decision making power, including on taxation and expenditure, to as close to the application as reasonably possible. Democrats are rediscovering their love of federalism as they battle with the Trump administration, but it has always been so that the more issues that can be resolved on the local and state level the better able to central government is to deal with its own unique set of issues.]

**SCREAMS SILENTLY**

Oregon Live: “In a scene straight out of your nightmares, a truck full of ‘slime eels’ lost its load Thursday on U.S. 101, causing a five-car crash, dousing sedans with goo and sending sea creatures slithering across vehicles and the highway. Technically, the fish were not eels, but hagfish, which have a skull but no jaw or spine and they secrete slime when distressed, earning them the nickname ‘slime eels.’ And distressed they were, emitting gooey stuff that will make you shiver in your sandals and that covered 101 along with the 7,500 pounds of fish. The Oregon State Police tweeted photos of extensively damaged, slimy sedans. It was a decidedly disgusting scene best avoided by travelers. … Also, according to smithsonianmag.com, to prevent choking on its own slime, a hagfish can ‘sneeze’ out its slime-filled nostril, and tie its body into a knot to keep the slime from dripping onto its face.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“I don't think it's illegal. I don't think anybody's claiming that it's illegal. But it does, the one thing it does do, it totally undermines a six-month story from the White House to which I was sympathetic that there wasn't any collusion. This was a bungled collusion.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.”

“Don Jr. did not collude with anybody to influence the election,” Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters at an off-camera briefing. “Bottom line is Democrats had a weak candidate.”

Donald Trump Jr. on Sunday acknowledged the June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer who has links to the Kremlin.

Trump Jr. has remained defiant and isn’t apologizing for the meeting, while the White House has presented a united front in defending the president’s son. However, Fox News has confirmed that lawyer Alan Futerfas has been hired to represent Trump Jr. in connection with the Russia probes.

On Monday night, The New York Times reported that Trump Jr. had received an email prior to the meeting in which he was allegedly told that the material being offered was part of a Russian government move to assist his father’s candidacy, according to three people familiar with the email.

The email sent to the president's son came from Rob Goldstone, a former British tabloid reporter who worked to coordinate the June 2016 meeting, the paper said.

Earlier Monday, Trump Jr. used a sarcastic tweet to mock The New York Times’ reporting on the meeting.

“Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent... went nowhere but had to listen,” the president’s son tweeted.

The reports, though, were causing new headaches for the Trump family with regard to congressional investigations, as a senior Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee said Monday the panel should now question Trump's eldest son.

Sen. Susan Collins of Maine told reporters that ""our intelligence committee needs to interview him and others who attended the meeting"" as part of the panel's probe into Russian interference in last year's election and possible collusion between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.

New York Sen. Charles Schumer also wants the president's son to explain his actions before Congress.

""Donald Trump Jr. must also testify before the committee to explain why three (people) of the highest level of the Trump administration thought it was appropriate to meet with a Russian source to receive information about a political opponent,"" Trump said.

The Times published a series of reports on the meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, leading to varying explanations from the Trump team. Trump’s eldest son initially said it was primarily about allowing Americans to adopt Russian children and “mentioned nothing about Mrs. Clinton.”

He later acknowledged he was told the Russian individual “might have information helpful to the campaign.”

During the meeting, Trump Jr. said in a statement, “the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton.” But he said her statements “were vague, ambiguous and made no sense” and it “became clear that she had no meaningful information.”

He said, “She then changed subjects and began discussing the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act. It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting.”

Trump Jr.’s meeting is the first confirmed private meeting between members of President Trump’s inner circle and a Russian national.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller as well as multiple congressional committees are investigating whether Russia interfered in the election in addition to possible collusion with the Trump campaign.

Trump arrived in the French capital after an overnight flight from Washington and hours before his meeting with Macron to tackle potential solutions to the crisis in Syria and broader counterterrorism strategies.

Trump's decision last month to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord sparked outrage across Europe and anti-Trump protests are planned while he is in Paris. Macron, a staunch advocate of research to combat global warming, has beckoned ""all responsible citizens,"" including American scientists and researchers, to bring their fight against climate change to France.

The leaders plan to hold a news conference after their talks, and Trump may face tough questions about emails revealing that his eldest son welcomed the prospect of receiving Russian government support in last year's presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton.

Trump came to his son's defense Wednesday, praising Donald Trump Jr.'s performance in an interview on Fox News Channel. Trump tweeted: ""He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!""

The visit to Paris could offer Trump a well-timed distraction from the controversy. He will mark the 100th anniversary of America's entry into World War I by visiting U.S. troops. He'll also be the guest of honor at Friday's Bastille Day events -- a celebration of French national pride. White House officials are casting it as a celebration of the U.S.-French military alliance -- both then and now.

The leaders and their wives will end a busy day of meetings Thursday with a lavish dinner at Jules Verne at the top of the Eiffel Tower.

Trump is visiting a city he has repeatedly disparaged. When he announced his decision on the climate agreement, Trump said he was ""elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris."" And he's repeatedly said the city has been ruined by the threat of terrorism, which he ties to immigrants.

""Paris isn't Paris any longer,"" he said in February.

But counterterrorism issues give Macron and Trump the potential for a strong working relationship.

Macron's national security pitch hasn't differed drastically from Trump's. On Syria, he argues for intervention, saying that President Bashar Assad is a threat to Syria and the Islamic State group is a threat to France. France has been plagued in recent years by extremist attacks. During last year's Bastille Day celebrations, a 19-ton cargo truck deliberately plowed into crowds in Nice, killing more than 80 people.

Macron supports intervention against Syria's government in response to its use of chemical weapons and could prove an important ally as the Trump administration seeks to increase pressure against Assad. But in doing so, they'll need to tackle the issue of Russia's support for Assad, something Trump has only passively acknowledged."

THE PROCESS IS THE PROBLEM

Your cousin Myron has moved to the town just up the road, only an hour’s drive away if there’s no traffic.

You haven’t seen Myron since the unfortunate incident with the cat, the sparklers and the paper tablecloth at the family picnic. It may have been 20 years, but family is family, even if you never liked his mother.

So when he calls with the news of his move, you say, “We should definitely get together.” Tragically, Myron believes you.

And so begins many months of you letting phone calls going to voicemail, ignoring Facebook messages and timing your return communications for moments you know Myron is most likely to be unavailable. You learn the sinking feeling that comes with the sound of a connected call at the other end of the line and a cheerful, “Hey cuz!”

You have done everything you can within the bounds of decency to let Myron know that the last thing you want to do with your Sunday is pack up the family truckster to take your brood up the road to spend it with Myron, his wife, Myra, Myron Jr. and little Mylene. But, as that cat learned so long ago, Myron is not the brightest sparkler in the pack.

You, friends, are the Republicans in Congress and Myron is ObamaCare repeal.

The latest effort for Republicans to try to avoid the campaign promise that served them so well but is now an impossibility goes by the excruciating nickname “skinny repeal,” which sounds like a kelp wrap cellulite treatment sold on late-night television.

Skinny repeal is not repeal. It is not even serious legislation. It is the equivalent of asking a child what he wants for Christmas and him simply handing you the catalogue and saying “all of it.”

The amendment, which is still unseen but described to members and reporters, is not a serious policy proposal. It is a dare. By keeping all of the popular parts of ObamaCare and repealing the means for enforcing and financing those programs, the government would not only dump huge burdens on taxpayers but also wreak havoc on insurance as we know it.

But, in a very Washington way, those selling the measure do so by promising that it will never become law. “Vote for this,” they say, “because it will never happen.”

We most recently saw this argument in full force when the same people urged Republicans to vote for a complete repeal of the law last year. You saw this week how that ended up.

It is not an unreasonable desire for the American people to want their representatives and senators to not vote for legislation they hope doesn’t go into effect. Voters are funny that way…

Tonight we’ll witness the ballyhooed “vote-a-rama,” in which any member can get a vote on any amendment followed by a robust 60-second debate on the subject. This is the legislative equivalent of those baby sea turtles trying to make it into the surf before the birds eat them all. Crunch.

Americans might be forgiven for growing increasingly cynical about the process. This evening will include fake debate on insincerely rendered amendments to a non-existent bill. It is not new in the sense that the legislative process has often been unseemly, but the subject matter tends to make this one a little different.

Democrats failed to keep the public trust in 2009 when they used stunt plays and hidden-ball tricks to advance a piece of legislation as large as ObamaCare. Republicans are compounding that error today.

In truth, the House-passed version of changes to the existing law isn’t a repeal or a replacement in any true sense, nor will be anything that comes out of the Senate, if they actually can find 51 votes tonight.

The goal here for Republican leaders is to first keep primary voters at bay by offering something that could, however tendentiously, be called a repeal and, second, keep alive a vehicle to address the looming disaster in the individual insurance market for 2018.

If lawmakers leveled with voters about what they were really doing, there would rightly be an uproar. Nothing would pass, leaving Republicans to choose between either letting millions face a loss of coverage or unaffordable premiums because of the past failures of the government or, go on bended knee to Democrats looking for help.

Republicans keep arguing that if they don’t pass something, even if it’s bad, that voters will punish them in the next election. What both parties seem to have forgotten is that voters have lately been in the habit of punishing both parties, turn by turn.

Each cycle brings a new low for good governance, and each cycle voters respond by punishing whoever is in charge. It is a race to the bottom in which the republic is the loser every time.

For both parties, the process has become the problem. Even cousin Myron could tell you that.

THE RULEBOOK: GOTTA START SOMEPLACE

“The real scarcity of objects in this country, which may be considered as productive sources of revenue, is a reason peculiar to itself, for not abridging the discretion of the national councils in this respect.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 36



TIME OUT: CLICK BEFORE YOU SQUISH

Atlantic: “The legendary naturalist John Muir once wrote: ‘Whenever I met a new plant, I would sit down beside it for a minute or a day, to make its acquaintance, hear what it had to tell.’ The first step to making an acquaintance is to get a name—and naming nature is not easy. …[Scott] Loarie and his team have developed an app that can help. Known as iNaturalist, it began as a crowdsourced community, where people can upload photos of animals and plants for other users to identify. But a month ago, the team updated the app so that an artificial intelligence now identifies what you’re looking at. In some cases, it’ll nail a particular species—it correctly pegged the dragonfly [Ed Yong] spotted as a slaty skimmer (Libellula incesta). For the butterfly, it was less certain. ‘We’re pretty sure this is in the genus Papilio,’ it offered, before listing ten possible species.”

I’LL TELL YOU WHAT: HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO US!

Wednesday was the one-year anniversary of “I’ll Tell You What” and what a year it has been… This week, Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt discuss President Trump's early morning tweets, transgender troops serving in the military and the health care bill in Congress. Plus, Dana shares her new salty snack and Chris makes his recommendations for a visit to “almost heaven,” West Virginia. LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HERE

MOOCH MEANS MORE CHAOS FOR WHITE HOUSE

Variety: “…Anthony Scaramucci, last night sent out a tweet in which he railed against the ‘felony’ leak of his financial disclosure form. … Scaramucci seemed to be accusing the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, of being the source of the leak. Then Scaramucci deleted the tweet, and in a new tweet said that assumption was ‘wrong!’ … But on Thursday morning, Scaramucci again called out Priebus. He called in to CNN’s ‘New Day’ with Chris Cuomo to again suggest that Priebus may be the leaker. ‘If you want to talk about the chief of staff, we have had odds, we have had differences,’ Scaramucci said. … ‘I don’t know if this is repairable or not, that will be up to the president. But he is the chief of staff. He is responsible for understanding and uncovering and helping me do that inside the White House, which is why I put that tweet out last night.’ ‘If Reince wants to explain he’s not a leaker, let him do that,’ he added.”

Behind the meltdown - Weekly Standard: “Did he have proof that Priebus was the leaker? Philip Rucker, who covers the White House for the Washington Post, tweeted: ‘Tensions between Scaramucci and Priebus are raw as ever, I’m told tonight. There’s a reason Mooch tagged Reince on FBI leak tweet.’ A short time later he added: ‘Some in White House are trying to build a case that Priebus is a leaker—‘a diagram’ charting leaks, per senior official—to show Trump.’ Scaramucci, it seemed, was trying to shoot the king—or at least publicly frame him. And he wasn’t shy about telling others at the White House that he believed Priebus had leaked the documents, though he couldn’t provide evidence to support his claims. Still, Scaramucci vowed to make Priebus pay.”

Major Mooch payday from China still awaiting okay from regulators - Politico: “The investment firm, which Scaramucci founded in 2005, is in the process of being sold to RON Transatlantic and Chinese conglomerate HNA Group. The sale, set in motion in January when Scaramucci was shedding his holdings in anticipation of landing an administration job, has drawn the scrutiny of regulators and is taking longer than expected to close. The interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is examining the deal to ensure that it carries no risk to national security. The panel’s review, which comes amid ramped-up scrutiny of business dealings with China, ultimately can be overruled by President Donald Trump.”

Hullo, luv - The [UK] Telegraph: “[BBC anchor Emily Maitlis] got the first UK interview with Anthony Scaramucci… The new White House employee, who has been in his new job for less than a week, spent the 11-minute interview repeatedly touching Maitlis's hand, gesticulating close to her face and apparently glancing at her chest.”

AIDES TRY TO SAVE TRUMP FROM HIMSELF ON SESSIONS

NYT: “Among those urging Mr. Trump to spare Mr. [Jeff Sessions] have been Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff; Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist; and Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, according to officials who asked not to be named describing internal deliberations. For the White House, the attacks on the attorney general have touched off a serious problem on Capitol Hill when it did not need any other headaches. Senate Republicans who almost never link arms in unison against a president from their party formed a cordon around Mr. Sessions, making it clear that they neither concurred with nor would tolerate Mr. Trump’s repeated threats to the attorney general’s tenure. Senate leaders made clear they would block Mr. Trump from replacing Mr. Sessions if he tried to do so during the coming recess.”

Grassley warns Trump: No A.G. replacement this year -

WashEx: “Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, strongly suggested on Wednesday night that he would not allow his panel to consider confirming a replacement this year for Attorney General Jeff Sessions if President Trump were to fire him. ‘Everybody in D.C. [should be] warned that the agenda for the judiciary [committee] is set for rest of 2017,’ Grassley, R-Iowa, wrote on Twitter. ‘Judges first subcabinet 2nd / AG no way,’ he added, with ‘AG’ referring to attorney general.”

Could Trump jam a recess appointment to replace Sessions? Not so fast… - WaPo: “…Trump has been talking privately about how he might replace Sessions and possibly sidestep Senate oversight, four people familiar with the issue said. Two of those people, however, described Trump as musing about the idea rather than outlining a plan of action, and a senior White House official said no action is imminent.”

Ken Starr on Sessions: ‘Mr. President, please cut it out’ - WaPo: “Tweet to your heart’s content, but stop the wildly inappropriate attacks on the attorney general. An honorable man whom I have known since his days as a U.S. attorney in Alabama, Jeff Sessions has recently become your piñata in one of the most outrageous — and profoundly misguided — courses of presidential conduct I have witnessed in five decades in and around the nation’s capital. What you are doing is harmful to your presidency and inimical to our foundational commitment as a free people to the rule of law.”

Kraushaar: Conservative Trump backers get a dose of their own medicine - National Journal: “The political world is going to find out, all over again, that most Republican voters will side with the president—even over Sessions, who provided political credibility to Trump at a critical time during the presidential primaries. Most Trump voters backed him because of his antiestablishment attitude, not his specific policies on immigration and trade. In the heat of the Sessions scandal, Trump continued to draw adoring fans in his Rust Belt base who could care less about his shabby treatment of the attorney general. Reporter Salena Zito, who has been chronicling blue-collar voter sentiment, wrote that Trump received a “hero’s welcome” in Youngstown, Ohio on Tuesday.”



The Judge’s Ruling: The case against Sessions - Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano slams the attorney general: “The president is frustrated because he wants to do what he was elected to do. Instead, the DOJ's lethargy and the independent counsel's zeal have him at bay.” More here.

Adios: Sessions to El Salvador - AP: “With his future as the nation’s top prosecutor in doubt after a week of blistering public scorn from the president, Attorney General Jeff Sessions flew to El Salvador Thursday seeking ways to stamp out the brutal street gang MS-13. As the Trump administration tries to build support for its crackdown on illegal immigration, it has increasingly tried to make the gang with Central American ties the face of the problem. Recent killings tied to its members have stoked the national debate on immigration.”

[Watch Fox: Tucker Carlson joins Sessions on his trip to Central America for an exclusive interview with the embattled attorney general. Watch “Tucker Carlson Tonight” at 8 pm ET.]

Stay swagin’ - “One of the worst things you can do to President Trump is to show insecurity. Sessions showed that. Reince has showed that.” – Senior administration official, talking to Fox News colleague Doug McKelway.

PUTIN FOE CALLS OUT U.S. ENABLERS

Business Insider: “A fierce but muted battle erupted last year between banker-turned human rights activist Bill Browder and the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which produced the explosive, unverified dossier that detailed President Donald Trump's alleged ties to and escapades in Russia. The feud escalated dramatically earlier this month, when news broke of a meeting between the president's son and a Russian lawyer named Natalia Veselnitskaya, who at the time was lobbying to repeal the law known as the Magnitsky Act. Veselnitskaya's relationship with Fusion's cofounder, Glenn Simpson, has been scrutinized by reporters trying to understand who she is, who she works for, and who works for her. The reporters have had help from Browder, who is known both for spearheading the Magnitsky Act through Congress in 2012 and his willingness to speak to the press.”

[You can read Browder’s gripping testimony for the Senate courtesy of The Atlantic.]

Congress set to squeeze Trump on Russia sanctions - Roll Call: “A bill to provide for new sanctions against three adversaries of the United States will be making its way to President Donald Trump’s desk before the August recess, after all. House and Senate negotiators reached an agreement late Wednesday to get the sanctions legislation against Iran, Russia and North Korea through the Senate without further amendment, avoiding a potential clash with the House.”

Mooch threatens veto - Roll Call: “President Donald Trump might veto a House-passed measure that would slap new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea so he can ‘negotiate’ tougher penalties against Moscow, says incoming White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci.”

TOP GENERAL SAYS TRUMP TRANS BAN TWEETS NOT POLICY

AP: “The nation’s top military officer says U.S. policy on transgender individuals serving in uniform has not — and will not — change until Defense Secretary Jim Mattis receives the president’s policy direction and Mattis determines how to implement it. Gen. Joseph Dunford is chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Dunford made the statement in a note Thursday to all service chiefs, commanders and enlisted military leaders. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the note. Dunford is responding to Trump's announcement on Twitter Wednesday that the government will not allow or accept transgender people in the military ‘in any capacity.’ Dunford says that for now, ‘we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect.’”

Trump’s attempted ban exceeded demands of social conservatives - AP: “Trump's tweets announcing the ban came as the administration and House GOP leaders were trying to work out a problem involving medical costs for service members seeking to transition to another gender while serving in the military, an issue that had created problems for a sweeping spending bill. Social conservatives, led by Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., were pressing for an amendment to the spending bill blocking funding for such costs, including reassignment surgery. The House narrowly defeated Hartzler's measure last week, yet she and other conservatives were trying to revive it. … According to a senior Republican aide, House leaders were taken by surprise when Trump announced the broader ban; they had been pressing for a more narrow response.

AUDIBLE: NOT EVEN SOPPRESSATA

“I’ll be on it like a hobo on a ham sandwich.” – Sen. John Kennedy R-La., talking to reporters about proposed legislation from GOP leaders on health insurance.

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“First let me say how much I look forward to reading your daily observations....and your wit. Help me see the light. A Democratic passed bill (ACA) is failing miserably and the Democrats are doing NOTHING, unless you count endless criticism, to help fix this catastrophe. Now, my question: why hasn't the GOP pointed out how uncooperative they have been in fixing the mess that THEY passed and how it's costing Americans every day... either out of their own pocket or in tax dollars being wasted to prop up the insurance industry. Every day they should loudly make this point.” – Michael Johnston, Humble, Texas

[Ed. note: With all the humility due in answering such a good question from a resident of Humble, Texas, I would suggest, Mr. Johnson, that they talk about it all the time. The president mentions it in every speech, press conference and interview. It is front and center in all the remarks made by Mitch McConnell and a permanent fixture in all GOP talking points. The problem is that Democrats learned too well the lesson from Republicans in the era of Obama. Voters did not punish the GOP for maximal obstruction of the 44th president’s agenda. Instead, they were rewarded. Democrats no doubt hope to obtain a similar result in 2018 and beyond.]

“President Trump appointed his attorney general. If he wants to remove him, he has the power to do so unilaterally. How could it be in his best interest to publicly badger and humiliate him? It does not seem to benefit his administration in any way. He is a businessman by experience - where is the profit?” – Randy Lariscy, Marietta, Ga.



[Ed. note: In the worst telling for the president, it is simply that he is not in control of himself. That’s sad and unsettling to think of. As you rightly point out, humiliating a senior cabinet official just for the sake of being cruel is an irrational act and would raise serious questions about the president’s temperament. The other possibility is less disturbing but more sinister: That Trump wants to force Sessions to resign so that Trump can try to force through an appointee who would kill the investigation into Trump’s own campaign. Having been burned by firing James Comey, Trump would be instead trying to force Sessions to pull the trigger himself so that it could not be said that the president had fired two people to end the probe that cover his conduct and that of his subordinates.]



“I was just wondering if there was any legal reason why Jeff Sessions could not resign as AG and then run in the Alabama Special Election in December to fill his Senate seat. Or has the filing deadline passed? How about write in? There just has to be a way to keep this good man around. He is getting a raw deal from DJT.” – Rick Gilbert, Viera, Fla.



[Ed. note: Well, you’re not the only one to have that idea, Mr. Gilbert. Rep. Mo Brooks R-Ala., who is running in the primary for the remainder of Sessions’ term, agrees with you. Brooks has proposed that if all nine of the candidates in the Republican race, including Brooks himself and sitting Sen. Luther Strange, appointed as an interim after Sessions departure, agree to drop out it would clear the way for Sessions to win the Republican nomination and, Alabama being Alabama, reclaim his seat in December. This smacks of something of a stunt for Brooks, but maybe an effective one. Sessions is very popular in the Yellowhammer State and Strange has been running as an absolute rubberstamp for Trump, who is also popular in Alabama. By taking Sessions’ side in the fight Brooks puts Strange in something of an awkward position.]

“Hi Chris, Am curious about when each of ‘the seven’ Senators who voted against [a measure to repeal ObamaCare two years from now] are up for reelection?” – Hope Councill, Chapel Hill, N.C.



[Ed. note: We don’t know who would or wouldn’t run for re-election, but here are the ending years for the terms of those seven senators: Rob Portman, R-Ohio, 2022; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, 2022; John McCain, R-Ariz., 2022; Lamar Alexander R-Tenn., 2020; Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., 2020; Shelley Moore Capito, R-W. Va., 2020; Susan Collins, R-Maine, 2020; and Dean Heller, R-Nev., is running for re-election next year.]

AP: “It was a woolly ride, but three wild rabbits managed to escape rising floodwaters in New Zealand by clambering aboard sheep and surfing to safety on their backs. Ferg Horne, 64, … was trudging through pelting rain to rescue a neighbor's 40 sheep from the floodwaters on Saturday at their South Island farm near Dunedin when he spotted some dark shapes from a distance. … Then he saw the bedraggled rabbits hitching a ride — two on one sheep and a third on another sheep. … He said the rabbits looked like they'd gotten wet but seemed quite comfortable and relaxed atop their mounts. Rabbits are considered a pest to farmers in New Zealand, and Horne said that typically when he sees one, he shoots it. ‘But they'd showed so much initiative, I thought they deserved to live, those rabbits,’ he said.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“You don’t release a policy like this and make a reversal without having an answer to the simple questions, such as are you going to withdraw people right now in the field who are transgender. It’s like the release of the executive order on immigration where they had no answer on what do you do with the person with the green card... This is not how you run a railroad no matter how you feel about the underlying issue. This is really bizarre.” –Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.”

CONGRESS RETURNS TO OBAMACARE AND OTHER KEY ISSUES WITH FAST-APPROACHING DEADLINES

Congress returns from its July 4 recess Monday with Republicans hard-pressed to accomplish a number of legislative goals in short order — and their top-priority, a health care bill, in jeopardy of collapsing. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., sounded a dire note Sunday about the passage of any plan the GOP-controlled Senate has in the works to repeal and replace ObamaCare. Meanwhile, Congress has other pressing issues, including passing tax reform, spending bills and a budget before the September 30 deadline for the federal government to technically run out of money. And with lawmakers having just three weeks of work before an August recess, some Republicans are suggesting cancelling or at least shortening the break.

While lawmakers in Alaska have doubled down on calls for improved U.S. defense in the wake of a North Korea ICBM test, some have appeared to shrug off the threat seemingly posed by the rogue regime. “I’m worried about moose, not missiles,” Anchorage Mayor Ethan Berkowitz told The Washington Post in a story published Saturday. “Bears, not bombs.” According to the paper, Alaska’s past may have something to do with its mellow response to the possibility of an attack from North Korea. An Alaskan town was bombed in 1942 during World War II and in the same week Japan occupied two Aleutian Islands. Alaska was also on alert during the Cold War with its incredibly close proximity to Russia. Some Alaskan homes still have fallout shelters.

The Washington Post reports the charges were dropped Monday after the Drug Enforcement Administration determined Adam Eidinger been carrying less than 2 ounces (57 grams) of pot, the legal limit in Washington, April 20. Eidinger led the ballot initiative that made pot legal in Washington.

Attorney's office spokesman Bill Miller confirmed the charges were dropped.

Eidinger's attorney, Mark Goldstone, says it was ""bogus"" from the beginning as it took months to decide Eidinger had less than 2 ounces.

Authorities say Eidinger's trial Sept. 11 is for charges from another protest when activists more clearly violated federal law smoking marijuana on federal property.

Chris Christie, no stranger to political snafus, may have made his ultimate mistake on Election Night last November, resulting in his removal from then President-elect Trump’s transition team, according to a new book.

In “Devil's Bargain,” author Joshua Green recounts adviser Steve Bannon’s relationship with Trump, but also details Christie’s falling out with the president.

The Daily Mail, citing the book, reported that Trump became irate after Christie offered to use his own mobile phone to set up a congratulatory call to Trump from then-President Barack Obama.

The idea apparently annoyed Trump, who responded: “You know my number, just give it to the president, I don't want your f---ing phone.”

Just days after the election, Christie was removed as head of Trump’s transition team, replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence.

But Christie slammed the book’s account Tuesday during an interview with MSNBC’s ""Deadline: White House"" with Nicole Wallace.

“First off, the book is wrong fundamentally, and there was no call from President Obama that evening to me. I didn’t speak to the president that night at all,” Christie said.

Christie said he accepted a call from Obama’s staff as results turned in Trump’s favor.

“If your guy happens to win, how do I get the president in touch with your guy?"" the caller asked, according to Christie.

“I said, ‘Just call my phone and I’ll give you his number,’'' Christie recalled. “I turned to the president — to the now-president, to the then-candidate — after that call, and said, ‘By the way, I think they figure at the White House you’re going to win because they’re calling and asking how to get in touch with you after that happens.’ And he was happy about that.”

Defending the President

Whatever happened that night, Christie apparently harbors no hard feelings toward the president. When Wallace asked Christie about the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr., Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya and others, Christie expressed sympathy for the president’s eldest son, saying Trump Jr. was “by no means a sophisticated political actor.”

“This is a guy who loves his father and got involved in politics because his father got involved,” Christie said. “But I don't think Don would have gotten involved at that level any other time.”

President Trump took to Twitter on Monday to defend his son, drawing criticism from Wallace. But Christie saw the move as a case of Trump being Trump.

""That's our guy,"" Christie said. ""I'm proud he is the president.”

Booed at the ballpark

As if the interview weren’t enough, Christie was back in the spotlight Tuesday night, during a ballgame between the New York Mets and St. Louis Cardinals.

The governor, an avowed Mets fan, made a one-handed grab of a foul ball during the game at New York’s Citi Field, but drew boos from the crowd – even though he gave the ball to a young fan seated nearby.

Christie had recently taken heat after photos surfaced showing him and his family sunbathing on a closed beach during a state-government shutdown over Fourth of July weekend.

Commentators at the ballgame used the foul ball as an opportunity to take a jab at the governor.

“A souvenir for Chris Christie ... are you kidding me? Good to see he got from the beach chair to the ballpark,” said one commentator, referencing the recent beach scandal, according to the Daily Mail."

On the roster: Congress returns facing major time crunch - GOP faces critical month for budget - Twist in the Comey case - Russia meetings, then and now - B-I-N-G-NO!



CONGRESS RETURNS FACING MAJOR TIME CRUNCH

NYT: “Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, told his Republican colleagues that they needed to vote on their health bill before the July 4 holiday — then he gave them an extension. … The process could drag on past July, but there is tremendous pressure for Congress to act quickly. Republicans chose to pass their health bill through a special budget process called reconciliation, which has a lot of rules. That choice has advantages — most important, it allows Republicans to avoid a filibuster and pass the legislation with 50 Senate votes (and a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence), without any of the Democrats. But it also means that the health bill impedes other priorities. Leaders want to use the same budget procedure to pass tax reform, but Senate rules allow only one such reconciliation maneuver at a time. That means that, as long as health care drags on, tax reform can’t move forward, unless Republicans can attract Democratic support under normal procedure (where 60 votes is needed for a filibuster-proof majority).”

Senators still aren’t agreeing - NY Mag: “At least ten Republican senators are thought to be ‘no’ votes on the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, and the number could rise after the lawmakers reflect on the sour public assessments of the bill they heard back home and read about in the media over the recess. Senators John McCain of Arizona and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana offered negative assessments of BCRA’s chances of enactment on Sunday shows. Senators Chuck Grassley and Ted Cruz — of Iowa and Texas — are sniping at each other over the latter’s proposed amendment to let insurers offer cheaper health plans with less coverage and its impact on people with preexisting conditions. Worse yet from a morale point of view, Republicans are now openly sparring over what to do if BCRA fails.”

The reality of the Cruz-Lee amendment - National Review: “While the text of the [Ted Cruz]-[Mike Lee] proposal is not available, the reasons the senators are pushing it seem clear enough from news stories. … The implication is that insurers could charge whatever premiums they wanted for their non-compliant plans. In particular, this would mean healthy consumers could buy policies with premiums adjusted based on their lower risk of needing expensive care. An amendment of this kind would have the predictable effect of segmenting the individual insurance market. Insurers would sell low-premium plans to healthy consumers outside of the ACA’s exchanges. The non-compliant plans would likely omit coverage for expensive benefits such as mental-health coverage, and might even limit the total amount of the insurance benefit either annually or over a lifetime.”



GOP faces critical month for budget - The Hill: “Congress has just three legislative weeks before the August recess and one month after that before an impending government shutdown and debt ceiling breach … neither the House nor the Senate’s budget committees have unveiled their budgets, which set the spending levels for the next fiscal year. The problem is division within the Republican caucus, which is being pulled in opposing directions by defense hawks, deficit hawks and moderates. The House Budget Committee, which has twice delayed marking up its resolution, had agreed on spending $621 billion on defense and $511 billion on other areas. Both totals were higher than Trump’s proposed caps of $603 billion for defense and $462 billion for nondefense.”



Freedom Caucus plan for the debt ceiling - Axios: “One conservative group that will announce a set of demands for the debt ceiling is the House Freedom Caucus. Sources tell [Jonathan Swan] Mark Meadows and his group of some 40 members will call on Republican leadership to pass a bill in July to deal with the debt ceiling and avoid a last-minute stand-off in October. … Democrats are very unlikely to support the Freedom Caucus' first plan, meaning there's no path to 60 votes in the Senate. Also, a number of Treasury officials, past and present, believe asset sales are not a viable way to avoid or delay raising the debt limit.”

THE RULEBOOK: THICK SKIN

“There is scarcely anything that can wound the pride or degrade the character of an independent nation which we do not experience.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 15



TIME OUT: REVIVING THE PAST

NatGeo: “Jurassic Park imagined a future in which it was possible to bring dinosaurs back to life. Now, that fiction may become reality as geneticists seek to resurrect the woolly mammoth. … The shaggy animals went extinct about 4,000 years ago, but the current revolution in genetics — which is combating aging, eradicating diseases, and even allowing parents to create ‘designer babies’ — may change that. In his new book, Woolly: The True Story Of The Quest To Revive One Of History’s Most Iconic Extinct Species, Ben Mezrich goes from the laboratory to the Siberian steppe as scientists explore the possibilities of reviving the woolly mammoth to its native lands—and possibly, threatened ecosystems along with it. … ‘The stuff [Michael Crichton] was doing in Jurassic Park is now scientifically possible. … It allows us to place individual genes that code for specific characteristics into the genome of living creatures. That’s what’s happening in the Woolly Mammoth Project. It used to be that we were reading DNA. Now we are at the point where we can write it,’ [Mezrich said.]”

TWIST IN THE COMEY CASE

The Hill: “More than half of the memos former FBI Director James Comey wrote as personal recollections of his conversations with President Trump about the Russia investigation have been determined to contain classified information, according to interviews with officials familiar with the documents. …when the seven memos Comey wrote regarding his nine conversations with Trump about Russia earlier this year were shown to Congress in recent days, the FBI claimed all were, in fact, deemed to be government documents. While the Comey memos have been previously reported, this is the first time there has been a number connected to the amount of memos the ex-FBI chief wrote. Four of the memos had markings making clear they contained information classified at the secret or confidential level, according to officials directly familiar with the matter. A spokesman for the FBI on Sunday declined to comment.”

RUSSIA MEETINGS, THEN AND NOW

Trump son met with Russian lawyer who allegedly offered Hillary dirt - WaPo: “Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, said in a statement Sunday that a Russian lawyer with whom he met in June 2016 claimed she could provide potentially damaging information about his father’s likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. He said he had agreed to the meeting at Trump Tower in New York because he was offered information that would be helpful to the campaign of his father, then the presumptive GOP presidential nominee. At the meeting, which also included the candidate’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, the Russian lawyer opened by saying she knew about Russians funding the Democratic National Committee and Clinton, the statement said. … Donald Jr. said that his father ‘knew nothing of the meeting or these events’ and that the campaign had no further contact with the woman after the 20- to 30-minute session.”

Kremlin denies the meeting - AP: “The Kremlin, meanwhile, is disavowing knowledge of the Russian lawyer, or any meeting between Trump senior staff and the woman. The meeting with Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya is the earliest known private meeting between key aides to the president and a Russian. Federal and congressional investigators are probing whether Trump's campaign coordinated with Russia to meddle in the presidential election, investigations the president has called a ‘hoax.’”

Trump tweets about G-20 interactions with Putin - WashTimes: “On his first day back in the White House on Sunday, Mr. Trump felt compelled to respond to his critics. In six Twitter posts, the president defended his performance in his first face-to-face meeting with Mr. [Vladimir Putin] … ‘I strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it. I’ve already given my opinion,’ Mr. Trump tweeted. ‘We negotiated a cease-fire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!’

‘Putin looked Trump in the eye and lied to him’ - Former U.S. Ambassador to the UN, John Bolton writing for the Daily Telegraph: “Before Donald Trump’s meeting with Vladimir Putin at the G20, media speculation approached hysterical levels. Would it be like the Reagan-Gorbachev get-together at Reykjavik in 1986, or Chamberlain meeting Hitler in Munich in 1938? Of course, it was like neither. Instead, the encounter was primarily for the leaders to take each other’s measure.”

WHEC: “A new state law changing the minimum age for bingo players is now in effect. As of Sunday, you must be 18-years-old to play bingo. Previously, there was no age for playing, you just had to be with an adult. The State Gaming Association says the law was updated to bring the minimum age for bingo in line with other forms of legal gambling. ‘Grandparents that are regular customers, especially during the summer months, they do bring grandkids and younger teenagers in and they do play,’ says Bob Gabbey of the Lancaster Knights of Columbus, ‘With this new law coming into effect, that's going to severely impact our clientele.’ Kids younger than 18 still can go to bingo games, but they cannot play.”

Follow Her On Twitter At']",FOX News,"One of the key figures named in the unverified anti-Trump dossier has delivered a point-by-point rebuttal shooting down more than a dozen allegations contained in its pages.

Fox News obtained a letter to the House Intelligence Committee sent Aug. 14 by the attorney representing Michael Cohen, who has served as President Trump's personal attorney. In it, he discredits the 35-page dossier, noting that without the “sensational allegations” contained in the document, Cohen “would not be involved” in the committee’s Russia probe.

“We have not uncovered a single document that would in any way corroborate the Dossier’s allegations regarding Mr. Cohen, nor do we believe that any such document exists,” Cohen’s attorney, Stephen Ryan, wrote in the letter.

Cohen's name has been in headlines this week after an email surfaced in which he wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin's press secretary about a possible ""Trump Tower"" in Moscow.

The dossier is a separate issue, and is known more for the salacious and unfounded allegations made against Trump. But Cohen was also named, and the letter said he “vehemently denies” all allegations, calling them ""totally false."" The letter noted that based on Cohen’s “proffered responses” to the allegations, they did not believe an interview or testimony with the committee was “warranted.”

The first allegation Ryan rejected was that Cohen had “secret meeting/s with Kremlin officials in August 2016” in Prague, stating that Cohen had “never traveled to Prague, Czech Republic, as evidenced by his passport” and “did not participate in meetings with Kremlin officials in Prague in August 2016.” When the dossier was first published by Buzzfeed in January, Cohen tweeted “I have never been to Prague in my life. #fakenews.”

Ryan went on to deny allegations that Cohen had traveled to Moscow to meet with “officials from the PA Legal Department” in August 2016 to “clean up the mess” of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s “corrupt relationship with pro-Russian Yanukovych regime in Ukraine and Trump foreign policy advisor, Carter Page’s secret meetings in Moscow with senior regime figures in July 2016.”

Ryan denied allegations that Cohen played “a key role in the secret Trump campaign/Kremlin relationship,” and said he was “not aware” of any such “fictitious relationship.”

“Mr. Cohen has never ‘engaged with Russians’ in an attempt to conceal or suppress information about Paul Manafort, Carter Page, or anyone else,” Ryan wrote.

The dossier also alleged that Cohen’s wife was of Russian descent and that her father was a “leading property developer in Moscow.” Ryan denied the “implication” of the statement as “both offensive and patently absurd,” stating that Cohen’s wife was from Ukraine and moved to the United States when she was five years old, and that his father in law is not a leading developer in Moscow, “nor does he own a dacha in Russia.”

RUSSIAN ATTORNEY RIPS ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER AS 'CHEAP GOSSIP,' AMID QUESTIONS OVER ORIGIN

“Mr. Cohen is not aware of any impropriety relating to Mr. Trump’s ‘relationship’ with Russia, nor is he aware of Mr. Trump having any improper political relationship with officials of the Russian Federation,” Ryan said.

The dossier has gotten renewed attention ever since a Senate witness testified last month that the company involved in commissioning the dossier, Fusion GPS, was at the same time working with a Russian attorney on what he called a “smear campaign” against him.

Bill Browder, CEO of Hermitage Capital, testified that Natalia Veselnitskaya hired Fusion GPS in that effort. Veselnitskaya is the same attorney who brokered a meeting at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort in June 2016.

FIRM WORKED ON TRUMP DOSSIER WHILE FIGHTING SANCTIONS FOR PUTIN-TIED FAMILY, KEY WITNESS SAYS

In an email to Fox News last week, Veselnitskaya acknowledged that Fusion GPS was hired by “our lawyers” from law firm Baker Hostetler to look into Browder’s background and connections with allegations against her client, but distanced herself from the dossier.

“When I read some parts of this ‘dossier’ in the media I laughed,” Veselnitskaya told Fox News. “What kind of idiots does one have to take Americans for to think they can believe that stupid and incompetent [and] absurd [dossier]?”

She went onto slam the dossier as “cheap gossip” and “tall tales.”

Fusion GPS acknowelegded the timeline matched, but said the two were ""separate"" projects.

Co-founder of Fusion GPS Glenn Simpson met with Senate Judiciary Committee staff behind closed doors on Capitol Hill for hours last week to give a transcribed interview. Fusion GPS told Fox News they turned over “more than 40,000 documents” to the committee for their investigation, but a committee spokesperson told Fox News that nearly 7,500 pages were blank.

Donald Trump Jr. is expected to meet with that same committee next month.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to ""Hannity,"" and this is a ""Fox News Alert."" Donald Trump Jr., is here tonight to set the record straight about his June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer. He will join us for an exclusive in-depth interview. That's coming up in just a minute.

And by the way, for all the members of the destroy media that have to tune into my show tonight, get out your pad and your pen. You may actually learn a thing or two. And we have a message for you, so maybe you want to take notes. Now, we're going to lay out the real scandals that you are not covering that you should be covering. If you were actual journalists, you would be.

But first, let's lay out the facts of this story. And that is tonight's very important ""Opening Monologue.""

All right, so earlier today after The New York Times started reporting on the content of email exchanges prior to this meeting at Trump Tower, Donald Trump Jr., released what he says is the entire email chain. Now, contact was initiated by Rob Goldstone. He's a music publicist who represents a Russian pop star who knows the Trump family from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant that took place in Moscow.

And on June 3, 2016, Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr., quote, ""Good morning. Emin"" -- the Russian pop star -- ""just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting. The crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high-level and sensitive information, but is part of Russia and its government support for Mr. Trump, helped along by Aras and Emin. So what do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly? I can also send this information to your father via Rhona, but it's ultrasensitive so wanted to send to you first. Best, Bob Goldstone.""

About 20 minutes later, Donald Trump, Jr., replied, quote, ""Thanks, Bob. I appreciate it. I am on the road at the moment, but perhaps I just speak to Emin first. Seems we have some time and if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer. Could we do a call first thing next week when I am back? Best, Don.""

And in following emails, the two go back and forth about setting up that phone call. And then they eventually work out a time for a sit-down meeting with this Russian lawyer.

Now, Donald Trump Jr., also released a statement earlier today explaining that he was releasing the emails to be transparent. He also detailed why he took the meeting.

His statement reads, in part, quote, ""The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was political opposition research. I first wanted to just have a phone call, but when that didn't work out, they said the woman would be in New York and asked if I would meet. I decided to take the meeting. The woman, as she has said publicly, was not a government official. As we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act. To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue. As Rob Goldstone said just today in the press, the entire meeting was the most inane nonsense I have ever heard. And I was actually agitated by it.""

In addition to all of that, the Russian lawyer at the center of this story spoke to NBC News where she denied working for the Russian government. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, NBC NEWS)

KIER SIMMONS, NBC CORRESPONDENT: Have you ever worked for the Russian government? Do you have connections to the Russian government?

NATALIA VESELNITSKAYA, RUSSIAN ATTORNEY (through translator): No.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: Now, NBC is also quoting the Russian lawyer as saying, quote, ""I never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton. It was never my intention to have that."" And in a previous statement, Donald Trump Jr. said the same thing, that the lawyer never produced solid information about Hillary Clinton. In fact, he says she didn't even really make sense when talking about Clinton.

And it's worth noting, by the way, that President Trump's legal team pointed out that they think the whole meeting could have been a setup that was made to look like potential Russia collusion. Now, the legal team also says that this Russian lawyer is connected to Fusion GPS, which is the opposition research firm that produced the discredited Christopher Steele dossier on Donald Trump.

And by the way, as The New York Post has reported, Fusion GPS has several ties to the Democrats, including Clinton allies and even Planned Parenthood.

So from looking at the facts as we have them, a friend of the Trumps offered to coordinate a meeting to share opposition research on Hillary Clinton, which Donald Trump, Jr., agreed to. Nothing came of it because there was no information exchange. And it ended there.

Democrats, the mainstream media are right now hysterical over the story. By the way, we're glad you're all watching. But they have completely ignored an example of actual election interference, and I would argue probably because it involves a Democrat. So to be fair to you, the American people, tonight -- and we want to be balanced -- we need to point this out.

And the question you people in the media need to start asking yourselves is, why don't you tell the American people every story? For example, back in January, the Politico, hardly members of the right-wing conspiracy, published this explosive report. Quote, ""Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire."" Now, the report there lays out how a DNC operative and Ukrainian government officials tried to aid and assist Hillary Clinton and damage Donald Trump.

Now, this DNC operative, who according to Politico used to work at the Clinton White House, well, spearheaded this entire effort, including by meeting with Ukrainian officials at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, D.C., to discuss ways to go after former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Now, this operative even told Politico the Ukraine diplomats were, quote, ""helpful"" in tracking leads.

And then there's this bombshell. Quote, ""She occasionally shared her findings with officials from the DNC and Clinton's campaign."" And on top of all of that, the operative claims that she gave guidance and off the record information to, quote, a lot of journalists who were writing about Paul Manafort and Donald Trump's potential ties to Russia.""

Now that you, our audience, have evidence from both sides, you got to decide for yourself. We report, you decide. What's worse? And I'll pose this question to everybody in the media that's forced to tune in tonight. Which is worse? Why haven't you covered that story? And better yet, well, why didn't news organizations extensively report on Ukrainian collusion? Now, Politico -- they did all the heavy lifting for you. All you had to do was follow up.

Is it because many of the so-called top news organizations in this country exposed before the election as having colluded with the Clinton campaign? Remember WikiLeaks? And if you're interested, really interested in election interference, why didn't you care that a congressional investigation found in 2014 an Israeli political group used a $300,000 Obama State Department grant to create a political apparatus to try and defeat our ally, our friend, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu? Or how about the WikiLeaks email that shows a Clinton a campaign ad talking about how a Chinese ambassador wanted to have a private off-the- record meeting?

So in other words, do you members of this corrupt media, do you even know about these stories? And by the way, since you are so interested in prosecuting people and accusing them of crimes, well, let's talk about real crimes that have been committed that you in the media so often ignore.

Hillary Clinton -- let's see. We know she mishandled and destroyed top secret special access program classified government information. But what about a real Russian collusion conspiracy? That's the Uranium One deal. Remember, as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, she signed off on giving up to 20 percent of America's uranium to Vladimir Putin and the Russians. And all those people in the deal? Well, they kicked back over $100 million to the Clinton Foundation. And by the way, Bill Clinton doubled his speaking fees in Moscow.

And let's not forget the Clinton Foundation. They took millions of dollars from countries that have the most atrocious human rights records.

And how about a Senate report showing that the Trump administration has had to deal -- since he took office, the president --with 125 deep state leaks in 126 days, which, by the way, are all likely felonies and happened at a rate which is seven times greater than the previous two administrations.

What about Lieutenant General Michael Flynn? You all followed the story. Have you been reporting on the fact that he was unmasked and that intel, raw intelligence, was leaked to the press? Well, that would be a crime.

Then there's James Comey, a report from The Hill saying that four of Comey's seven memos contained classified information and that the considers the memos to be government property, meaning that Comey may have committed two felonies, broken the law, removing those files from the FBI.

Now, I'll end it on this note to the mainstream media. You have zero credibility left. You have been caught time and time again spreading fake news stories -- you'll be critical of all my interviews -- and you carry out your personal attacks against the president, against his family and anybody that dares to be associated with the president.

By the way, here's just one minor small example. Liberal Joe, NBC -- what has he called the president of the United States? A schmuck, a goon, a thug, mentally unhinged. And then the president fights back a little and you in the mainstream media, are you proud of how NBC News handles things, or CNN? My guess is you probably have defended all this.

Since, really, the media in America today, we have an information crisis -- overpaid, lazy, rigid left-wing ideologues. But that's for another night.

Tonight, we have Donald Trump, Jr. We will ask him every single question I can think of on this topic.

Don Jr., good to see you. Welcome back.

DONALD TRUMP JR.: Good to be here.

HANNITY: Appreciate it.

TRUMP JR.: I didn't know there was any time left.

(LAUGHTER)

HANNITY: I've been told that before, but they're highly rated opening monologues...

TRUMP JR.: I like it.

HANNITY: ... and I figured while I have a captive audience, I wanted to get my points out to them.

Let's start with the emails. Let's start with the first email. First of all, let's talk about, who is Rob Goldstone?

TRUMP JR.: Rob Goldstone is a talent manager for Emin Agalarov, who's an Azerbaijani Russian singer, who performed at Miss Universe, and later performed at the WGC (ph) championship golf course tournament that we held at Doral.

HANNITY: All right. So do you know ...

TRUMP JR.: I met him through that, through the golf course. I wasn't even at the Miss Universe pageant, but I met him throughout (ph) there, so I had a casual relationship.

HANNITY: With him. OK. So he sends you this email. We'll put it back up on the screen, and give you a chance to look at this. This is the one that says the crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father, meaning Emin's father, and in their meeting, offered to provide the Trump campaign with documents, information that could incriminate Hillary Clinton, et cetera. Obviously, highly sensitive information. But it's part of Russia and its government's support of Mr. Trump. And then they ask the best way to handle this.

This email comes in. What are you thinking?

TRUMP JR.: Honestly, my takeaway, when all of this was going on, is that someone has information on our opponent. You know, things are going a million miles an hour. You know what it's like to be on a campaign. We just won Indiana, but we're talking about a contested convention. Things are going a million miles an hour again. And Hey, wait a minute, I've heard about all these things, but maybe this is something. I should hear him out.

HANNITY: OK. When you read the parts about the Russian government, or Russia supporting your father, did that put off any sirens in your head?

TRUMP JR.: Honestly, I don't know. I mean, I think -- this was, again, just basic information that was going to be possibly there. I didn't know these guys well enough to understand that if this talent manager from Miss Universe, you know, had this kind of thing -- so I wanted to hear him out and play it out and see what happens. But you know, people are trying to reach out to you all the time with this.

HANNITY: All right. So you spent a lot of time talking about, and you actually said at one point that, Hey, if it turns out to say what you say it is...

TRUMP JR.: Of course.

HANNITY: What did you think it might be?

TRUMP JR.: Listen, I'd been reading about scandals that people were probably underreporting for a long time. So maybe it was something that had to do with one of those things. I mean, this is her perhaps involvement with the Russian government.

So you know, again, I didn't know there was any credibility. I didn't know if there was anything behind it. I can't vouch for the information. You know, someone sent me an email. I can't help what someone sends me, you know? I read it. I responded accordingly. And if there was something interesting there -- I think that's pretty common.

HANNITY: What about the timeline of this? This is pre, for example, WikiLeaks and the DNC emails...

TRUMP JR.: Well, honestly, this is pre, like, Russia fever. This is pre Russia mania. You know, this is 13 months ago, before I think the rest of the world was talking about that, trying to build up this narrative about Russia. So I don't even think my sirens, you know, went up or the antennas went up at this time because of it because it wasn't the issue that it's been made out to be over the last, you know, nine months, ten months since it really became a thing. So I think there is an element of context to that. At the time, it wasn't this big news story.

HANNITY: Right. What did you know about Emin -- Emin's father? What did you know about them from Moscow? Was it just the pageant you met them at and the Doral concert...

TRUMP JR.: That they had the pageant and they're successful real estate developers over there. So you know, that's the extent of, you know, my knowledge with them. I'd met Emin one or twice and you know, maintained a casual relationship there, talked about some potential deals, and then (ph) to that (ph) the extent of it. They really didn't go anywhere.

HANNITY: What do you know about this Russian lawyer? What did you, at the time, if anything ...

TRUMP JR.: I actually didn't know anything about it. Again, an acquaintance, you know, sent me this email. As a courtesy to him, I said, OK, let's meet. But I didn't know who I was meeting beforehand, never heard of the person, never got the information until they were in the room.

HANNITY: At any point, were you told either in a phone conversation or otherwise, what they might tell you, what Goldstone seemed to be implying you would receive?

TRUMP JR.: No. As I recall, it was all basically this email coordination. Let's try to set up a meeting and see what happens, and that it was going to be interesting information. And you know, in the end, it wasn't about that at all.

HANNITY: Let's go into the meeting.

TRUMP JR.: Yes.

HANNITY: All right. So you meet at Trump Tower.

TRUMP JR.: Yes.

HANNITY: OK, the meeting was described earlier today on ""The Today"" show.

TRUMP JR.: Uh-huh.

HANNITY: Did she describe it accurately?

TRUMP JR.: I think fairly accurately. I mean, I was a little taken aback by her saying -- you know, talking about me pressing for the information. But as you can see from the emails, the pretext of the meeting was, Hey, we have information. And there was, you know, some small talk. I don't even remember what it was. It just was sort of nonsensical, inane and garbled, and then quickly went on to, you know, a story about Russian adoption and how we could possibly help. And really, that's when we shut it down, which is, Wait a second, what does this have to do with what we were talking about?

HANNITY: Did you even know what the Magnitsky Act was?

TRUMP JR.: I'd never even heard of it before, you know, that day. You know, I think it became pretty apparent to, you know, Jared and Paul, who -- I think Jared left after a few minutes. Paul got on the phone...

HANNITY: Well, she said that, yes.

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP JR.: I do remember that. We were all there. I was basically sitting there, listening as a courtesy to my acquaintance who had set up the meeting. And you know, in his own words, you can hear what he said, and you played it earlier, about it. I mean, he apologized to me walking out of the meeting basically for wasting my time.

HANNITY: Well, and he did say -- at the end of your statement today, you did point out, as Goldstone said today, the entire meeting was the most inane nonsense I've ever heard. And I'm actually, you know, agitated by it.

TRUMP JR.: Yes. Listen, I...

HANNITY: And he called -- he called and apologized to you?

TRUMP JR.: No ...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP JR.: There wasn't really follow-up because there was nothing there to follow up. You know, as we were walking out, he said Listen, I'm sorry for that. I think what happened -- he sort of goosed (ph) up. He built up. There was some puffery to the email, perhaps to get the meeting, to make it happen, and you know, in the end, there was probably some bait and switch about what it was really supposed to be about. And so, you know, there is nothing there.

HANNITY: So she is saying that she had no information to provide. Do you remember what she suggested, that you were pressing her a little bit for information?

TRUMP JR.: Well, I imagine I did. I mean, I was probably pressing because the pretext of the meeting was, Hey, I have information about your opponent. It was this, you know, Hey, some DNC donors may have done something and Russia and they didn't pay taxes -- I was, like, What does this have to do with anything? You know, especially in light of everything that was out there, I was, like, This isn't ...

HANNITY: Did you ever have any contact with this woman again?

TRUMP JR.: No.

HANNITY: Did you ever have any contact with Goldstone again?

TRUMP JR.: Casual, Hey, how's it going? Emin's going to be in town performing, something like that. But ...

HANNITY: Did you ever see Emin again? Except ...

TRUMP JR.: I don't believe so, no.

HANNITY: The Doral concert...

TRUMP JR.: I don't think I've seen Emin since this transpired.

HANNITY: OK. So this is a hypothetical. At any point in your mind, did Don, Jr., have a siren saying, OK, they're talking -- again, I go back to the first email about Russia, Russian government, meeting with this person. You were going to talk on the phone. Did you ever think maybe this might not be ...

TRUMP JR.: Listen, I think -- like I said, in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently. Again, this is before the Russia mania. This is before they were building it up in the press. For me, this was opposition research. They had something, you know, maybe concrete evidence to all the stories I'd been hearing about, but were probably underreported for, you know, years; not just during the campaign.

So I think I wanted to hear it out. But really, it went nowhere and it was apparent that that wasn't what the meeting was actually about.

HANNITY: OK, let me -- let me ask a hypothetical. And I know (ph) hypotheticals -- maybe you've thought about it since and since this has now become Russia, collusion, Russia collusion and et cetera. Did you ever meet with any other person from Russia that you know?

TRUMP JR.: You know, I don't even know. I've probably met with other people from Russia...

HANNITY: I mean during the campaign.

TRUMP JR.: ...not in the context of actual -- a formalized meeting or anything like that because why would I? You know, in the grand scheme of things, how busy we were, it -- it was much more important to doing (ph) this. This was a courtesy to an acquaintance.

HANNITY: Let me play a montage. And these are Democrats attacking you today.

TRUMP JR.: Yes.

HANNITY: And give you a chance to respond to what they're saying and what the left is saying. I mean, they have taken it to the ultimate extreme. And I'll ask you about some perspective about some of my comments at the beginning of the show. Here's what they're saying.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: We now know that through intermediaries, the Russian government sought to approach the Trump campaign to see whether they would be interested in damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

We now know that the response that the president's son gave to the Russians was that he would love it if they would provide damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Rather than report this overture by the Russian government to provide damaging information to intervene in the presidential election in a way to help his father, neither the president's son nor the campaign reported this information to the FBI.

SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN, D-MD.: We get this email exchange today showing clear collaboration between the Russian government and Russian government agents and the Trump campaign at the highest levels, where the email is very clear that the Russian government is weighing in to help elect Donald Trump.

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-CALIF.: We need Donald Trump Jr., and other campaign associates to turn over any and all documents and electronic communications that investigators ask for. And we need public testimony under oath of Donald Trump, Jr., who has changed his story repeatedly.

SEN. TIM KAINE, D-VA.: We're now beyond obstruction of justice in terms of what's being investigated. This is moving into perjury, false statements and even potentially treason.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: Schumer's -- did you hand over any and all documents?

TRUMP JR.: Well, I will. I've said it publicly. I said it yesterday, more than happy to cooperate with everyone. I just want the truth to get out there. And that's part of why I released all the stuff today. I wanted to get it all out there.

HANNITY: But this isn't...

TRUMP JR.: They're trying drag out the story, Sean, in all fairness. You know, they have it. They want to drip a little bit today, drip a little bit then. So I was, like, Here it is. I'm more than happy to be transparent about it, and I'm more than happy to cooperate with everyone.

HANNITY: So as far as you know, as far as this incident is concerned, this is all of it?

TRUMP JR.: This is everything. This is everything.

HANNITY: Was anybody else at any point in the campaign said, Oh, I got information about Hillary, that you remember?

TRUMP JR.: No. No.

HANNITY: Let me go back to what Tim Kaine said -- well, if it is what you said, you're especially -- you know, we would want it released later in the summer. You think that's unusual for a campaign to want op research? And I'll get to the Ukrainian issue, which I think had been underreported, especially in light of this coverage. But...

TRUMP JR.: Well, like I said, I think we had more important things to worry about. I wasn't sure of the credibility of any of this stuff. At the time, I'm sitting there, Indiana had just probably happened, you know, I'm worried about hearing a contested convention, contested convention. So you know, we're going to fight. This is the first time we've ever done any of this. This is -- you know, I'm still way in the learning curve on all of this.

So it wasn't that urgent to me, if I'm saying, Hey, it can wait until the end of summer. But yes, I basically want to hear the information. I mean, that's what we do in business. If there's information out there, you want it, and then you make what you do with it.

If there was something that came from it that was shady, if it was a danger to national security, I would obviously bring it right to someone. But I didn't know what anything was. It turns out it was nothing, and therefore, there was nothing to be able to actually talk about.

HANNITY: The whole contact took how long? How long was the meeting?

TRUMP JR.: About 20 minutes or so.

HANNITY: About 20 minutes. And Jared left after 5 or 10?

TRUMP JR.: Yes.

HANNITY: Like she said? And Paul Manafort was on his...

TRUMP JR.: On his phone.

HANNITY: The whole time?

TRUMP JR.: Pretty much.

HANNITY: Pretty much.

TRUMP JR.: It -- it -- listen, like I said...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP JR.: ... pretty really apparent that this was not what we were in there talking about.

HANNITY: A lot of people are going to want to know this about your father. Did you tell your father anything about this?

TRUMP JR.: No. It was such a nothing. There was nothing to tell. I mean, I wouldn't have remembered it until you start scouring through the stuff. It was -- it was literally just a wasted 20 minutes, which was a shame.

HANNITY: All right. So, we're going to take a break. We'll come back. We'll have more Donald, Jr., -- Donald Trump, Jr., right after the break.

Liberals in the destroy Trump media once again have worked themselves into frenzy. They're frothing at the mouth. News (ph), Donald Trump, Jr., met with a Russian lawyer next (sic) summer. Donald Trump will react -- Donald Trump, Jr., will react next and much more straight ahead tonight on ""Hannity.""

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" So shortly after The New York Times broke the report about Donald Trump, Jr.'s, meeting with a Russian lawyer last year, well, the Russia-obsessed media in the country went on the attack. Let's take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)

MARK HALPERIN, MSNBC: Even you they accept his Sunday version -- accept his Sunday version, ask no questions, have no suspicions -- he's in a world of hurt.

RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC: The president's son, according to this new reporting, was informed, Hey, the Russian government has dirt on Hillary Clinton, and apparently, the response to that was...

ANA NAVARRO, CNN: He was admitting that he had met with this Russian lawyer for the purpose of receiving information against Hillary Clinton. I thought, My God, this kid was dropped on his head as a child. Could he possibly be admitting this?

JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC: I mean, how stupid of Don, Jr. I mean, I guess it runs in the family to go on Twitter when he is clearly in legal jeopardy.

JAKE TAPPER, CNN: This can't be dismissed as people out to get Donald J. Trump, Jr., or fake news. This is evidence of willingness to commit collusion.

(END VIDEO CLIPS)

HANNITY: And we continue with Donald Trump, Jr.

What's your reaction to that? They're saying you're colluding. It's a -- your reaction.

TRUMP.: Listen, I think politics is a dirty game. We've seen the sides that they take. We've seen the commentary they've had on my father. You know, I think it's a little bit ridiculous and overplayed. And I think people are getting that.

I think the media has really done themselves a disservice by picking sides so flagrantly. They've really driven people to actually have to think about it because it's just a tough game.

HANNITY: What about -- anyone on your team -- I guess you have a staff of people that work for you. Did anyone research the lawyer or anybody involved in this?

TRUMP JR.: Well, again...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP JR.: We didn't know who it was before the meeting.

HANNITY: You didn't know who the woman was?

TRUMP JR.: No, we didn't know who she was before the meeting. You know, apparently, she was a prosecutor in Moscow who hasn't done that since 2002. So you know, 14 years ago at the time of the meeting, she was a prosecutor.

And it was such a nothing, I literally wouldn't have remembered the meeting, especially when you think about it in the grand scheme...

HANNITY: Were you annoyed when you walked out of the meeting?

TRUMP JR.: What's that?

HANNITY: Were you annoyed based on...

TRUMP JR.: It was a waste of time. But again, you know, sometimes you do things differently for acquaintances and for friends.

HANNITY: Let me ask a hypothetical. And I hate hypothetical questions, but I think it's relevant in this case. If the meeting resulted in information that you felt in any way was illegal or compromising or collusion, to use the media's term...

TRUMP JR.: I said it earlier, 100 percent I would bring it to the proper authorities. There's nothing that I would do to ever endanger this country.

I think the reason we fought so hard during this campaign, whether it was my father and the work that he put into it, whether it was the rest of our family and the efforts that we put into it -- and you know those efforts well -- it's because we'd do anything for this country. So we're never going to put that in jeopardy, ever.

HANNITY: This, as far as you know, are all the emails that exist on this case. And you don't think there's any other one.

TRUMP JR.: I do not think there's anything else. We've scoured it thoroughly just to be sure. But there isn't anything else there.

HANNITY: All right. And there was no follow-up. I think this is important. No follow-up with any of them?

TRUMP JR.: No.

HANNITY: Never heard from the woman again.

TRUMP JR.: It was such a nothing, there was no reason to follow up. It was a waste of time.

HANNITY: All right. Did you learn about the adoption issue when you were there? Did that...

TRUMP JR.: Well, again, I think I gave them a little bit of time as a courtesy, so I probably heard whatever I heard in the room. But you know, it's a big issue for a lot of people, I guess. But this wasn't a campaign talking point. This wasn't something we were -- you know, this was not something I was going to worry about at that stage. I mean, we had a lot of bigger fish to fry. And that's what I was focused on.

HANNITY: When we come back, I want to address the media coverage -- the issue of the Ukrainian story that I brought up and whether you think there's a double standard and the treatment of your family by the media. We've got all the tape you'd ever want, and much more. We'll continue with, Don, Jr., on the other side of this break.

And when we come back, we'll ask him about the Trump family, how they feel about the daily attacks against their father and everybody else by the media.

Also tonight, we'll get a legal opinion. Jay Sekulow will weigh in, as well, as we continue.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's news headquarters, I'm Jackie Ibanez in New York.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell keeping senators in Washington for another three weeks. They were supposed to begin their recess July 31st. Earlier a group of Republicans called on the majority leader to shorten or cancel the August recess to work on health care, tax reform, and the rest of their campaign promises.

A federal judge halting the deportation of 1,400 Iraqi nationals to give courts a chance to review their cases. The government says they face deportation because they committed crimes here in the U.S. Many of the Iraqis who are Christians say they fear torture or death if returned to Iraq.

And a wildfire in northern California destroying dozens of homes, the flames consuming some nine square miles near Orville 60 miles north of Sacramento. At least 4,000 people are under evacuation orders tonight, but there are no reports of entry.

I'm Jackie Ibanez. Now back to ""Hannity.""

HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity"" as we continue our final moments with Donald Trump Jr.

At the beginning, look, this is an opinion show but I wanted to ask every question I could think of regarding this issue. I can't think of anymore, in all honesty. But I did bring up this issue of the Ukrainians working with the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign. I also talked about a lot of other issues, the V-15 group that Obama's operatives and taxpayer dollars went to defeat Bibi. If going after foreign countries' elections is so bad -- very little media coverage. Real crimes have been committed in this country. I would argue Hillary Clinton destroying emails, mishandling, destroying them. I would argue Hillary Clinton, the Uranium One deal and the 100 million plus dollars kicked back to her. Comey, we know it's classified information and we know a violation of the Records Act. Loretta Lynch's meeting with Bill Clinton on the tarmac, 125 leaks from the deep state in 126 days. The media that's watching this now never told the American people about the Ukrainian story except for ""Politico"" to their credit, and a few others, not many. What is your reaction to the double standard?

DONALD TRUMP JR, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SON: I think the double standard is upsetting. You see it every day. We tune in obviously, we were probably junkies before and now it's a lot harder to not take it personally, and you try to do it. And I would love to rant and rave about it, but candidly, right now, with everything that's going on, I think people see it. I think they are starting to get it.

And I think the mainstream media has probably done themselves a pretty big disservice by going so far, by going so extreme, by being so sensational. And I think it's pushing regular people away because they want to see what my father campaigned on. They want to see jobs. They want to see the numbers that he's putting up. The stock market keeps breaking hits. We have the all-time highest employment in the country in terms of overall numbers, all these things that he promised he would do, they're happening. They are actually happening. And that's not getting any coverage. And that's a real shame. That's a real disservice to the people of this country.

HANNITY: I agree with you. I think the forgotten men and women is something I talked about last night. Obviously Robert Mueller announced earlier tonight he's going to be looking into it. You said in a tweet you would fully cooperate with any investigation.

TRUMP JR.: Of course.

HANNITY: Completely.

TRUMP JR.: A hundred percent.

HANNITY: Turn over everything that they want and you feel you already have.

TRUMP JR.: Yes.

HANNITY: Yes. And you have nothing to hide. That means you will testify under oath, all of that?

TRUMP JR.: All of it.

HANNITY: Any other issue? Your sister was attacked. I could play montages of that. Joe Scarborough called your father a schmuck, a goon, a thug. That's NBC's coverage. You've got the severed head issue. You've got, you've been attacked. It seems like one by one, they try to pick off anyone around the president. Why do you think there's this reaction that is almost like there are so many groups so opposing your father, I've never seen it in all the years I've covered politics.

TRUMP JR.: I think we are just so far away from the political elite. Whether you are on one side or the other, you're still part of that group. They was never necessarily consequences for inaction, for doing things their way. So I think when you come from so far out. Look at the attacks on Ivanka. I was pretty vocal about that stuff this weekend. If she was anyone else's daughter, she would be a feminist icon, this incredible, brilliant, well-spoken woman. And they try to belittle her at every chance. It's really sad.

For me, as a family member, as her brother, her older brother, you do take it personally. It does make you want to fight back. That's perhaps what we are. We are fighters. And they don't take well to that either because most people they don't like being called on their stuff.

HANNITY: Last question. One of the things you said tonight maybe not be so Trump-ian I guess in a sense, although I do think your father and you are a lot alike, you said in retrospect. Explain that with a little bit more detail.

TRUMP JR.: I think I probably know more now. I think in the grand scheme of the hysteria that has been talked about over the last eight, nine, 10 months with Russia, things are probably different than they were 13 months ago when there were a couple people talking about it and they launched this notion, it's just a little bit different. In retrospect I know more now, but hindsight is always 20-20.

HANNITY: Don Jr., thanks for coming in.

TRUMP JR.: Thank you.

HANNITY: You answered every question I could think of.

When we come back we'll ge a legal perspective, Jay Sekulow with reaction to our exclusive interview with Donald Trump Jr. as we continue. And Terrence Williams speaks out. He gets the final minute tonight on ""Hannity.""

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP JR.: I'd been reading about scandals that people were probably underreporting for a long time. So maybe it was something that had to do with one of those things. This is her perhaps involvement with the Russia government. So, again, I didn't know there was at any credibility. I didn't know there was anything behind it. I can't vouch for the information. Someone sent me an email. I can't help what someone sends me. I read it. I responded accordingly. And if there was something interesting there, I think it's pretty common.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: Welcome back to ""Hannity."" That was Donald Trump Jr. from our exclusive interview just moments ago. Here with reaction is one of President Trump's attorneys, he's also the chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice Jay Sekulow. General reaction at first.

JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: Well, first, here's the first thing I'll say, and my friend, Governor Mike Huckabee said something very similar. So the media is going after Donald Trump Jr. for doing what? Releasing the full email chain unlike Secretary Clinton who deleted her emails. Let's put that in perspective, number one.

Number two, you look at it from a legal perspective here. There's no illegality in the meeting. The fact is nothing transpired. So what do we have here? I think Donald Trump Jr. said it correctly. There's a media frenzy on Russia right now. This has been going on for several months. But when you look to see what actually took place, a meeting took place. Nothing happened as a result of this 15 or 20 minute meeting. And at the end of the day, there's no illegality. So the people -- they want to create a media hysteria on this. But the reality I'm just trying to look at the lawyer and saying, OK, what statute of law has been violated? What code section has been violated here? And it doesn't exist.

HANNITY: What about what the Democrats are all saying -- between the media insanity and Democrats this proves collusion and oh, my gosh, again, I will ask you as an attorney. Tell me what laws -- and the second thing is, how is what I said in my opening monologue tonight about Ukraine, about the Russian dossier, Fusion GPS, about influencing the Israeli elections, didn't those things all happen, Jay Sekulow? And nobody talks about any of them. Isn't the Ukraine issue a real meeting, real information, real impact on the campaign?

SEKULOW: So what does the Ukraine issue show you? It shows you that in the heat of a political campaign groups come forward with opposition research and meetings take place. So of course that's getting completely overshadowed, was barely reported by I think it was ""Politico"" that did the report on that. But there you have DNC operatives meeting with Ukrainian officials, swapping information back and forth. So let's put that in perspective. So here what do you have? A meeting that takes place and nothing happens.

And then you raise the issue which I've been concerned about for a long time, and that was the whole issue of State Department funding going over to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars to a group that's running political campaigns against the Prime Minister in the state of Israel. Talking about engaging in electioneering in a foreign country, there you have it.

But again, it's not even fair to say double standard. But I want everybody to remember, Donald Trump Jr., what did he do today? He put forward the entire chain of emails. He didn't delete them as others have done in other campaigns, as we know.

HANNITY: I never run out of questions on this show. And I felt like I ran out of questions. I just don't know at that point what else he can do. He released the email, answered every question, explained what happened and didn't happen. It seems consistent with what the woman says, the lawyer from Russia, Jared says. I don't know what Manafort was saying. I don't know what there there is, and wouldn't every campaign, if they were told there's information, op research, isn't that what Hillary's campaign, the DNC did with Ukraine?

SEKULOW: Remember, let's put this into the perspective of what was going on. They were in the middle of a campaign that was in the heat of the campaign here. What happens? Someone comes forward with opposition research. Is anybody saying, by the way, why did the DNC have their operatives meeting with the Ukrainians and actually getting information? Why is that not one standard and this is another? But let's look at again what law was violated here? Some of the theories that some of the commentators have put forward are ridiculous. There was no illegality in that meeting. In the end, on top of that, there was no information that was obtained. So there you have it.

HANNITY: We will take a quick break. We'll come back. More with Jay Sekulow with reaction to our exclusive interview with Donald Trump Jr.

And you don't want to miss this later tonight --

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TERRENCE WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: There the Democrats go again. Trump colluded with Russia. The Russians hacked the election. No, y'all just lost the election fair and square.

(LAUGHTER)

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: All right, he gets the last word all week, conservative Twitter and social media sensation Terrence Williams. And we'll get his take on the Democrats obsession with Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP JR.: In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently. Again, this is before the Russian mania, this is before they were building it up in the press. For me this was opposition research. They had something, maybe concrete evidence to all the stories I had been hearing about but were probably underreported for years, not just during the campaign. So I think I wanted to hear it out. But really it went nowhere and it was apparent that that wasn't what the meeting with actually about.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: So it's being reported tonight -- Donald Trump, by the way, from our exclusive interview tonight. Jay Sekulow, who is with the American Center for Law and Justice, chief counsel, also a counsel for the president.

Here is what the amazing thing -- we've got Ukraine. We've got the Bibi Netanyahu, Obama tried to impact that election. You've got the MI6, the intelligence guy from Great Britain, his dossier. Who paid for that? And then we've got real crimes. For example, do you believe or have any doubt that Hillary Clinton committed crimes, mishandling and destroying classified, top secret special access program information?

SEKULOW: Look, we could start with the server that was held in the townhouse in Colorado. Then you go to what James Comey said when he saw the evident, that it was extreme carelessness, which, by the way, is the definition of gross negligence which is what the criminal statute has for mishandling.

Then let's talk about James Comey and add him to this. Here's a guy that leaks information, think about this, he leaks information based on conversations he had with the president of the United States, leaks them to go to a reporter through a friend of his at Columbia Law School for the sole purpose of doing what? Obtaining a special counsel which ends up getting appointed. So basically, look at this, Sean. The special counsel is appointed based on evidence that was illegally distributed. Think about that for a moment with the legitimacy of this entire process. And instead what we've got now is Donald Trump Jr. comes forward, releases all the emails, the emails chains, and the media is in a frenzy because he released the emails, unlike the opposition, who did not.

HANNITY: And over $100 million gets kicked back to the Clinton Foundation, and she's one of nine people that signed off on a waiver that allows 20 percent of America's uranium potentially to go to Vladimir Putin and Russia. Where I grew up, that's called bribery, pay to play, use whatever phrase you want. Do you doubt that was inappropriate and illegal?

SEKULOW: Let me tell you who would have never signed a deal like that for the United States. President Trump would have never authorized a deal like that, period.

HANNITY: Agreed with that. And then we have got other issues. Then we've got Loretta Lynch, the tarmac meeting, it's a matter, it's not an investigation.

SEKULOW: But look what she did. Look what Loretta Lynch did. She has this meeting with President Clinton while President Clinton's wife, the former secretary of state, Democratic nominee for president, is going to be interviewed that very weekend. She has this meeting with the president on the tarmac, right? Did she recuse herself from the investigation? No. She said she will abide by whatever the FBI decides but she did not formally recuse herself.

So think about this for a moment. You talk about a double standard at play here. This is the ultimate discussion or ultimate example of a double standard. But look, I think at the end of the day, when you look at all of the evidence, there is one thing that becomes clear, and that is no illegality in that meeting. So the media could talk about it, but show me the criminal statute that is actually met with that kind of situation.

TRUMP NEEDS THE WALL MORE THAN TAX CUTS

Other than the absolute direness of his opponent, it was probably the issue of a wall on the Mexican border more than anything else that made Donald Trump president.

And it will probably be that wall (or the lack of it), not taxes or ObamaCare or North Korea, that probably decides whether he can get re-elected.

First, understand that the wall is not in any way popular in the traditional sense – in fact, the wall is just about exactly as popular as Trump with the broad electorate, i.e. not very.

This week’s brand-new Fox News poll finds just 39 percent of voters favor the border barricade, just 2 points less than Trump’s new job-approval rating. But if we peel those numbers back just a bit, we see more than just an unpopular president pushing an unpopular initiative.

Almost half of the people who support the wall would also back Trump’s call for a government shutdown unless Congress provides adequate funds to start construction in earnest.

Think about that. That’s nearly one in five American voters who would rather the government go off the fiscal cliff at the end of next month than not start construction on Trump’s great wall.

These are quite likely the same voters who have stood by Trump through all of the tempests, both genuine and manufactured, that have beset him since he declared for office last summer. They may love the smackdown showmanship and the other parts of Trump’s personality-driven presidency, but it’s the wall that represents his first, most important contract with them.

Just as it was an, ahem, concrete version of Trump’s MAGA message for these voters, it remains the concrete proof that, despite all of the missteps, Trump is still delivering. They didn’t chant “Drop corporate taxes!” at the rallies.

Democrats are, of course, thrilled. This gives them the possibility of either a) running against a party next year that shut the government on itself or b) running against vulnerable Republicans with ads that say “Congresswoman Susie Creamcheese voted to take money away from drowning puppies to fund Donald Trump’s border wall…”

But as Trump’s 2016 victory demonstrated perfectly, the power of an intensely engaged minority is enormous in our political era.

Trump looks unlikely to ever be a popular politician in the sense of some of his predecessors. He is the most divisive national political figure in memory and the antipathy against him among nearly half the electorate seems fairly well set.

Moreover, he will certainly have significant primary opposition in his own party. The fact that his own vice president is significantly more popular than Trump – not just in general but among Republicans – is a good refection of the discontentment among conservatives.

For Trump to survive the primaries and stand a fighting chance in the fall of 2020 he will need his noisy minority not just with him, but ready to fight again. And if the builder they elected doesn’t build a wall, they won’t be ready to rumble.

Trump seems to understand that enough to have made the shutdown treat over the wall. But that puts him at odds with many, if not most, of his fellow Republicans in Congress. Once again, Trump and his party’s interests diverge.

And that’s why there’s a real chance of a shutdown, a shutdown, by the way, that would jeopardize other GOP priorities like tax cuts and patching ObamaCare for next year.

TIME OUT: REVOLUTIONARY ROGUE

History: “Samuel Mason, a Patriot captain in command of Fort Henry on the Ohio frontier [in present-day Wheeling, W.Va.], survives a devastating Indian attack on this day in 1777. ... They ambushed the party, killing all but Mason. … Following the end of the war, though, he fell on hard times. … By the early 1800s, Mason had become one of the most notorious desperados on the American frontier, a precursor to Jesse James… Determined to apprehend Mason, the Americans upped the reward for his capture, dead or alive. The reward money soon proved too tempting for two members of Mason’s gang; in July 1803 they killed Mason, cut off his head and brought it into the Mississippi territorial offices to prove that they had earned the reward. The men were soon identified as members of Mason’s gang, however, and they were arrested and hanged.”

TRUMP FACES TOUGH DECISION ON DREAMERS

AP: “With a deadline looming, President Donald Trump remains torn over the fate of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants who were brought into the country illegally as children — a decision that will draw fury no matter what he decides. Trump railed against the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program during his campaign, slamming it as illegal ‘amnesty.’ But he changed his tune after the election, calling DACA one of the most difficult issues he’s grappled with. The program has given nearly 800,000 people a reprieve from deportations. It has also provided the ability to work legally in the U.S. in the form of two-year, renewable work permits — permits the Trump administration has continued to grant as the president has mulled the issue. On Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said DACA was still the subject of ‘a very lengthy review’ process. ‘It’s something that’s still being discussed and a final decision hasn’t been made,’ she said.”

He could face major backlash from staff, CEOs if he ends it - Axios: “President Trump could trigger a furious response from corporations and some members of his own staff if he green-lights a plan under consideration at the White House to end DACA…some top CEOs, including leaders in tech and retail, plan to be tough and vocal if Trump ends the policy. But they're keeping quiet for now because they fear antagonizing him on a question that could have massive implications for their workforces. … Trump has faced an escalating revolt from CEOs — starting with the Muslim ban, increasing with his climate-change decision, and peaking with his handling of Charlottesville. Scores of high profile CEOs would pummel him publicly if he clears the way for mass deportation of kids.”



House GOP looks at disaster funds to finance wall - AP:

“President Donald Trump is promising billions to help Texas rebuild from Harvey-caused epic flooding, but his Republican allies in the House are looking at cutting almost $1 billion from disaster accounts to help finance the president’s border wall. The pending reduction to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief account is part of a massive spending bill that the House is scheduled to consider next week when lawmakers return from their August recess. The $876 million cut, which is included in the 1,305-page measure’s homeland security section, pays for roughly half the cost of Trump’s down payment on the U.S.-Mexico border wall that the president repeatedly promised Mexico would finance. … There’s only $2.3 billion remaining in federal disaster coffers. The disaster relief cut was proposed well before Harvey and the politically bad optics are sure to lead lawmakers to do an about face, though that would create a money crunch in homeland security accounts.”



Meanwhile, a Federal judge blocked Texas sanctuary city ban - Politico: “A federal judge in Texas blocked the bulk of the state’s immigration law targeting sanctuary cities on Wednesday, a victory for civil rights groups and Democratic-led city governments that oppose the measure. The order came two days before a Sept. 1 deadline to implement the new law, which seeks to ensure local police cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. U.S. District Court Judge Orlando Garcia issued a preliminary injunction against most provisions of the measure, known as SB 4. The law authorizes local police to ask about immigration status during routine stops, and threatens police chiefs with misdemeanor charges and fines if they fail to enforce federal immigration laws.”

MUELLER TEAM MET WITH RUSSIAN LOBBYIST

AP: “A grand jury used by Special Counsel Robert Mueller has heard secret testimony from a Russian-American lobbyist who attended a June 2016 meeting with President Donald Trump’s eldest son, The Associated Press has learned. A person familiar with the matter confirmed to the AP that Rinat Akhmetshin had appeared before Mueller’s grand jury in recent weeks. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the secret proceedings. The revelation is the clearest indication yet that Mueller and his team of investigators view the meeting, which came weeks after Trump had secured the Republican presidential nomination, as a relevant inquiry point in their broader probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The meeting included Donald Trump Jr.; the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. Emails released by Trump Jr. show he took the meeting expecting that he would be receiving damaging information about Hillary Clinton as part of what was described to him as a Russian government effort to aid the Trump campaign.”



Mueller working with New York A.G. to investigate Manafort - Politico: “Special counsel Robert Mueller’s team is working with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on its investigation into Paul Manafort and his financial transactions, according to several people familiar with the matter. The cooperation is the latest indication that the federal probe into President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman is intensifying. It also could potentially provide Mueller with additional leverage to get Manafort to cooperate in the larger investigation into Trump’s campaign, as Trump does not have pardon power over state crimes.”

Trump offered Grassley ethanol subsidy promise ahead of hearing - WaPo: “President Trump called the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee to talk about one of his most important parochial issues — ethanol — shortly before the committee is slated to interview his son in its ongoing Russia probe. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley’s panel will be hosting Trump’s son next month for an interview behind closed doors in its ongoing Russia probe… On Wednesday morning, Grassley announced via Twitter that the president had called him to discuss not Russia, but ethanol, proudly announcing that ‘he assured me he’s pro ethanol’ and that Grassley was free to tell the people of Iowa ‘he’s standing by his campaign PROMISE.’”

BIDEN TO TEST THE 2020 WATERS WITH A NEW BOOK

The Hill: “Former Vice President Joe Biden will release a new book this fall that could also serve as a test for whether the country is interested in seeing him run for president. Longtime advisers to Biden see his memoir, ‘Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship and Purpose,’ as the ultimate test for whether he’ll wade into a potentially crowded 2020 field. ‘It's a chance to step out on his own terms with a character reinforcing narrative that reintroduces himself to America as more than a vice president,’ said one former senior aide. His book tour will be a vital test. Can he generate enthusiasm and crowds and subtly market his character, conviction, values and vision to a national audience? ‘It's a great soft launch for a potential campaign,’ the confidant said. Biden’s book is due to be published on Nov. 14, just more than a year after Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election to Donald Trump.”

Harris, Sanders make new tag team - Politico: “California’s junior senator, Kamala Harris, on Wednesday departed from the position held by the state’s senior senator, Dianne Feinstein, and announced her intention to co-sponsor Senator Bernie Sanders’ ‘Medicare for All’ bill. To the delight of a hometown crowd at a packed town hall meeting Wednesday in Oakland — where she was raised — Harris announced for the first time that she intended to co-sponsor ‘Medicare for All,’ the single-payer health care bill which has the strong support of progressives and groups including National Nurses United, saying it was ‘the right thing to do.’”

THE JUDGE’S RULING: HARD POWER

Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano looks at the restoration of the federal government providing military hardware to local police: “Moreover, the strings attached to this federal hardware giveaway do not require congressional or even local government approval. They require only acceptance by the police and regular local use of the military equipment.” More here.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Sir, One factor you seem to have overlooked in the defeat of Bush 1 and Clinton losing Congress was their actions on gun control. Bush 1 ran on a strict promise there would be no new gun laws during his administration, and then imposed the first ‘assault weapons ban’ by executive order. We won’t get into his theatrics with the investigation into ATF actions. A lot of us who worked for his election washed our hands of him after he proved to be a spineless liar. As for Clinton, his ‘Crime Bill’ ended the careers of a lot of very senior ‘untouchable’ democrats. The legislation passed afterwards to stop such citizen action from happening again (professional political protection act) speaks strongly to that. Do you think the defeat of Speaker [Tom Foley was over taxes? People get angry over taxes, but they go psycho when rights they see as fundamental are trampled.” – Michael North, Bryan, Ohio



[Ed. note: Goodness, Mr. North! I said the tax increase “helped deliver” Bush’s 1992 loss. Gun control was certainly part of it, as was his support for the Clean Air Act, among other things. And the assault weapons ban was certainly a major factor in Clinton’s 1994 midterm shellacking. But I would submit that nothing hurt Foley in his own loss more than his opposition to term limits. Voters of Washington had approved a state constitutional amendment imposing them and Foley sued to overturn the restriction. It’s never good to be running for re-election when you’re the lead plaintiff in the case of “the people of the state of Washington.”]



“Just read your essay about tax reform. Very educational and it had me thinking. According to the Constitution, all tax legislation is required to start in the House. The House has relegated taxes to the Ways and Means Committee. What committee, some may ask? Yes, the Ways and Means Committee. One of the quietist committees on Capitol Hill. Just what have they been doing? I rarely, if ever, here from them. Back in the ‘80s they were heard from a lot. Even in the ‘90s. Since the beginning of this century, not so much. Just what has that committee been doing when everyone from both parties know that the country needs serious tax reform.” – Onnie Duvall, Cambridge, Md.



[Ed. note: It would seem to me to be a tautology: less big tax legislation means that we will hear less from the tax writing legislation. But I would submit that it was still potent enough to serve as a stepping stone for current House Speaker Paul Ryan.]

WBAL: “Two men who police said robbed a pub in Woodlawn [Md.] may not have expected it to be full of police officers. Baltimore County police have two suspects in custody who they said robbed a pub Tuesday night at gunpoint. The armed suspects walked in to Monaghan’s Pub a little before 5:30 p.m. Tuesday. It turns out that the pub was hosting a police officer’s retirement party with dozens of off-duty officers in attendance. … Investigators said two men entered the take-out portion of the restaurant and held an employee up at gunpoint. ‘At that time, the person who had been behind the counter knew that there was a retirement party for a police officer happening, so they went into the other portion and alerted the officers to the fact that they had just been involved in an armed robbery,’ [Baltimore County police Officer Jennifer Peach] said.”

Follow Her On Twitter At']",FOX News,"Senate Democrats used a parliamentary maneuver Wednesday to cut short a high-profile hearing, where a key witness was set to testify on Russia's misdeeds and also raise fresh allegations against the company behind the infamous anti-Trump dossier.

Bill Browder, the CEO and co-founder of Hermitage Capital, was set to tell the Senate Judiciary Committee that the co-founder of the firm Fusion GPS was hired to conduct a ""smear campaign"" against him. Further, he planned to testify the campaign was orchestrated by Natalia Veselnitskaya -- the Russian attorney who sought the highly scrutinized Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort in June 2016.

Browder released written testimony ahead of the hearing but his public remarks were delayed when Democrats invoked the ""two-hour rule"" to protest Republican efforts to repeal ObamaCare. The seldom-used rule bars committees from meeting more than two hours after the full Senate begins a session.

“Veselnitskaya, through Baker Hostetler, hired Glenn Simpson of the firm Fusion GPS to conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of congressional hearings on the Global Magnitsy Act.” — Bill Browder, in prepared statement to Senate committee

“I don’t know if the minority is intentionally trying to block testimony that may be critical of a firm behind the unverified Trump dossier, but I’ll bet two bits that had Paul Manafort or Donald Trump, Jr. appeared at today’s hearing, it would not have been prematurely shut down,"" Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a statement. ""The Democrat leadership is playing politics, plain and simple.""

Browder now is expected to testify Thursday, but his statement makes clear that he will have plenty to say about Fusion GPS, the shadowy intel company founded by a pair of former Wall Street Journal reporters, including Glenn Simpson.

“Veselnitskaya, through Baker Hostetler, hired Glenn Simpson of the firm Fusion GPS to conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of congressional hearings on the Global Magnitsky Act,” Browder wrote in his prepared testimony, adding that the firm helped to organize a Washington D.C.-based premiere of a “fake documentary” about Magnitsky and himself.

“While they were conducting these operations in Washington D.C., at no time did they indicate that they were acting on behalf of Russian government interests, nor did they file disclosures under the Foreign Agent Registration Act,” Browder’s prepared testimony said.

Browder added: “This was one of the best examples of Putin’s propaganda.”

Browder hired the late Sergei Magnitsky to uncover details of massive financial fraud in Russia involving corrupt Russian government officials. Magnitsky was imprisoned and ultimately beaten to death by Russian officers in Moscow. In the wake of his death, the U.S. passed a law named for him that brought sanctions against Russian oligarchs suspected of money laundering.

Grassley noted that he had been asking about the Russians working with Fusion GPS since March 2017. He cited the widely discredited dossier compiled about Trump that circulated among Democratic operatives and the media during the latter stages of the 2016 presidential campaign.

“Mr. Simpson’s company, Fusion GPS, is the same firm that oversaw the creation of the unverified Trump Dossier,” Grassley said in his opening statement. “It is vital for the Committee to fully understand Fusion’s failure to register under FARA and its role in the creating and spreading of the dossier.”

Grassley acknowledged that around the same time Fusion helped to “orchestrate a propaganda campaign” to repeal the Magnitsky Act, Fusion “appears to have been involved in the creation of the dirty Trump Dossier.”

“There are public reports that the FBI used the dossier to kickstart its Russia investigation—Did the FBI know that Fusion pitched Russian propaganda for another client as it pushed the Trump dossier?” Grassley asked in his opening statement, delivered before the hearing was cut short.

Grassley questioned Veselnitskaya’s meeting at Trump Tower.

“Was it just a clumsy bait-and-switch effort in their unregistered propaganda and influence campaign? They offered dirt on the opponent to get the meeting and then made their pitch against the Magnitsky Act?” Grassley asked. “Or was it an offer of collusion? Or maybe both?”

Grassley and Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called for the president’s eldest son to testify, along with Manafort, and Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS in the committee’s oversight hearing on FARA. All three witnesses have since reached arrangements to interview with the committee, for now, in private.

“There was no mystery of who Natalia Veselnitskaya was. A simple Google search would have shown that she was the main in house lawyer for a high level Russian government official whose son was accused by the US DOJ of money laundering from the Magnitsky case in the US,” Browder told Fox News before his appearance before the committee. “Either the people in that meeting didn't do any due diligence in advance or someone made an error in judgement agreeing to meet with her in the first place.”

But with regard to Fusion GPS, Browder told Fox News that he didn’t know what else Simpson was involved with, but that the group did not register under FARA.

“Natalia engaged Glenn Simpson and Fusion GPS in order to run an anti-Magnitsky Act smear campaign in Washington D.C. which was funded by sources connected to the Russian government,” Browder told Fox News.

Though he did not testify before the committee Wednesday, Thor Halvorssen, a human rights advocate with the Human Rights Foundation, submitted statements for the record to the committee in regards to his experience with Fusion GPS.

“It’s the sort of thing they specialize in—mainstreaming false smears, allegations that are so salacious and over the top that people assume they must be true,” Halvorssen told Fox News, noting the crude dossier about the president. “They did this with Browder, they did this with two other whistleblowers and they did this with me –they are outrageous accusations where innocence just isn’t enough.”

Halvorssen said public exposure is key to combatting Fusion GPS, which he said has been active in international smear campaigns.

in his written statement, Halvorssen told the committee that Fusion GPS targeted him and several others because of their criticism of Derwick Associates, a Venezuelan energy company that was reportedly being investigated for an alleged multi-billion dollar bribe.

“I think it’s clear that this is not the case of a company that forgot to register, or didn’t know that they had to register,” Halvorssen told Fox News. “Fusion GPS purposely, and quite deliberately, chose not to register so that their activity would fly under the radar, leading people to see the result of their work as organic and real, pushing a noble vision of truth, instead of what it actually is –smear campaigns in return for large enough retainers.”'

But in its statement given to Fox News earlier this month, Fusion said it had nothing to do with the Trump Jr. meeting.

“Fusion GPS learned about this meeting from news reports and had no prior knowledge of it. Any claim that Fusion GPS arranged or facilitated this meeting in any way is absolutely false,” the statement read."

AP Stylebook Instructs Writers Not to Use Words Like 'Pro-Life,' 'Refugee' & 'Terrorist'

Former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer reacted to the newest reporting on Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer last June.

Earlier today, Trump Jr. released an email chain in which he set up the meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya after being told of incriminating information on Hillary Clinton.

Article continues below

The emails - purported to be between Trump Jr. and publicist Rob Goldstone - described Veselnitskaya as a ""Russian government attorney.""

Trump Jr. wrote back at one point, ""if it's what you say I love it"" on possibly obtaining damaging information that would help the Trump campaign.

Fleischer said on ""Outnumbered"" today that accepting the meeting appears to be ""bad judgment"" by Trump, rather than a crime or evidence of collusion.

""It certainly seems to me to be opposition research,"" he explained, adding this is not evidence of earlier allegations that the Trump team worked with Russia on the stolen DNC emails.

He said the White House has badly managed the matter, since there is a continuous 'drip, drip"" of new reports on contacts between the Trump team and Russia.

Fleischer, a new Fox News contributor, said seasoned political professionals would probably have known to ignore the offer, but the Trump campaign may have been ignorant.

""You just don't cross certain lines. ... Yes, you want opposition [research] on your opponent, but not the from the Russian government,"" he said.

Meghan McCain emphasized that the Trump administration will be dogged by a line in the email which described the information as ""high-level and sensitive"" and a part of the Russian government's support of Trump.

She said former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort should be blamed for this situation, calling him ""incompetent"" and ""one of the worst people who work in politics.""

McCain said a past statement by Vice President Mike Pence, in which he denied contacts between the Trump team and Russians, ""is now a lie.""

""How they have let this spin so completely out of control is beyond my comprehension,"" she concluded.

“If this isn't treasonous, I'm not sure what is,” Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Seth Moulton tweeted Tuesday after Trump Jr. released emails detailing plans for his meeting with a Russian lawyer purported to have dirt on Hillary Clinton.

The president’s son says no such information was exchanged at the time. But the new emails cast the meeting as connected to Russian government efforts to boost then-candidate Donald Trump, leading to harsh accusations from Democrats.

During Tuesday’s press briefing, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about words like “obstruction of justice,” “perjury” and “treason” being used against the Trump team.

“I think those new words are ridiculous,” Sanders said.

DONALD TRUMP JR. RELEASES EMAIL CHAIN ON RUSSIA MEETING

The emails in question pertained to the lead-up to a June 9, 2016 meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya after an acquaintance claimed the contact had damaging information on Clinton.

The emails were with Rob Goldstone, who arranged the meeting. Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner also attended.

Asked about the Trump Jr. story on Tuesday, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee, told a gaggle of reporters on Capitol Hill he believed the investigation into Russia’s attempted interference in the election could extend to treasonous behavior at home.

""We're now beyond obstruction of justice in terms of what's being investigated,” Kaine said. “This is moving into perjury, false statements and even potentially treason.""

California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell on Tuesday accused Trump Jr. of a willingness to commit betrayal against the United States by accepting the meeting. “Trump Jr. was willing to betray US to cheat for his Dad's campaign,” the Democrat said.

Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, a reliable Trump critic, said in a statement that Trump’s campaign worked “to subvert America’s democracy” by colluding with Russia.

“These emails show there is no longer a question of whether this campaign sought to collude with a hostile foreign power to subvert America’s democracy,” Wyden said.

The invocation of “treason” by Democrats was mocked online, including by some on the left. “Running around screaming TREASON day after day is definitely conducive to a healthy, rational, and constructive political environment,” journalist Michael Tracey of the liberal The Young Turks tweeted.

Trump Jr. said in a statement Tuesday he released the emails in the interest of transparency.

He has downplayed the significance of the meeting all along and said in his latest statement that he presumed the information the contact had was ""Political Opposition Research.""

""I first wanted to just have a phone call but when they didn’t work out, they said the woman would be in New York and asked if I would meet. I decided to take the meeting,"" he explained.

Trump Jr. also said the woman ""was not a government official"" and ""had no information to provide.""

He added, ""To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue."""

Follow Her On Twitter At']",FOX News,"The firm behind the infamous anti-Trump dossier was working at ""the same time"" on behalf of a Vladimir Putin-connected family to campaign against a U.S. sanctions law, a key witness in a Senate probe claims.

Bill Browder, CEO of Hermitage Capital, first spoke publicly about his allegations against the firm, Fusion GPS, and its co-founder Glenn Simpson at a Senate hearing last month.

But in a follow-up letter sent this month to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Browder revealed more details about the Russian figures who allegedly were working with Fusion -- and the timeline of those efforts.

Notably, he said the dossier and a separate campaign to repeal Magnitsky Act sanctions opposed by the Kremlin were undertaken at the same time. The Magnitsky Act was passed in 2012 to punish a handful of Russian officials in the wake of whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky's death in prison. It bars those officials from accessing the U.S. banking system.

""Yes,"" Browder answered, when asked whether Fusion took money from Russia while working on the dossier. ""Based on the timing of Fusion GPS’ work on the anti-Magnitsky campaign, as it was undertaken at the same time that Fusion GPS was also working for an unknown client on the Trump dossier.""

The White House has drawn attention to Browder's prior claims about Fusion's ties to Russia to undermine ""collusion"" claims by asserting Moscow was actually working against him in the 2016 race.

Browder is not claiming that Russia paid for the dossier containing salacious allegations against the now-U.S. president. He said he does not know who paid Fusion for that work.

However, he was blunt in alleging the dossier was being compiled at the ""same time"" the company was doing work for Russia on the anti-sanctions push.

FIRM BEHIND ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER ALSO WORKED FOR RUSSIA, SENATE WITNESS SAYS

Further, he outlined his account of how the company's services were contracted.

“Fusion GPS was paid by the Katsyv family which is headed by a high-ranking Russian official named Pyotr Katsyv,” Browder wrote.

Pyotr Katsyv, whom Browder called a ""senior member of the Putin regime,"" is vice president of ""Russian Railways"" -- a transportation company in which the Russian government is ""sole shareholder,"" according to Browder.

Katsyv also held top government positions in the Moscow region. In his letter, Browder said the Russian government works through ""proxies"" like the Katsyv family.

“When the Putin regime is not acting through direct channels, they make payments to their agents through ‘dependent oligarchs.’ The Katsyv family is a case in point. ... One of the main benefits to Putin was to be able to call on people like Mr. Katsyv to undertake important projects for him,"" Browder wrote.

""... I believe Putin effectively deputized the Katsyv family to wage a full-scale war to challenge the Magnitsky Act in the U.S. with the objective of repealing it and stalling the passing of the Global Magnitsky Act.""

Browder alleged that the Katsyv family hired Simpson and Fusion GPS, along with other individuals and companies in their anti-Magnitsky Act campaign.

Browder testified last month that Fusion GPS was hired to conduct a “smear campaign” against him orchestrated by Natalia Veselnitskaya—the Russian attorney who sought the highly scrutinized Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort in June 2016. The meeting was billed to the Trump campaign as one to discuss Russian adoption and potentially get dirt on Clinton, but Browder testified that adoption was “code” for talking about the Magnitsky Act.

At the time of that meeting, Veselnitskaya was working for a Cyprus-based real estate holdings company called Prevezon, run by the son of Pyotr Katsyv, Denis Katsyv.

Browder wrote that Prevezon's law firm, Baker Hostetler, formally hired Fusion GPS.

Prevezon at the time was caught up in a Justice Department money-laundering case. According to the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, the DOJ froze millions in assets that belonged to Prevezon. The attorney's office told Fox News that Prevezon had received nearly $2 million from the massive fraud scheme Magnitsky exposed.

The attorney who represented Denis Katsyv in the Prevezon case, which was settled in May, told Fox News there were “no dealings” with Fusion GPS during that case.

Baker Hostetler did not respond to a request for comment.

Fusion GPS has acknowledged working on the Prevezon case but stressed that the Trump dossier was a separate project.

TRUMP DOSSIER FIGURE QUESTIONED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS ON CAPITOL HILL

Simpson met with the staff of the Judiciary Committee behind closed doors for hours on Tuesday on Capitol Hill as part of their investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with the Trump campaign in the 2016 election—specifically regarding the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA.)

“Mr. Simpson told Congress the truth and cleared the record on many matters of interest to congressional investigators,” Simpson's lawyer, Josh Levy, said in a statement to Fox News. Levy said that Simpson kept the identities of Fusion GPS’ clients confidential.

“When those clients want Fusion GPS to keep their identities confidential, Fusion GPS honors that commitment without exception—just as law firms and businesses do all over the country,” he said.

MYSTERY SOLVED? TIMELINE SHOWS HOW RUSSIAN LAWYER GOT INTO US FOR TRUMP JR. MEETING

Browder had hired Magnitsky at his firm to uncover details of financial fraud in Russia involving corrupt Russian government officials. Magnitsky was imprisoned and ultimately beaten to death allegedly by Russian officers in Moscow.

“Fusion GPS was reaching out to journalists in order to generate press coverage for use in the anti-Magnitsky campaign,” Browder wrote. “Fusion GPS was paid for their work by the family of a senior Russian government official (the Katsyv family), who coordinated their activities with other members of the Putin regime.”

The Katsyv family could not be reached for comment.

""This investigation into Mr. Simpson began as a desperate attempt by the Trump campaign and its allies to smear Fusion GPS because of its reported connection to the Trump dossier,"" Levy said. ""A special counsel and three congressional committees are investigating ties between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. Fusion GPS is proud of the work it has conducted and stands by it."""

Follow Her On Twitter']",FOX News,"All it took was a Russian pop star and his publicist to reignite questions about whether President Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the White House.

Donald Trump Jr., the president’s oldest son, met with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 who supposedly had damaging information about Hillary Clinton, Trump’s political opponent at the time.

Trump Jr. said that he met with the lawyer as he thought she had “political opposition research” about Clinton.

According to emails published by Trump Jr. about the meeting, that intelligence included “some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia.”

The information is “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,"" according to the emails.

Here are the key players involved with that controversial meeting.

The president’s son

Trump Jr., 39, does not have a position in his father’s administration. However, he did serve as a top advisor to Trump’s presidential campaign.

DONALD TRUMP JR. RELEASES ‘ENTIRE EMAIL CHAIN’ REGARDING RUSSIAN MEETING

Trump Jr. is the president’s oldest son who eventually rose to the position of executive vice president of the Trump Organization after spending some time bartending and hunting in Colorado. Trump Jr. also appeared as a boardroom advisor on his father’s former reality show “The Apprentice.”

After Trump won the election, he left his business empire in a trust to be controlled by Trump Jr., his brother Eric and “other executives.”

Now, Trump Jr. oversees the commercial licensing and most of the international business aspects of the Trump Organization, according to a March New York Times profile.

Married to Vanessa Haydon since 2005, Trump Jr. has five children.

The pop star

Through the Miss Universe pageant – which Trump used to own – the Trumps met father and son duo, Aras and Emin Agalarov. Aras is a Russian developer, and Emin is a Russian pop star.

The pageant was held in Moscow in 2013, and during that trip, Trump spent time with Emin, appearing in a music video with him and several contestants in the pageant.

DONALD TRUMP JR.’S MEETING WITH RUSSIAN LAWYER: WHAT TO KNOW

Emin, 37, asked for Trump Jr. to meet with a lawyer in June 2016, according to emails published by the president’s son.

“Emin and his father have a very highly respected company in Moscow,” Trump Jr. said in a statement. “The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was Political Opposition Research.”

As a singer, Emin is a “household name in Russia where he’s sold in excess of 1 million albums and regularly sells out shows to tens of thousands of fans,” according to a biography on his website.

“Emin is positioned to do what no Russian male singer has ever done before – find crossover success in Western Europe and the U.S.,” his website boasts.

But aside from music, Emin – who was born in Azerbaijan – is involved with the family business, the Crocus Group, where he is the first vice president. The Crocus Group bills itself as “one of the leading development companies in Russia.”

He posted an Instagram photo of himself Tuesday evening with the caption ""finally sunshine"" in English and ""what news"" in Russian.

RUSSIAN LAWYER WHO MET WITH DONALD TRUMP JR. DENIES KREMLIN CONNECTIONS

Aras, 61, had hoped to partner with Trump on a hotel project in Moscow and tried to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin during the Miss Universe contest. He also reportedly paid Trump between $14 and $20 million to hold the pageant in Moscow.

Aras is often referred to as the “Donald Trump of Russia,” according to the Atlantic.

The publicist

Rob Goldstone, a British music publicist, facilitated the meeting between Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who was supposed to share the information on Clinton.

“The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary [Clinton] and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,” a man identified as Goldstone said in an email published by Trump Jr.

“This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump – helped along by Aras and Emin,” he added.

Goldstone is also a former tabloid journalist, according to his biography on the website for his public relations firm, Oui 2.

He accompanied former pop artist Michael Jackson to Australia for a tour in 1999 and represented “almost every major international artist touring Australia,” including Cyndi Lauper, Julio Iglesias, James Taylor, U2, BB King and Tracy Chapman, according to his website.

DONALD TRUMP JR. EXPLAINS MEETING WITH RUSSIAN LAWYER

The Guardian reported that Goldstone posted dozens of Instagram photos detailing his trips to Russia and called Moscow his second home. His Instagram account is now set to private.

Goldstone also supported Trump’s presidential campaign and wore a “Make America Great Again” hat in a photo, according to The Guardian.

The lawyer

It was Natalia Veselnitskaya who was supposed to have the damning information about Clinton.

But instead, Trump Jr. said, she only wanted to talk about a Russian adoption program and the Magnitsky Act, a bill passed in 2012 that allows the U.S. to impose sanctions on Russians for human rights violations.

In the emails published by Trump Jr., Veselnitskaya was referred to as the “Russian government attorney.” But Trump Jr. has maintained that she “was not a government official.”

Veselnitskaya has advocated for the repeal of the Magnitsky Act and has worked closely with one of her clients, Denis Katsyv, on the issue. Katsyv is the son of a senior Russian government official, Pyotr Katsyv, and the owner of a real estate company, according to the Washington Post.

Katsyv has advocated overturning the ban on Russian adoptions, which can only be overturned if the Magnitsky Act is repealed, according to the Post.

Veselnitskaya has denied giving Trump Jr. any information about Clinton.

The others

Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort were also in attendance at the meeting.

Manafort, 68, is under investigation by multiple agencies regarding his business dealings in Ukraine. He also reportedly contacted Russian officials multiple times during the presidential campaign.

He registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent in June.

Kushner is also under an investigation by the special counsel appointed to look into Russia’s involvement in the election. Investigators are interested in meetings Kushner had with Russian officials in December 2016.

Kushner, 36, is married to Trump’s daughter, Ivanka. He serves as a senior advisor to the president and has been tasked with brokering peace in the Middle East."

Bush Administration.']",FOX News,"Ukraine is the central battleground between the rapidly fraying West and the brutally ascendant East. As NATO bickers over defense contributions by member states, Article 5 commitments and its renegade member Turkey, Russia is taking concerted action to secure its borders, expand its influence and weaken the bedrock alliance that has kept the peace in Europe for the past 60 years.

Ukraine lies at ground zero in this clash of civilizations between the rule of law and the power of the sword. Its moves to join the EU prompted Russian troops to seize the eastern third of the country. Despite U.S. and European sanctions, Ukraine remains a divided and war-torn state on NATO’s eastern flank.

Curing the cancer of corruption will require radical surgery and The Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act might be one of the options to punish corrupted foreign officials.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s July 7th appointment of Ambassador Kurt Volker as Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations is a necessary but insufficient step in the right direction. Implementing the Minsk Agreements, which provide a blueprint for a political settlement, may reduce the violence but it will not cure the cancer that is steadily destroying Ukraine and doing more harm to the integrity of the state than Russian-backed aggression.

Ukraine is 130th out of 168 countries ranked by Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index 2015. It is worse than Russia (119) in terms of corruption. According to the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC), Ukrainians cite corruption as a more urgent problem than the war against pro-Russian rebels – by a margine of two-to-one. Another survey by the European Business Association and Dragon Capital, Ukraine’s leading private equity firm, found that “Foreign investors believe that the biggest obstacles for investment in Ukraine are widespread corruption (average score – 8.5 points out of 10 possible) and lack of trust in the judiciary (7.5 points).”

Most of the pre-war investment in Ukraine was actually re-invested Ukrainian and Russian capital, which means that key factors that keep genuine FDI away from Ukraine existed before the onset of the conflict. These obstacles still need to be addressed. As the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development underlines, “While the political and security situation has deteriorated in recent years, the problems are long-term and have to do with poor business environment, weak institutions, and widespread corruption.”



Institutional rot is at the core of Ukraine’s problem. The officials charged with enforcing Ukraine’s anti-corruption efforts are themselves compromised. Ukraine’s Prime Minister recognized this issue when he admitted last year that, “The weakest link in our fight against corruption are the Ukrainian courts.” Despite an initiative that requires judges and other public sector workers to detail their wealth in an online database, judges continue to drive Porsches and receive large sums of cash to influence judicial decisions. One-third (24 of 68) of the criminal cases sent by the National Anti-corruption Agency of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO) to courts remain stalled for over one year.



The senior leadership of Ukraine’s Anti-Corruption Action Center, which has received significant funding support from the U.S. government, has profited from sweetheart deals and kickbacks. Its Director, Vitaly Shabunin, earns $34,000 according to his tax filing. In 2010, he bought an apartment for $60,000. In 2014, he acquired land near Kiev for $20,000. In 2016, he sold his apartment for $34,000 and built a house for $83,000. All properties are registered in his wife’s name and there are no mortgages on the properties.



Politically motivated state-sponsored gangsterism has also had a chilling effect on Ukraine’s investment climate. In April 2017, Ukraine’s state security service raided the Kiev offices of Dragon Capital, one of the country's largest investment banks, over the alleged use of illegal software. Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman interrupted a cabinet meeting to express his surprise at the news of the raid on Dragon Capital, which he warned could affect investor sentiment. Dragon Capital CEO Tomas Fiala said the searches were part of a government-backed effort to pressure the bank, whose assets had been seized by allies of President Petro Poroshenko such as Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Granovsky.



In another long-running legal battle, American citizens Ilya and Vadim Segal allege that Ukrainian oligarch billionaire Dmitry Firtash (being extradited to the US to face bribery charges ) and his DF Group allegedly supported by MP Ivan Fursin and by Sergei Levochkin (former head of the Administration of President Yanukovich and Firtash partner at Inter News Channel) seized a $50 million soybean plant they owned through “a campaign of fraud, physical threats, coercion and corruption.” After a series of legal victories, the Segal brothers still struggle to get access to their factory.



In his meeting with Ukrainian President Poroshenko last June, Vice President Pence stressed the importance of “continued reforms to fight corruption, improve the business climate, and keep Ukraine's International Monetary Fund program on track.” This anodyne-sounding advice goes to the heart of Ukraine’s national epidemic. Curing the cancer of corruption will require radical surgery and The Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act might be one of the options to punish corrupted foreign officials."

Follow Her On Twitter At']",FOX News,"A new report released by a D.C. think tank closely aligned with top Democrats claims there was “clear collusion” between the Trump campaign and the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election, calling it “the biggest political scandal in American history.”

The Center for American Progress (CAP), the left-leaning group formerly run by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign chairman John Podesta, released the report from its Moscow Project on Wednesday.

The almost 40-page document, titled “Russiagate: The Depth of Collusion,” was authored by former State Department official and now-CAP senior fellow Max Bergmann, who catalogued what he described as the “depth and breadth” of connections between “Trump associates and Kremlin-connected figures.”

Bergmann’s report links out to multiple news reports and quotes from the Trump administration. He acknowledged there wasn’t “new” information in the report, describing it as a “comprehensive look” at reports and public testimony.

“When you put them [reports] together in a comprehensive way, it becomes quite obvious and clear that there was collusion,” Bergmann said, citing reports of “meetings and contacts” that occurred with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, and Carter Page.

Throughout the report, Bergmann claims that there were “two campaigns to elect Donald Trump: the Trump campaign and the Russian campaign,” citing Trump associates' communications with Russian officials.

The White House, though, has adamantly denied that any of the known meetings and contacts involving associates and Russian officials represent collusion. Rather, the Trump White House has tried to turn the table on Democrats, highlighting Clinton connections to Moscow including a high-dollar speech Bill Clinton delivered in Russia. They’ve also zeroed in on a reported meeting between a DNC consultant and Ukrainian officials last year where campaign issues reportedly were discussed.

Podesta, too, allegedly has Russia ties of his own. In 2011, a company, Joule Unlimited, reportedly announced Podesta’s appointment to its board. Months later, a Kremlin-backed investment firm reportedly pumped $35 million into Joule.

Last month, in an interview with Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo, Podesta was asked why he failed to disclose his role in the company prior to working as a counselor for then-President Barack Obama.

“Maria, that’s not true. I fully disclosed and was compliant,” Podesta told Bartiromo. But according to his financial disclosure forms, Podesta reportedly only listed two of the three entities that made up Joule Unlimited, and did not disclose his presence on the board.

In his report, Bergmann repeatedly refered to the controversial June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya and her associates, Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort. The meeting was billed to Trump Jr. as one to discuss Russian adoption – and also supposedly damaging information on Hillary Clinton.

The report did not refer to last week’s Senate testimony where a witness, Bill Browder, suggested the same company behind an infamous anti-Trump dossier also was involved in a Russian government-linked “smear campaign” against him over his sanctions efforts.

When asked about that testimony, Bergmann acknowledged Browder’s testimony was “amazing” but said “the report doesn’t even talk about the dossier, it was too long.”"

“Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent... went nowhere but had to listen,” the president’s son tweeted.

The reports, though, were causing new headaches for the Trump family with regard to congressional investigations, as a senior Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee said Monday the panel should now question Trump's eldest son.

Sen. Susan Collins of Maine told reporters that ""our intelligence committee needs to interview him and others who attended the meeting"" as part of the panel's probe into Russian interference in last year's election and possible collusion between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.

The Times has published a series of reports on the meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, leading to varying explanations from the Trump team. Trump’s eldest son initially said it was primarily about allowing Americans to adopt Russian children and “mentioned nothing about Mrs. Clinton.”

He later acknowledged he was told the Russian individual “might have information helpful to the campaign.”

During the meeting, Trump Jr. said in a statement, “the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton.” But he said her statements “were vague, ambiguous and made no sense” and it “became clear that she had no meaningful information.”

He said, “She then changed subjects and began discussing the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act. It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting.”

The meeting with Veselnitskaya was also attended by Paul J. Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman at the time, and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, according to The Times.

Donald Trump Jr. claimed Monday his statements were consistent.

“No inconsistency in statements, meeting ended up being primarily about adoptions. In response to further Q's I simply provided more details,” he tweeted.

Donald Trump Jr. also tweeted out a news article Monday morning that called the Times report a “big yawn.”

The reports could pose new complications for Trump associates and family members, though, as the president has sought to downplay any suggestion of coordination during the campaign with the Russians.

Mark Corallo, a spokesman for President Trump’s outside legal team, reportedly said, “The president was not aware of and did not attend the meeting.""

The Associated Press also reported Monday that a music publicist says he set up the meeting on behalf of a client in Moscow named Emin Agalarov.

In a statement to The Associated Press on Monday, Rob Goldstone said the lawyer said she had information about purported illegal campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee that she thought Donald Trump Jr. might find helpful.

Goldstone says Trump Jr. agreed to squeeze the meeting into a tight schedule. Trump appeared in a music video with Agalarov in 2013. The video was filmed while Trump was in Russia for the Miss Universe pageant.

This scrambled the usual partisan lines, where most conservative pundits back the Republican candidate and most liberal pundits support the Democrat. Some of the loudest #NeverTrump voices belonged to those on the right.

Trump delighted in taking them on, and of course he won.

Now, with the media furor over Don Jr. and his emails, they have ramped up their criticism once again. And that has deprived the White House of much of a cheering squad as the Russia story heats up once again.

It’s not that these conservative critics have a megaphone that approaches that of the White House. But it muddies the case that the “liberal media” are out to get Trump.

There are exceptions, of course. Sean Hannity, who interviewed Don Jr. Tuesday—the president’s son said that in retrospect he probably would have done things differently—told him during the sitdown: “Liberals in the destroy Trump media once again have worked themselves into frenzy. They're frothing at the mouth.”

Rush Limbaugh took on the “Drive-By Media,” saying: “I actually think I’m watching people lose their minds…This is the story that’s gonna get Trump thrown out of office. This is the story that’s gonna cause an uprising among the American people. Except they have done that practically every day for the last year, and certainly for the last six months.”

But others on the right said that Trump Jr.’s meeting with the Russian lawyer he was told had oppo research on Hillary Clinton—as documented in the emails he released—was troubling.

In “Don Jr.’s Disgraceful Meeting,” National Review says: ""No campaign professional would have accepted such a dodgy meeting the way Trump Jr. did, and no person with a strong sense of propriety — Russia is a hostile power run by a deeply corrupt regime — would have wanted to.""

The Weekly Standard, writing about U.S. sanctions against Moscow, says that ""the Trump team has lost all credibility on the question of Russia. Second-guessing by the media and politicians of both parties will be the inevitable accompaniment to every White House announcement about Vladimir Putin or Russia.”

Fox’s Charles Krauthammer said this about the president’s son, in light of the fact that his meeting with Veselnitskaya apparently went nowhere: “It’s a hell of a defense to say your collusion might be incompetent…

“If you get a call to go to a certain place in the middle of the night to pick up stolen goods and it turns out the stolen goods don’t show up but the cops show up,” he noted. “I think you’re going to have a very weak story saying, ‘Well, I got swindled here.’”

New York Times conservative Ross Douthat says the episode has convinced him to no longer give the president the benefit of the doubt.



The strongest defense mustered by some on the right is that Don Jr. broke no law.

Conservative blogger Erick Erickson says that “while I do not think it proves collusion or shows any illegality, it does show that Donald Trump, Jr. lacks credible judgment, any ethical standards, and his father has placed his company in terrible hands…

“Still, there does not seem to be anything illegal going on despite hysteria to the contrary.”

Even the usually pro-Trump New York Post ran an editorial titled “Donald Trump Jr. Is An Idiot.”

And Breitbart, Steve Bannon’s old stomping grounds, ran a relatively straightforward news story on the matter.



But there is still the chance that the mainstream media will go overboard on the story, prompting pushback from the right. You don’t have to think that Don Jr. acquitted himself with honor here to buy into the taunts by some Democrats of possible “treason.” What the younger Trump did could be viewed as wrong or naïve without being illegal.

A good clue to whether the press has gone overboard will be if you see these conservative critics saying that on reflection, what happened wasn’t all that bad."

DANA PERINO, GUEST HOST: Breaking tonight, President Trump urging his team to go on the offense against damaging distractions and leaks that threaten to derail his agenda, and the attorney general stepping to the plate with a major new effort that could land to leakers in jail. That's ""The Story."" Good evening, I'm Dana Perino in for Martha MacCallum.

Fox News confirming that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is preparing a major announcement unveiling a high profile criminal leak investigation, specifically targeting those behind an unauthorized breach of sensitive intelligence information. In moments, we'll be joined by Charles Krauthammer on what he thinks is behind this new Justice Department effort. But first, Chief National Correspondent, Ed Henry, live at the White House on what we may hear, Ed.

ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Dana, Fox News has learned that Jeff Sessions will announce this crackdown as early as Friday. Really, a critical move, because President Trump and his top aides believe that this parade of leaks has not only been damaging to his administration, but some of them have involved classified information, it would actually involve breaking the law. So, top officials here tell us that the announcement by Sessions will be an overview of the Justice Department's battle plan to take a much sharper look at some of the recent news reports with some of this sensitive intelligence material, rather than an announcement of specific prosecutions.

Now, while Sessions and his advisors stressed that this crackdown has been in the works for some time, we have to note the context of this, of course, is coming after the president put intense pressure on his attorney general to act with tweets last month. They call Sessions beleaguered and demand of action on leaks; one tweet declaring ""Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign -- 'quietly working to boost Clinton.' So, where is the investigation, attorney general?"" He also cited our own Sean Hannity, followed by a second presidential tweet declaring, ""Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a very weak position on Hillary Clinton's crimes (where are e-mails and DNC server) and Intel leakers!"" Now, in an exclusive with our own Tucker Carlson, Sessions was blunt in declaring he expects this will get the ball rolling on actual criminal prosecutions.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JEFF SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Go to jail, if we can make cases they are going to jail. That will be our advocacy, which we've been working on before. And the president has every right to ask the Department of Justice to be more aggressive in that, and we intend to.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HENRY: So, the attorney general saying that he will zero in on actual criminal leaks, while the legal but damaging palace intrigue leaks we've seen in the media, now have to be plugged, of course, by the new chief of staff General John F. Kelly, after he ousted Anthony Scaramucci who had been making that one of his principal duties. With the hours of Scaramucci's exit yesterday, though, there was this major leak, yet again in the Washington Post alleging that President Trump himself directed what became a misleading statement about his son Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting at Trump Tower last summer, Dana.

PERINO: All right. And that leak, certainly, wouldn't be under the attorney general's purview, but you're right, the new chief of staff. Thank you, Ed. Here with more is Charles Krauthammer; he's a Syndicated Columnist and a Fox News Contributor. So, Charles, we know that the president wanted this to be a priority of the attorney general. It sounds to me like he's not going to be frog-marching anybody in front of the cameras, but he's going to say, we are getting serious about this. And I assume that the attorney general hopes that that will stop what they're calling it ""culture of leaks."" What do you think?

CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, generally speaking, you'd expect something this splashy would be there frog-marching of a perpetrator or two. A little bit of handcuffs, a little bit of drama, and actually have cases to present. No cases to present, it makes you think that this is part of Attorney General Sessions trying to keep his job. Now, there's nothing wrong with going about looking for illegal leaks, particularly from the administration: unmasking, and all of that stuff -- that's right. But given the context, to use a word Ed Henry used, this is clearly an attorney general under siege, being humiliated, and attacked by his own president, trying to show that he's a good soldier. I don't think it actually does him a lot of credit having to be so obsequious about the president's demand, but that's the way that is and that's how he'll keep his job.

PERINO: But if it keeps the tweet against him at bay -- I get that maybe helps him do the rest of his job. But if I can pray upon your previous experience, what is the psychology behind leakers? Do you think that -- are they trying to further a story? Is it out of the goodness of their hearts? Or do they want fame and fortune? Or maybe like they want attention from the press? Where does it come from?

KRAUTHAMMER: Well, this is on nonmedical diagnosis here. Generally speaking, it's people who are committed to a cause and think that the cause will be advanced by the leak. Either a negative cause, meaning, you want to bring people down whom you think are hurting the country, or that you want to expose the truth like in Watergate. I mean, some people, I guess, do it for the glory of it, but leakers, generally, don't get glorified. You end up like Julian Assange, hiding out for six years in the Ecuadorian Embassy. That's not exactly glory.

PERINO: So, there are two different types of leaks; what Attorney General Jeff Sessions will talk about is the National Security- related intelligence information leaks that are criminal.

KRAUTHAMMER: Right.

PERINO: But now, as Ed Henry was suggesting, so we have a new Chief of Staff, General John Kelly, is coming into a White House that has had leaks about, sort of, what's going on inside the White House that they don't like either. What can a chief of staff actually do to stop that kind of thing?

KRAUTHAMMER: Fire people, who are caught, and try to make it very clear that that will be the penalty so that you get a deterrent effect. There was a sense up until Kelly's had session a day ago, that the White House was a free fire zone, where if you had a personal enemy or you had certain ambitions forwarded by arrival in the White House, you could just be leaking crazily to try to embarrass, hurt them, or to bring them down.

You know, Scaramucci was pretty open about it, and he wasn't exactly a secret leaker; he was more of a suicide bomber who too took a whole bunch of people down with him. So, you've got this culture of free-for-all and what you needed. And I think Trump did exactly the right thing: you bring in a Marine general who has a sense of the chain of command and order to read everybody the Riot Act. And presumably, it will reduce the number of leaks in the future. But it isn't going to do a thing about the ones that have already leaked out, and which have been so damaging up until now.

PERINO: I know that I would've never wanted to disappoint chiefs of staff -- Andy Carter and Josh Bolten -- when I worked there. If I could ask you just one last question about the other piece of this that Ed Henry brought up, which is the leak in the Washington Post last night about this statement that was written about Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting in Trump Tower with the Russian lawyer, that the White House basically said today that the president just weighed in like any father would do. Do you think that that will pass muster with either the press or maybe even the investigation?

KRAUTHAMMER: There's no way around it. This is bad news for the White House. It's not a felony; it's not criminal to mislead the American people. God knows, Bill Clinton did that a million times, and he was nailed for what he said in the deposition, which is a whole different thing. But if lying or misleading or a criminal offense, we'd have to empty out the congress. Nonetheless, it looks very bad. First, because the White House had said, the president was not involved whatsoever; you got that from Jay Sekulow, the president's own lawyer repeatedly said that, so that is not true. And second, because it implicates the president in an event, the meeting with the agent of the Russian government who was peddling dirt on Hillary, which is the one episode of collusion that is simply undeniable. Again, not necessarily criminal --

PERINO: Right.

KRAUTHAMMER: You don't impeach somebody over that, but that is collusion. Bungled collusion, (INAUDIBLE) collusion, is nonetheless collusion. And you've got the first time the president is involved even if indirectly and after the fact.

PERINO: All right. Charles Krauthammer, thank you so much.

KRAUTHAMMER: My pleasure.

PERINO: All right. Joining me now is Charles Hurt, a Columnist for the Washington Times and a Fox News Contributor; and Mary Anne Marsh, who is a Democratic Strategist. If could just be four-week ago to you, I want to have you listen to Corey Lewandowski who talked about the leaks that are actually happening within the West Wing. Let's listen to that.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER MANAGER OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN: Look, I think the president's frustration was probably what the amount of leaking coming from the White House. If Reince couldn't control those leaks and also he's continued to permeate, then, he was the one who's ultimately responsible. And General Kelly is brought in to make sure those leaks do not continue.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PERINO: Now, Charles, let me start with you because you're a journalist. I've assumed that you are probably the recipient of some leaks, possibly, even back in the day when we work together when I was at the White House. What do you make of this whole thing? And do you think General Kelly will be able to stop leaks coming from inside the West Wing, at least?

CHARLES HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND COLUMNIST FOR THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Well, certainly, it's going to be -- it's going to be a tall order for him, but I do think that that kind of discipline that he brings to it is exactly what's needed. And of course, you know, anybody in the press loves leaks. We love, you know, any sort of information that we can get. But what I think is so interesting about so many of the leaks that we see now, first of all, a lot of the leaks turned out not to be true. A lot of stories that are printed based on those leaks wind up later not being true. But the other thing that I think is so disturbing about a lot of it is that the leaks are so damaging to the president.

And there are -- so many of the accusations and the smear is directed at the president. And there are two things there: one is there's a real discipline problem that the administration has to fix. But the other thing is, and this is something that I think that a lot of people, it's sort of a badge of honor in some sorts is the degree to which so many people inside the administration who are not necessarily loyalist but who feel threatened by this president and really do want to do him damage, because he's going to change the way things operate around here. And you know, that's not a bad thing, but they have to get a control of these things.

PERINO: So, Mary Anne, certainly leaks are sometimes strategic, right? Sometimes the -- leaks come in all sort of different forms. And there have been some reporters who were trigger-happy and went with leaks that ended up not being true. Do you think the Democrats run any risk of overplaying their hand, thinking that every leak is going to lead to the impeachment of President Trump?

MARY ANNE MARSH, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think only the truth could lead anywhere and take you down that path. But I think the real point here is, look at why people are leaking from the White House about Russia. And there are only two reasons: one is you're trying to persuade Trump to do something and change his behavior that you failed to do privately, and you hope he'll do it if he sees it publicly in the media which he's a voracious consumer of. The other reason is to save yourself. And neither one of those things puts you in a very good place if you're at the White House because that means you're trying to outrun the truth if you're Donald Trump.

Trump has basically made the bet that it would hurt him more, to tell the truth, today, than to tell a lie and get caught tomorrow. And when you're in that place, things don't get better from here. Could the Democrats overplay their hand? It is possible, but what we've seen time and time again is when Donald Trump and the White House has one thing, more often than not including today, it's the truth is something totally different and it starts to add up. And that's a bad place to be for any White House.

PERINO: I have wondered, Charlie, why the White House doesn't just continue to refer to the investigation and not answer everything single question that comes up? Or do you think that that actually would be more damaging for them? Because there are these little drifts that come out like last night about the statement that was drafted for Air Force One, what do you think?

HURT: Well, I think that to some degree, you know, these guys are at this for six months. And before this, they have -- you know, the only experience they have with politics is, of course, running their campaign that wound up being spectacularly successful, though no one expected it to be. They're sort of reinventing the wheel all the time which is a great thing about Donald Trump, but it's a maddening thing in situations like this. Because you're exactly right, they should just refer everything to the investigation, because nobody, and nobody outside of Democrats, and outside of people in Washington cares about any of this stuff. And you really could get --

PERINO: What do you make -- Mary Anne, let me give you the last word, because you hear that a lot that the White House has, well, actually, nobody cares about this, and some of the polling bears that out, what do you think?

MARSH: I think that people care about it a lot. They may not respond to that particular issue, but look at Donald Trump's polling; he's under water everywhere in every single poll now. And you've seen the level of trust that he holds with the American people is at the lowest place it's been in -- since he's gone into the office. That line has only gone down, and you cannot earn trust back. It's the most valuable commodity you have in elected office, but certainly, if you're in the White House. And to earn that back, would take years, it's not years more; it's nearly impossible. And in six months, Donald Trump has lost the trust of the vast majority of the American people, but for 35 percent of the country who still support.

PERINO: Although with that number, he actually -- I mean, it's not that much lower than what he won the presidency with. So, he hasn't gone down too much in that regard. All right, thank you both.

HURT: Thanks, Dana.

MARSH: Thank you.

PERINO: Coming up, new signals from the White House tonight, suggesting that we may be hearing their plans to deal with North Korea in the not-so- distant future, that is still ahead. Plus, one feminist writer suggested it would be ""a betrayal of every woman who has ever supported the Democratic Party,"" the latest issue dividing the left is next. And the Democrats squabble, the Republicans on the Hill are getting ready to make tax reform the next legislative goal. Karl Rove is here to take us through exactly how the president can win the looming battle.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We'll be submitting an infrastructure bill in the not very distant future. We're going to be submitting a tax bill in the very near future.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.: We stand for three simple things. First, we're going to increase people's pay. Second, we're going to reduce their everyday expenses. And third, we're going to provide workers the tools they need for the 21st-century economy.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PERINO: Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer's message to his party being largely ignored that according to Politico that wrote some on his own party are wondering whether they need a message at all besides resistance. The dustup comes as the chair of the Democrats House campaign arm is saying his party should be willing to support candidates who oppose abortion rights, setting off some prominent progressives. Ilyse Hogue, President of the pro-choice group NARAL, tweeting: ""Any compromise is akin to allowing a far-right, religiously warped, anti-Democratic force to infect the Democratic Party so that they can write laws that control women."" Writer Lauren Duka adding, ""This will be a betrayal of every woman who has ever supported the Democratic Party.""

Joining us now: Dana Loesch, she's host of ""Dana"" on The Blaze T.V.; and Richard Fowler, Senior Fellow at New Leaders Council and, of course, a Fox News contributor. So, I wanted to talk about the abortion messaging for a second. Because, Richard, the man in charge of (INAUDIBLE), who is basically the one for the Democrats trying to make sure that the Democrats can win some House seats. He said you know, look, we should be open to the fact that some people that want to run as Democrats are going to be pro- life. And that set all of these other progressive women off. And I just wonder from your perspective, is it a good idea for the Democrats to be shrinking their tent at this point?

RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND SENIOR FELLOW AT NEW LEADERS COUNCIL: It's not a matter of shrinking their tent. Thanks for having me, Dana. It's a matter of really understanding where the party is and sticking to what we believe in. One thing you can learn from Donald Trump, whether you like him or not is he has a message and he's sticking to it. Was it unpopular with some Republicans? Absolutely. Did people -- did some Republicans say that they were never Trump-ers? Absolutely. But he's President of the United States.

This issue, now, when I say pro -- and I want to be very clear, I am pro- choice, I am not pro-abortion. I think pro-choice means more than just, you know, a woman being able to have access to, you know, abortion care, but also means having access to contraception, it means being able to get birth control, it means they will go to planned-parenthood clinic, it means all of these things, right? And so, when you say that we're going to endorse candidates that against that, that speaks to moving away from who we are as Democrats and who we've always been.

PERINO: But Dana, I have followed the stuff pretty closely. I haven't heard of a Republican in years saying that -- you know, (INAUDIBLE) Republican saying they want to restrict contraception. I think that this issue has actually matured, and you had Republicans actually running on -- well, Cory Gardner of Colorado, the Senator, he ran on a platform saying he thought birth control should be widely available and over-the-counter.

DANA LOESCH, THE BLAZE TV HOST: Exactly.

PERINO: So, I just feel like the Democrats are trying to keep Republicans in a box that they've actually broken out of it.

LOESCH: That's right, Dana, it's so good to see you. It's a strong man argument that they use because -- and you hit the nail on the head. Republicans are the party that's push for over-the-counter birth control, of course, that endangers some of the special interests that fund the Democratic Party. I'm not, Dana, I'm not going to criticize Democrats for finally coming around and adopting a Republican platform. And even though it's not based on the sanctity of life; it's on the sanctity of getting votes, I'll take that if it saves some infants. I will all totally take that all day long. I'm excited to see it. It's actually one of the first real smart things that I've heard from Democrats in the past eight years.

They're looking to expand their coalition, and they have to. When you look at the amount of Democrats that voted for Donald Trump, not because they liked him, but because they loathed Hillary Clinton and Democrats have nobody else to put up. I mean, they really need to expand their base. They realize they've got to pick up 24 seats, and the only way to do that, Dana, is to expand that coalition.

PERINO: Well, and the other thing I would say is that the president stuck to a message during the campaign about economic opportunity and growth. And Richard isn't that what Chuck Schumer was saying the other day, which is we've got to figure out a way to get back to those issues so that we can take those voters who had voted for Obama, then voted for Trump to try to get them back in the category. Talking about abortion, I don't think it's necessarily going to be the winning thing, but it's more about the economy. And do the Democrats even need a national message because, pretty much, it seems like letting a thousand flowers bloom is the new strategy?

FOWLER: Well, I think we do need a national message. And I'm happy to see a better - the better deal that came out last week that Chuck Schumer announced, and I think Democrats should be talking about it. But let's be very clear here, you know, having a pro-choice message and having an economic message isn't mutually exclusive. Those two things didn't exist by themselves. And another point to speak to what, Dana, mentioned about this idea of Republicans being for contraception, if you remember correctly during the Affordable Care Act fight seven or eight years ago, it was Republicans that blocked health care companies from covering birth control for women who worked at religious institutions --

PERINO: Richard, that is not --

FOWLER: That is true.

LOESCH: That's false, Richard.

FOWLER: That is true.

PERINO: That is -- no.

LOESCH: No. They only --

FOWLER: It was Republicans.

LOESCH: No, no, Richard. Richard, as a woman, let me, a woman, explain to you.

PERINO: Then I'll give you the last word as a woman.

LOESCH: Insurance companies were not -- they were not blocked from offering contraception. They covered contraception for women's health needs; it was for recreational, sexual recreational purposes that companies were not forced, and insurance was not forced to cover it. So, there is a difference.

FOWLER: But they should be forced to cover it in all cases. That's --

(CROSSTALK)

PERINO: Well, that was the dispute.

LOESCH: If I want to buy condoms, why am I going to ask you to pay for my sexual active recreational birth control?

FOWLER: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

PERINO: Last word to you, Richard, then we got to go.

FOWLER: Because Insurance companies already cover Cialis and Viagra, that's recreational sex (INAUDIBLE), so why can't they cover condoms?

LOESCH: And they cover for -- birth control for health reasons, not for recreational.

FOWLER: I mean, why can't they cover birth control?

LOESCH: Not for recreational, but for health reason.

FOWLER: But if they cover Cialis and they cover Viagra, why can't they cover birth control?

PERINO: OK. We got to run.

LOESCH: Dana, good to see you.

PERINO: All right. Don't forget my book, Dana. You're the one that we're going to write in the future.

LOESCH: Yes, I know right. I have (INAUDIBLE) on you.

PERINO: Tweets we never sent: this is what it's going to be.

(LAUGHTER)

PERINO: All right. Coming up, Senator Marco Rubio is here to tell us why he just delivered a national message to Venezuela. Plus, talk about some provocative comments from one of his fellow GOP senators. And despite the seeming chaos inside the walls of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House is quietly working to uphold one of President Trump's biggest campaign promises; filling our nation's courts with conservative judges, an update on the progress ahead. Plus, he was the man behind the strategy that led to the Bush tax cuts. Up next, Karl Rove explains how Trump can go even further.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

PERINO: President Trump setting his sights on tax reform earlier today at the White House. And with the newly minted the chief of staff, John Kelly at the helm, Republicans on Capitol Hill are hopeful that a tax overhaul is coming soon.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-K.Y., SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: What we intend to do is to take up tax reform when we come back after Labor Day. I don't think that this is going to be 1986 when you had a bipartisan effort to scrub the code.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PERINO: So, how exactly should the White House roll out their messaging on this? Joining us now with his tips is Karl Rove, former Senior Advisor to President George W. Bush and a Fox News Contributor. So, in this debate, Karl, I think that there are optimists and pessimists. Optimists say, well, obviously we need tax reform; the country needs it for sorts of reasons, for fairness, and for economic growth. And then, you have pessimists who say, well, it's not been done for 30 years, it's going to be so hard; they couldn't get health care done. Which are you, an optimist or a pessimist?

KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Well, I'm generally an optimist. I'm one of those kids like Ronald Reagan described, you got up and saw the pile of manure under the Christmas tree and dug into it trying to find the pony that was supposed to be in there. So, even after health care went down, I'm hopeful and I'm actually pretty optimistic that they're going to get tax reform measure done, a tax cut done. It's not going to be as big and as bold as we probably would've liked it to have been, particularly after the health care defeat, but it's going to be big enough and hopefully strong enough to give us a go --

PERINO: So, what would -- what do you think they should do? We heard that the president will be traveling in August. He's going to hit some battleground states, I understand to try to sell this message. How else should they try to get this across the finish line?

ROVE: Well, first of all, lower expectations. I noticed there's a tendency among members of the administration say we're going to get done now, or we're going to get it soon, and it's going to be big, and it's going to be great. This is going to be a tough lift because getting it passed the house they've got a pretty good discipline there, but even there it's tough. And then getting it through the senate with 52 votes is going to be tough. So lower the expectations. Second of all, dial up the coordination. The good news is that seems to be being done. You notice there're been regular meetings between Paul Ryan and Congressman Kevin Brady of Texas, chairman of ways and means, Leader McConnell, and the chairman senate finance committee Orin Hatch, Plus Steven Mnuchin, Gary Cohn, and other White House.

PERINO: And outside groups.

ROVE: And outside groups, which is -- let me come to that in just a minute. But keep that coordination going forward because you need to stay it out. And third, expand the number of voices that are being heard in this. And you're right, the outside groups, particularly the business community are getting revved up about this, and it's important to do that. But overall, you need to have the president delivery a more, I think, persuasive, consistent, and educational message. He's got to tell the American people why he wants this in more than 140 characters. This is going to require set piece speeches. It's going to require marshaling the evidence as to why this is important to describe in reasonable terms what might happen. Don't raise the expectations. Don't oversell this. Don't promise that, you know, people are going to able to keep their plans of they like their plan, that kind of thing.

PERINO: We have Bill McGurn of the Wall Street Journal on later in the show, and he argued today in the Wall Street Journal that the president should give an oval office address on tax reform. Would you advocate for that?

ROVE: Oh, I agree. And I think even more important than just one address was, what I took away from that article was is that the president has a bully pulpit, and Bill was saying make regular use of it, and that means you need to have a plan. The White House has been without a planner. Sure, they have a press secretary, but as you and I both know, the communication director principle function is to develop a plan to make all of the parts of the administration move in unison with their allies on Capitol Hill.

PERINO: Yeah, because basically you are running a campaign.

ROVE: Absolutely.

PERINO: Speaking of the campaign, the president made promises about making sure that we were getting for the country, conservative judges, across a slate of judges in the country. Is he fulfilling that promise from your standpoint?

ROVE: Oh, absolutely. His nominees for not just the Supreme Court with Judge Gorsuch, but his nominees for the pellet bench and these district benches, I just keep hearing terrific things about the people that he's putting forward. And I think this is going to be one of the great achievements in his first year in office is that he has done so well in this regard. And again, it's a lesson for us because he has not -- this has not been insular. Don McGahn, the president's council has been reaching out to outside groups, the federal society, and Leonard Leo and other conservatives who are interested in this have been hearing from the White House, asked for their suggestions. They've been doing a lot of consultation with senators about this. I think this is a lesson for the White House on how they can be more successful by relying on allies outside the west wing.

PERINO: Rights. So, high impact but not a lot of headlines, but still getting a lot of that done. All right. Karl Rove, thank you so much. Still ahead in the wake of North Korea's longest range missile test yet, new indications suggesting the administration is ready to act. Ed Henry is coming up with some interesting quotes from the White House tonight. Plus, a series of power grabs from Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, spark deadly protest in a country spiraling into chaos. Senator Marco Rubio is here on the heel of his address to the Venezuelan people to explain why this should matter to America.

PERINO: That was shocking new videos showing two prominent opposition leaders being dragged away to prison after being seized from their homes in the middle of the night by state security agents. This comes just days after an illegitimate election ignites deadly protest, and yields more power to the dictatorship rule of Nicolas Maduro. He's now one of just four heads of states personally sanctioned by President Donald Trump. Joining me now to discuss America's stake in this story, is one of Maduro's most ardent opponent, the man who just delivered a speech on Venezuela TV, Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Senator, thank you for joining me. I know that this is not a new issue to you. You've been covering it for a while. And I wonder if you could explain to people what is happening there, and why you decided to be the Americans that stood up and gave a speech in Spanish to the people of Venezuela. What did you say to them?

SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA.: Well, first of all, let's see what's happening there. What's happening there, Hugo Chaves dies leaves behind what's already kind of a disaster because he's given away all those oil to spend money through a socialist model. This new guy takes over, and basically realizes he can't win an election. His party lost the election. He lost the legislative branch. So he comes with this idea called the constituent assembly. They're wiping out the national assembly, their congress, and replacing it with a Cuban style governments, where basically there're no more direct elections of their representative, all designed to fortify themselves in power.

What this leads to -- why this matter to the United States, number one, thousands of asylum-seekers from Venezuela are already applying the fastest growth of any country in the world, so it's placing migratory pressure on the United States. Number two, it's our value and it is our hemisphere, we have not had a dictatorship emerge in this region in this way in 40 years. This is the first lost or attempted loss of a democracy since the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. But third, let's play this out. So you've got Venezuela now in play with Maduro and things they're doing. They can now destabilize Columbia, because the narco-traffickers in Colombia are people they've aided for a long time, important ally to the United States, and then move west. That takes you into Central America, because that's where the migratory and drug trafficking pressure comes against the United States.

They now threaten the government of Honduras with a leftist candidate. They've already threaten El Salvador is already halfway there with its current leadership. Nicaragua is already all the way there. Guatemala is on the verge of being a failed state because of the challenges it faces. All of this pushing into Mexico who itself has a left of center Chavez-type figure running for president a year from now. And so, you can very quickly see within four years if this works in Venezuela, you could see it spread to Colombia, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua it's already there, El Salvador, and ultimately into Mexico and right to the U.S. border. So this is -- you've got to think forward on a couple of these things, but these dominoes begin to fall, and suddenly we have a very unstable region where anti-Americanism and narco trafficking are putting tremendous pressure on our country, and not to mention the migratory pressures that follow.

PERINO: Sir, you are the only U.S. senator who could have delivered that speech last night in Spanish, what was your main message to them?

RUBIO: My main message is I've seen this happen before. I'm not seeking to interfere in the internal affairs of Venezuela. All we're asking for is for the government of Venezuela to follow its own constitution. Hold free and fair election, and let the people vote for whoever they want. But I also spoke to them as someone who was born and raised in a community shaped by the tragedy of this hemisphere, by the Sandinistas' in Nicaragua, by the Castro's in Cuba, and by the tyranny that results -- that leads to corruption, which we've seen massive amounts of corruption.

And so my point to them is the United States like any sovereign country has a right to decide who they deal with and on what terms. And we are not going to stand by and watch as this anti-American dictator consolidates himself in power, violates the rights of his people, and ultimately in the long term threatens the United States. So it's a message of solidarity and in support for what President Trump has done and what he intends to do in the days to come.

PERINO: Senator, did you see the report in the Washington Post that says that there might be a change of a mission statement language at the state department taking out the two words, justice and democracy, so that it would maybe say something like, we promote the security, prosperity, and interest of the American people globally, does that concern you that the state department might be taking those words out?

RUBIO: It does, because I think democracy and stability and prosperity go hand in hand. Here's the bottomline, when in a country where people get to vote and choose their leaders, they're less likely to start a war, and they're more likely to be more prosperous, because those leaders, every two, every four, every five years have to answer to their people. This is not about left versus right. One of the things I made last -- points I made last night, in Argentina they have presidents on the left and on the rights, but they're elected. Brazil is going through a constitutional crisis right now, but it's being decided through their court system. Mexico has elections. Chile has gone left and right from one time to another. That's not the issue. The issue is when people -- democracies don't generally start conflicts with other democracies, because their people won't tolerate it. Dictatorships do because they don't have to answer to anybody.

PERINO: It doesn't seem like the best time to be actually revising that mission statement, in particular, but I guess we'll wait to hear from the secretary on that. I get to ask you one last question, I've just talked to Karl Rove, we are talking about tax reform, and I asked him if he was an optimist or a pessimist that could get done, he said optimist. And I know you have a great interest in this, especially, when it comes to working with Ivanka Trump on the tax credit. Where are you, optimistic?

RUBIO: I am, because I think we're -- unlike health care, I think there's a strong consensus in the Republican Party for pro-growth tax strategy. In fact, we have to do it. A lot of this economic growth we're seeing now is because that expectation of tax reform is already built-in to the growth. They're anticipating it, and that's what it's growing. And if it doesn't happen, we could see the reverse effect very quickly, and we'll be the blame. So we've got to get it done. And I do believe that we need to be the pro-family party, the most important institution in society is the family. The most important job any of us have is to be a parent. It simply cost more money than it ever cost before to raise children now in the 21st century. Our tax code should account for that. And that's why I met with Ivanka on it again today. We're going to get that done as well.

PERINO: It's really important to talk about children. We've talk a lot about the older population as we should, but the children need more attention. Thank you, senator. We really appreciate your time.

RUBIO: Thank you, Dana. Thank you.

PERINO: Up next, we go back to the White House as some new comments may indicate the U.S. is ready to make its move against Kim Jong-un. Plus, the president says twitter is his best way to cut through the noise, but is he ignoring a better way to get out his message? Bill McGurn and Howard Kurtz, straight ahead.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE: We're trying to convey to the North Koreans, we are not your enemy, we're not your threat, but you're presenting an unacceptable threat to us. And we have to respond.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PERINO: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson strongly suggesting that the U.S. is on a brink of making its move against an increasingly aggressive and antagonistic North Korea. His comments putting the world on notice with some speculating that the U.S. may take preemptive action against a rogue nation. Fox News chief -- national correspondent Ed Henry is back with some new messaging coming from the White House tonight on North Korea. Ed.

ED HENRY, FOX NEWS: Well, Dana, you're right. It's very significant that for the last two days Sarah Huckabee Sanders at that White House podium has not ruled out the possibility of a so-called first strike, that the U.S. could launch an attack against North Korea to try and deter its nuclear weapons program, this coming because the stakes could not be any higher right now. After the testing late last week of an intercontinental ballistic missile by North Korea, national security experts now warning us that they may be able to reach -- be able to reach any big city in the United States with any of their missiles in the days ahead, that's right, North Korea may now have the range to attack major U.S. cities ranging from L.A. to even New York and Boston. And yet, that's getting very little attention right now compared to the health care failure, White House staff moves, or Russian interference.

In fact, Jerry Seib frame it perfectly today in the Wall Street Journal when he wrote that North Korea may soon launch, quote, another underground test of a nuclear device, a problem a lot more important than who's up and who's down in the White House this week. President Trump has been direct in recent weeks about saying China has not done nearly enough to help deter this threats. And today, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made clear this is an urgent situation, but the administration is still optimistic that a diplomatic solution can be reached.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TILLERSON: We do believe China has a special and unique relationship because of this significant economic activity to influence North Korean regime in ways that no one else can. That's why we continue to call upon them to use that influence with North Korea to create the conditions where we can have a productive dialogue.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HENRY: Still the possibility of war is very much alive. Republican Lindsey Graham, today, declaring the only military option for President Trump is to destroy not just North Korea's nuclear program, but to destroy the nation of North Korea itself. Pressed on that again at the podium, Sarah Huckabee Sanders said all options are on the table, but she stressed as we've heard before from this president, he's not going to telegraph what he plans to do in the days ahead, Dana.

PERINO: All right. Ed, thanks so much for keeping tabs on that. While the president said today that twitter is the best method for getting his message out, Wall Street Journal editorial board member Bill McGurn suggested today there is an even more powerful tool, the oval office address. And there are some suggestion that we could see one sooner rather than later. Joining me to discuss is Bill McGurn, the former chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush, and Howard Kurtz, Fox News media analyst and host of Media Buzz. So Bill, you argue that one of the best tools that a president can use is the power of an oval office address, because of what it will mean and what it shows. Do you think he should do that on tax reform?

BILL MCGURN, FORMER CHIEH SPEECHWRITER FOR PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Yes, I think he ought to have done it on health care reform. He might have had a different outcome. Look, I'm not saying that twitter is not useful, but it is one of the tools of the presidency as we talked before. When a president gives the state of the union, for example in congress, just think of it, the opposition, which ever party, it always look so diminished because their stage is not nearly as grand as speaking to both houses of congress. Same thing with the oval office, it's a chance for the president to speak directly to the American people, take them into the oval office, he's usually behind the desk as you know, and make his case. It's one of the greatest tools. Like gems, it has to have a certain rarity to have some value. But it was surprising to me that it went unused, tremendous bully pulpit.

PERINO: So it's been six months, Howie, that the president has been in office, and we haven't really seen anything major oval office address, do you think that there is some reluctance from the White House to do it?

HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA ANALYST: I'm really been puzzled, Dana, by the president's avoidance of the major TV speech. It was the missing element of the health care fight. And, as you know, there's a whole process, you have to ask the networks for TV time. Hardly a problem in a cable news environment where even his spokesman's briefings are all carried live. And then it's the media build up, the most important speech of Donald Trump presidency. Then come the speech -- and debating the speech for a couple of days. It's really is the way of moving public opinion. And I'm surprised it's a tool, as Bill says, the president has not chosen to use so far.

PERINO: The other reason to an oval office address, Bill, that you argue is because it lets congress know what the president wants, what his policies will be, what his priorities would be, and in this case with tax reform, especially if you have some Democratic senators in red states, they might feel that pressure from their constituents.

MCGURN: Yeah, all of them might. In this case, maybe Republicans from some states might have felt some pressure. Look, it's a chance -- the president is the only one then can speak to the nation like this and give his priorities. The example I use was Reagan in '81 on tax cuts, which a lot of people were skeptical about. July 27, 1981, he went on the oval office, gave his address, spoke to the American people, and then he asked them, call your congressman and senators and let them know. And Tip O'Neill said it was like the greatest blitz he has ever seen. And that was missing. So, again, I don't want to say twitter is useless or so forth, but this is a powerful -- I mean, Reagan was an actor and he recognized the stage is important.

PERINO: But that is an interesting thing, Howie, because when you think about this president who understand television and how things look, the power of an oval office address and all the lead up to it, I mean they can make this last like two weeks.

KURTZ: Absolutely, but I think the president just naturally prefers to sort of riff at these rallies.

PERINO: Oh, sure.

KURTZ: . these freewheeling speeches. I mean, there's a lot to be said to that.

PERINO: I will tell you, Howie, that Bill and I work for a president who did not like to sit down behind the desk and read from a teleprompter, because you feel -- even though you're speaking to the world, you feel all alone, and it feels like you're talking into a box. And you can't see anybody and you can't get a feel for it.

(CROSSTALK)

KURTZ: I think beyond that, Dana, Donald Trump views that -- the traditional press conferences, the traditional speech, as kind of too slow, too traditional, too 20th century, and in fact, you know, it is a tool that influences the elites. You say, who cares about elite opinion, but that in turn could affect public opinion people, write op-ed, they go on cable news segments, and so, you know, president has a lot of tools available. This is one he has not chosen to use.

PERINO: I have to say, my little piece of advice has been, I think that the president should just surprise everyone, walk in, and do a big press conference and just change all the news.

KURTZ: You'll get the credit if he does it in the next couple of days.

PERINO: OK. We've got to go. Thank you so much. We'll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

PERINO: Thanks for being a part of ""The Story"" tonight. Tucker is up next. He'll have part two of MS-13 series he's doing. Then, stay tuned to see me and the gang on ""The Five"" at 9. Have a great night.

Krauthammer: 'Incompetence is Not a Good Defense' for Don Jr.

Jay Sekulow, an attorney representing President Donald Trump, told Sean Hannity that there is ""no illegality"" in Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer.

Trump Jr. was informed in a series of emails that attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya would offer him compromising information about Hillary Clinton in the June 2016 meeting.

Trump Jr. said nothing came from the meeting and he was unaware that Veselnitskaya was possibly Kremlin-connected.

On Tuesday, Trump Jr. released what he said was the “entire email chain” of conversations setting up the meeting.

Sekulow pointed out that Trump Jr. was completely transparent in releasing the emails, unlike Hillary Clinton, who deleted thousands of emails from her government email account as secretary of state.

He added that nothing actually transpired in the meeting with Veselnitskaya, which was also attended by then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior aide.

""There's a media frenzy on Russia now. This has been going on for several months. But when you look to see what actually took place, a meeting takes place, nothing happens as a result of this 15 or 20 minute meeting, and at the end of the day, there's no illegality.""

He said as an attorney, he can't see which statute or code section of U.S. law could possibly have been violated.

""Some of the theories that some of the commentators have put forward are ridiculous,"" Sekulow said. ""There was no illegality in that meeting. And on top of that, there was no information that was obtained.""

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I’m Chris Wallace.

Inauguration week is here. As President-elect Trump deals with an unverified dossier linking him to the Kremlin.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENT-ELECT: I think it's a disgrace, and that’s something that Germany would have done and did do.

WALLACE: We’ll discuss Mr. Trump's testy relationship with the intelligence community when we sit down with Vice President-elect Mike Pence just five days before he is sworn into office.

And we’ll find out why the nation's spy chiefs briefed Mr. Trump on the Russian rumors in an exclusive interview with CIA Director John Brennan. We’ll also ask him about the hot spots the Trump team faces, from ISIS to China. John Brennan, only on ""Fox News Sunday"".

Plus, the politics of why Hillary Clinton didn't win the election are still playing out.

REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALI., HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: The American people are owed the truth.

WALLACE: We’ll ask our Sunday panel about the Justice Department inspector general investigating FBI Director James Comey for possible misconduct.

And our power player of the week, the head of the presidential inaugural committee on pulling off this week’s big event.

TOM BARRACK, HEAD OF PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURAL COMMITTEE: It’s quite (INAUDIBLE) putting on the Olympics in 60 days.

WALLACE: All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington.

Donald Trump takes the oath of office in just five days, but on the brink of his presidency, questions about Russia's involvement in the election won't go away. Today, we want to discuss that and of the agenda with the man who will be sworn in next Friday as vice president.

We are honored to be joined here in studio by Mike Pence.

Mr. Vice President-elect, welcome back to his ""Fox News Sunday"".""

MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT: Thanks, Chris. It's good to be here. It’s an exciting week.

WALLACE: Democratic Congressman John Lewis, one of the icons of the civil rights movements, says that he is not going to attend the inauguration, and he has explained why. Here he is.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. JOHN LEWIS, D-GEORGIA: I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: What's your reaction to Congressman Lewis?

PENCE: Donald Trump won this election fair and square, thirty of 50 states, more counties than any Republican since Ronald Reagan, and the American people know that. And, while I have great respect for John Lewis, and for his contributions, particularly with the civil rights movement.

I was deeply disappointed to see someone of his stature question the legitimacy of Donald Trump's election as president and say he's not attending the inauguration, and I hope he reconsiders both positions. You know, we'd even had recounts in this election where the numbers for the president-elect had actually gone up. There's no question about the legitimacy of this election, and for John Lewis to make those statements is deeply disappointing.

This is also -- it's disappointing, too, because I truly do believe this is a time when the American people should be celebrating the peaceful transition of power. That's what this week is really all about, Chris, and to know that four living presidents will be on the stage acknowledging that peaceful transition of power, the world will be watching, will hear the first remarks that Donald will make as president of the United States in his inaugural address.

I just -- I hope that John Lewis, and some others who have joined his plans to take a pass on the inauguration, will rethink that, will be with us and will celebrate this extraordinary moment in the life of our nation and the life of democracy.

WALLACE: I like to ask you as well -- you talked about Lewis’ comments about Mr. Trump. But also, I’d also like to ask about Mr. Trump's comments about Mr. Lewis. I want to put up this tweet, because in response, the president-elect called John Lewis ""all talk, talk, talk, no action.""

Can he really say that about the man who got his head cracked open walking across the Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, on Bloody Sunday, ""all talk, no action""?

PENCE: Well --

WALLACE: Do you think that's appropriate?

PENCE: I think -- I think Donald Trump has the right to defend himself. When someone of John Lewis' stature, someone who is not only an icon in the civil rights movement, but also someone who by virtue of his sacrifice on that day that we know as Bloody Sunday, he crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge and he suffered that abuse and it was -- it was true that that the voting rights -- for someone to use his stature to use terms like this is not a legitimate president, it’s just -- it's just deeply disappointing to me, and I hope he reconsiders it.

But what Donald Trump was talking about their was literally generations of failed policies coming out of Washington, D.C., that have failed to many families and too many cities across this country. I will tell you, Donald Trump is a man who is profoundly impatient with failure. And you saw in the campaign, he went to major cities in this country and said we are going to bring safety to our streets. We’re going to bring school choice to our children. We’re going to bring jobs and opportunities to our cities.

You remember that great line ""what the heck do you have to lose?"" He’s committed to being president of all the people in this country and to bring new jobs and prosperity in ways that the failed liberal policies of the last several generations have not.

WALLACE: Let me pick up on another controversy this week, because Mr. Trump has been going after the intelligence community, especially after they briefed him, and it became a public that they had briefed him both as unverified oppo research that the Kremlin allegedly put together on him. On Friday, Mr. Trump sent these tweets, ""Probably released by ‘intelligence’,"" intelligence in quotes, ""even knowing there is no proof, and never will be.""

Does the president-elect really believe that the intelligence community is trying to undercut him and does he stand by his comparison of those tactics to Nazi Germany?

PENCE: Well, I think -- and obviously, the briefing that the president-elect and I received a week ago was a classified briefing and I can't comment on anything that happened there.

WALLACE: Well, the intelligence community has --

PENCE: I never will. But --

WALLACE: They have verified that they did brief him on this oppo research.

PENCE: But the very fact that a few organizations, not this one, trafficked in opposition research and this salacious garbage I think was deeply troubling to millions of Americans, and from --

WALLACE: What about the intelligence community?

PENCE: -- from whatever the source, and we don't know what the source was that put this into the traffic. I know that the Director of National Intelligence said that it had been -- this information had been his floating around for months.

It -- I think the president-elect and I, it was an act of your responsibility by a handful of news organizations to actually traffic in and pay attention to these materials. And again, I think the American people saw for what it was, and our focus is going forward. When you see the team that the president-elect has assembled in the course of this transition, particularly when it comes to national security, in General Mattis and in Senator Dan Coats, and in Mike Pompeo, you're going to see an effort to reinvigorate our national security, national intelligence, and the president is going to see to that from day one.

WALLACE: Let's talk about policy going forward, because the president-elect's seemed to suggest in an interview this weekend with The Wall Street Journal that he might dramatically change relations with Russia, and in fact lift sanctions against Russia if they begin to cooperate with us on ISIS and other areas. I want to put a quote from that interview.

Mr. Trump said, ""If you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody’s doing some really great things?""

How quickly might he end sanctions on Russia?

PENCE: I think -- I think the president-elect has made it very clear that we have a terrible relationship with Russia right now, and that's not all our own doing, but it really is a failure of American diplomacy in successive administrations. And what the president-elect is determined to do is explore the possibility of better relations. We have a common enemy in ISIS, the ability to work with Russia to confront, hunt down, and destroy ISIS at its source represents an enormously important priority of this incoming administration.

But I think what the American people like about Donald Trump is he someone who can sit down, roll the sleeves up, and make a deal. And I think what you're hearing in his reflections, whether it’d be with Russia, whether it’d be with China, whether it’d be with other countries in the world is that we are going to reengage. We are going to put America first. We’re going to put America’s interest first. But we’re going to reengage in a way that advances America’s interest in the world and advances peace.

WALLACE: I want to ask you about two very specific questions briefly so we can move on to domestic policy. We now know that the Trump’s national security advisor, Mike Flynn, had several conversations with the Russian ambassador, Kislyak, just at the time that President Obama was announcing new sanctions to the hacking of the U.S. election against Russia.

Number one: did Mike Flynn ever discuss lifting sanctions in any of those conversations? Do you know?

PENCE: I talked to General Flynn yesterday, and the conversations that took place at that time were not in any way related to the new U.S. sanctions against Russia or the expulsion of diplomats.

WALLACE: All right.

Second question: can you flatly deny -- because this continues to be out there -- that there were any contact at any point in the campaign between Mr. Trump's associates and Russian operatives, including cutouts, as we know, about the hacking of the Democrats during the election?

PENCE: This -- you know, some of this derives from this opposition research memo, I guess, Chris, that made its way around the Internet. There was about 24 hours were Michael Cohen, who has worked in the Trump Organization for many years, was accused for having a meeting in Prague, and finally, some news organizations did a little checking and found out that it was a different Michael Cohen. And Michael himself has never actually been to Prague.

WALLACE: But I do want to ask you a question.

PENCE: He was at a baseball game with his son in August of last year. So --

WALLACE: I understand that. But there’s been other talk, and in fact, if I may, senators specifically asked FBI Director Comey about that. He refused to answer.

So, I’m asking a direct question: was there any contact in any way between Trump or his associates and the Kremlin or cutouts they had?

PENCE: I joined this campaign in the summer, and I can tell you that all the contact by the Trump campaign and associates was with the American people. We were fully engaged with taking his message to make America great again all across this country. That’s why he won in a landslide election.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: -- if there were any contacts, sir, I’m just trying to get an answer.

PENCE: Yes. I -- of course not. Why would there be any contacts between the campaign?

Chris, the -- this is all a distraction, and it's all part of a narrative to delegitimize the election and to question the legitimacy of this presidency, the American people see right through it.

WALLACE: OK.

PENCE: And truthfully, this is a week -- you know, I just sat on with our transition team in Washington yesterday, we have -- we've named 20 out of 21 of our candidate officials, probably have all of them named before we get to inauguration day. The caliber and character of men and women that the president-elect has assembled, the hundreds and hundreds of interviews and conversations he himself has had, I think should be deeply inspiring to millions of Americans. And they know when he raises his right hand on that inaugural platform this coming Friday, that he is going to be ready on day one to keep his promises to the American people to turn this country around.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: But let me ask you about this. We’ve got about three minutes and I’m going to ask you three questions. So, let's try to get them all in, OK?

PENCE: OK.

WALLACE: In a lightning round.

Obamacare.

PENCE: Yes.

WALLACE: The president-elect he wants to see repeal and replace basically at the same time. Here he is in his press conference.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: It will be repealed and replaced. It will be essentially simultaneously. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: I don't have to tell you that replacing is a lot more complicated than repealed, especially how do you pay for some of the provisions of Obamacare you want to keep, like the pre-existing conditions? Can you really do the really two at the same time, and when will that be? How quickly?

PENCE: The short answer is yes. We can do it at the same time.

WALLACE: Repeal and replace?

PENCE: The president-elect made it very clear to leaders in the Congress this week that he wanted to do both at the same time. And we’re very grateful the House and Senate moved resolutions this week to begin the process of repealing ObamaCare.

WALLACE: So, realistically, when could you do that, sir?

PENCE: Lifting the enormous burden -- you are seeing an incredible increase in premiums on Americans. ObamaCare has failed. We are going to repeal it.

But at the same time, we’re going to pass the kind of legislation that will lower the cost of health encourage without growing the size of debt. I would anticipate in the first 100 days that we’ll deliver on that promise for the American people.

WALLACE: Does Mr. Trump still have confidence in FBI director -- did he ever have confidence in FBI Director James Comey?

PENCE: Well, you will have to ask him about that. I know it's been the subject of some commentary this week.

But, you know, at the end of the day, I know that whether it's our security at home or abroad, the president-elect is going to put the safety and security of the American people first in every decision.

WALLACE: You’re not willing to give him a vote of confidence at this point?

PENCE: Well, you’d have to ask the president-elect. I know they’ve had conversations. And that will be a good question for him after January 20th, Chris.

WALLACE: And finally, one minute left -- central message, central theme that President Trump wants to advance in his inaugural address, the message he wants to send to the American people?

PENCE: Well, I’ll let him speak for himself on Friday. I think the American people will see the same Donald Trump they saw every day of this campaign step up to that podium. He’s going to speak from his mind, he’s going to speak from his heart, and he’s going to -- he's going to lay out a vision to make America great again.

And I have to tell you, Chris, when I stand surrounded by my family and take the oath of office as vice president of the United States, all I will be thinking about is what an honor it is to stand next to a man who I know -- who I know -- can restore and revive this country, and I’ll also just be thinking as the grandson of an Irish immigrant, what a great country this is.

WALLACE: I should also point out, you’re going to be taking the oath of office on the Reagan bible, which I -- and I gather that’s the first time it will have been used since Ronald Reagan put his hand on the Bible back in the '80s. I know how much you revere Ronald Reagan. That’s going to be a pretty emotional moment.

PENCE: It will be, and to have the oath of office administered me by Justice Clarence Thomas, someone who I admire for his philosophy, for his courage on the bench in his 25th year on the Supreme Court.

Again, it's just very humbling for me. We are approaching it with prayer, but with deep, deep gratitude to the president-elect for his confidence and deep gratitude to the American people who have elected Donald Trump and elected a man who I know is going to make America great again.

WALLACE: Mr. Vice President-elect, thank you. Thank you for joining us during this very busy time. And it's always a pleasure to talk with you, sir.

PENCE: Thanks, Chris.

WALLACE: Up next, the outgoing chief of the CIA, John Brennan, on those Russian rumors, Mr. Trump’s relationship with the intel community and the hot spots he’ll face around the world.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: A look at the inaugural stage in the west front of the capitol where Donald Trump will take the oath of office on Friday.

Mr. Trump begins his presidency in an extraordinary split with the intelligence community, a split that only widened after they presented him with unsubstantiated oppo research the Kremlin allegedly compiled, a file that quickly went public.

Joining me here in Washington for an exclusive exit interview is the outgoing CIA director John Brennan.

And, Mr. Brennan, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday"".

JOHN BRENNAN, CIA DIRECTOR: Good morning, Chris.

WALLACE: President-elect Trump has made it clear, as we just discussed, that he believes the intelligence community released, put out information about this unverified dossier in order to undercut him. Here's what he said at his press conference.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: I think it was disgraceful, disgraceful, that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out be so false and fake out. I think it's a disgrace, and I say that and I say that, and that something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Mr. Brennan, your response.

JOHN BRENNAN, CIA DIRECTOR: Well, I think as the Director of National Intelligence said in his statement, this information has been out there circulating for many months. So, it's not a question of the intelligence community leaking or releasing this information, it was already out there.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: But it hasn’t been reported, though. And one of the reasons it hadn’t is because it hadn't been verified. And when you briefed the president on it, you collectively briefed the president on it, the president-elect, that made it news.

BRENNAN: Well, nothing has been verified. It is unsubstantiated reporting that is out there, that has been circulating in the private sector and with the media as well by a firm that pulled this information together.

But what I do find outrageous is equating the intelligence community with Nazi Germany. I do take great umbrage at that, and there is no basis for Mr. Trump to point fingers at the intelligence community for leaking information that was already available publicly.

WALLACE: But it wasn't available publicly. Various news organizations, if I may, various news organization had it, but they weren't reporting it because it hadn't been verified. And this brings me to the real question, Director Brennan, why on earth within nations intelligence spy chief's brief President-elect Trump in your first meeting collectively with him on this unverified information? First of all, it wasn't intelligence, it was rumors. And secondly, my briefing him on it, you made it a news event and, therefore, gave news organizations an excuse to report it.

BRENNAN: Well, I think news organizations should not assume what happened during that discussion with Mr. Trump.

WALLACE: Well, it's been verified by the Director of National Intelligence that he was briefed on this information.

BRENNAN: Chris, bringing to the attention of the president-elect, as well as to the current president that this was circulating out there was a responsibility in the minds of the intelligence directors, of the intelligence community to make sure that there was going to be no evaluation of it, but just making sure that the president-elect was aware that it was circulating.

WALLACE: But shouldn’t you have done it a bunch of better ways, for instance, had a staff level person, give it to a staff level person, rather than the spy chiefs giving it to the president and the president-elect?

BRENNAN: Well, I think anybody who has read the reports that are out there, I think there are some very salacious allegations in there, again, unsubstantiated, that were circulating. And so, making sure that the president-elect himself was aware of it. I think that was the extent of what it was that the intelligence chiefs wanted to do.

WALLACE: One of the questions, though, is whether the intelligence community is going after -- or somehow is going to try to undercut by selective leaks the new president-elect.

Let me ask my question, because former top intelligence officials have been bashing Mr. Trump for months, and I want to put a couple of these on the screen. Former acting CIA Director Mike Morell wrote, ""In the intelligence business, we would say Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian federation.""

And then, former CIA Director Michael Hayden said he’d prefer a different term, ""That's the useful fool, some naif, manipulated by Moscow, secretly held in contempt, but his blind support is happily accepted and exploited.""

Can you understand given that and given all these leaks that have been coming out for months, why the president-elect with think the intelligence community had it in for him?

BRENNAN: Well, these are private citizens now for speaking about the current political environment about individuals. So, I’m not going to try to defend or explain what they said. But I can tell you that the intelligence community is prepared to support the president-elect and his incoming team, as we have done throughout the course of our history.

So, there is no interest in undermining the president-elect and the national security team that’s coming in. It's our responsibility to make sure that they understand exactly the dangers that are on the world stage, so that as they can decide on which policy courses they want to pursue, they have both the full benefit of the expertise, the capability, the experience and the intelligence that we have so that they can make the best decisions for this country.

WALLACE: You said you were offended, and understandably so, by his comparison to Nazi Germany. What's the danger when a president-elect and an intelligence community are at such odds and such -- at least on the part apparently of the president-elect -- such distrust?

BRENNAN: Well, there are many dangers. I think the world is watching now what Mr. Trump says, and listening very carefully. If he doesn't have confidence in the intelligence community, what signal does that send to our partners and allies, as well as our adversaries?

So, I think Mr. Trump has to be very disciplined in terms of what it is that he says publicly, he is going to be in a few days' time, the most powerful person in the world in terms of sitting on top of the United States government and I think he has to recognize that his words do have impact. And they can have very positive impact, or they can be undercutting of our national security.

WALLACE: I want to end this part of the interview with one more question, which is the same question of the device president-elect fence. Does the intelligence community have any information -- I’m not talking about rumors, any information -- about contacts between the Trump camp and associates of the Kremlin about discussions during the campaign about hacking the Democrats?

BRENNAN: The intelligence community collects foreign intelligence on foreign parties, entities or people. If in the course of our intelligence collection, we pick up information related to U.S. persons or officials, which we refer to as incidental collection, we share that information with the appropriate authorities. In most instances, that’s the FBI.

And so, if we did come into contact with that type of information, it would have been shared with the FBI, and we would make sure that our intelligence committees then were aware of it as well.

WALLACE: So, is there such information?

BRENNAN: I’d just say, if we came into -- if had that type of information, we would share it with the FBI.

WALLACE: I mean, I just would say, that's not a denial, sir.

BRENNAN: Well, I wouldn't confirm or deny something like that on your program, as much as I respect you, Chris.

WALLACE: Thank you, sir.

Let's talk about some hot spots. Mr. Trump said in this weekend, as we just talked about it in that Wall Street Journal interview, that he might lift sanctions on Russia if they start helping us. And here’s what the president-elect said about relations with the Kremlin in his news conference. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks? That's called an asset, not a liability.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Do you think that Mr. Trump understands the threat from Russia?

BRENNAN: I don't think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia's intentions, and actions that they are undertaking in many parts of the world. And that's with the obligation and responsibility of the intelligence community is.

I very much hope that our relationship with Russia improves in the coming administration -- absolutely -- because there are very important things we need to do, not just on counterterrorism, but trying to deal with political instability around the globe. But here is a fair amount of responsibility on Russia's part to change their behavior, change their actions. And what we need to do is make sure that Mr. Trump and vice president-elect. Mr. Pence, understand exactly what it is that we know, what we have intelligence about, so that when they make those decisions, it will be -- they will be informed decisions.

WALLACE: Are you concerned when you hear Mr. Trump in that interview with ""The Wall Street Journal"" already talking about a situation where he might lift sanctions?

BRENNAN: I think he has to be mindful that he does not yet have a full appreciation and understanding of what the implications are of going down that road, as well as making sure he understands what he's doing.

WALLACE: What are the implications of going down that road?

BRENNAN: Well, when you look at what's happening in Ukraine, and what’s going on in Syria, and what is happening in the cyber realm, I think Mr. Trump has to understand that absolving Russia of the various actions that it's taken in the past number of years is a road that he I think needs to be very, very careful about moving down (ph).

WALLACE: From your vantage point at Langley, as director of the CIA, what's the most immediate and pressing crisis? Foreign policy, national security crisis that Mr. Trump will face?

BRENNAN: The problem is, the challenges that he is going to face numerous ones immediately. You have the problems of terrorism, clearly, the cyber challenge that we just are talking about in terms of elections and other types of cyber capabilities that other countries have.

North Korea, increasing development of its nuclear and ballistic missile capability, instability that has wracked the Middle East. There are so many issues that the new administration is going to have responsibility for on day one, and that’s why we’re trying to make sure that he and his team are fully briefed on all of these issues.

WALLACE: As you have heard, and I don't know if you’re able to say this, but you're five days from leaving office. What do you think of his plan, of his prescriptions, what he saying about these various trouble spots, crises, challenges around the world?

BRENNAN: Well, what I think Mr. Trump has to understand is that this is more than being about him and it's about the United States and our national security. And he has to make sure that now he's going to have the opportunity to do something for national security, as opposed to talking and tweeting, he's going to have tremendous responsibility to make sure that U.S. national security interests are protected and are advanced.

And so, I am very much hoping that he has some very good people that he has pulled together, Jim Mattis, Mike Pompeo, John Kelly, and others. I think they are the ones that are going to be able to give him some wise counsel about what he needs to do and not be very spontaneous in his words and his actions. Spontaneity is not something that protects national security interests. And so, therefore, when he speaks, when he reacts, just to make sure he understands that the implications and impact on the United States could be profound. Again, it's more than just about Mr. Trump, and it's about the United States of America.

WALLACE: Finally, you are ending eight years of service as one of President Obama's top national security advisors, both in the White House and then also as CIA director. What – looking back on these eight years, what is your greatest source of pride and what is your biggest regret?

BRENNAN: First, source of pride being part of an administration – part of an administration that really has tried to advance the interests of peace and stability around the world at a very challenging time, bringing bin Laden to justice, being able to prevent a recurrence of an 9/11 attack here in the homeland. These were things that the administration and the government, as a whole, really did some great work.

Regrets, when I look at the situation in Syria, I think my heart and a lot of hearts bleeds over what has happened to that beautiful country. And I – I regret that we were not able to find a way to arrest the growth of violence and bloodshed there so that we could make sure that Syria is going to have a future for the – at least the next generation of Syrians. And that's the one area that I'm very – very regretful about.

WALLACE: Very briefly, in – is there a policy that you now believe with hindsight could have worked to stop the – the carnage and –and interrupted the civil war?

BRENNAN: Well, we – 20/20 hindsight is always, you know, quite clear. Looking back now over the last six years, the way some developments happened, the growth of ISIL, ISIL wasn’t – didn’t exist at the time. I think a lot of countries, including the United States, could have been more aggressive and proactive in terms of what we should have done to – to prevent the – the deterioration into so much bloodshed in Syria.

WALLACE: Director Brennan, thank you. Thank you for your time. And we want to thank you for your years of service to this country, sir.

BRENNAN: Thank you, Chris. Thank you very much.

WALLACE: Up next, we’ll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the Russian intel and this week's confirmation hearings where Mr. Trump's top cabinet picks discuss some surprising disagreements with their new boss.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Coming up, some of Donald Trump's cabinet nominees split with him on Russia.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JAMES MATTIS, DEFENSE SECRETARY NOMINEE: With Mr. Putin, we recognize that he is trying to break the North Atlantic Alliance.

MIKE POMPEO, CIA DIRECTOR NOMINEE: Russia has reasserted itself aggressively.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: We’ll ask our Sunday panel what those different opinions mean for our foreign policy next on Fox News Sunday.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: A thing like that should have never been written, it should never have been had, and it should certainly never have been released.

PELOSI: I always wondered, what did Russia have on Donald Trump?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Mr. Trump and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi reacting very differently to that unverified Russian dossier that supposedly has compromising information on the new president.

And it's time now for our Sunday group. Gerald Seib, executive Washington editor of The Wall Street Journal, Bob Woodward from The Washington Post, former Democratic Congresswoman Jane Harman, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center, and Washington Examiner contributor Lisa Boothe.

Well, Bob, what do you think – and this is something we discussed with both of our guests – of the way that the intelligence community handled the so-called Russian dossier? And, overall, how do you think of the way they’ve handle Donald Trump?

BOB WOODWARD, THE WASHINGTON POST: I think what’s underreported here is Trump's point of view on it. And you laid it out when those former CIA people said these things about Trump, that he was a recruited, you know, agent of the Russians.

WALLACE: Useful fool.

WOODWARD: Yes, and a useful fool. I mean they started this. And in Trump's mind, he knows the old adage, once a CIA man, always a CIA man. And no one came out and said those people shouldn't be saying things. So then act two is the briefing when this dossier is put out. I – I've lived in this world for 45 years where you get things and people make allegations. That is a garbage document. It never should have been presented in – as part of an intelligence briefing. As you suggested, other channels have the White House Counsel give it to Trump's incoming White House counsel.

So Trump's right to be upset about that. And I think if you look at the real chronology and the nature of the battle here, those intelligence chiefs who were the best we’ve had, who were terrific and have done great work made a mistake here. And when people make mistakes, they should apologize.

WALLACE: Well, let me bring in the former top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Congresswoman Harman.

Yo know, there is this sense that – that – that an awful lot of information that the intelligence community developed about Russia hacking, the garbage dossier, new phrase, that it got public. And – and can't you understand how Donald Trump would end up feeling like these guys are trying to knife them?

JANE HARMAN, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN, D-CALI: Yes, I can understand that. But from the other side, I can understand that very careful and highly trained intelligence professionals think they’re being dissed. John Brennen just said that in hindsight he might have done some things differently. I agree with Bob, there was another way to handle that salacious two page unsubstantiated dossier. But I think the intelligence community seriously has put out its case starting in early October when Jeh Johnson and I think it was Mike Rogers put out the case that there was Russian hacking.

And I think it's important for Donald Trump and his good cabinet picks, Dan Coats and – and Mike Pompeo, to end this war, for two reasons. Number one, we need –

WALLACE: The war – the war, we should say, with the intelligence community.

HARMAN: Yes, yes, the war with the intelligence community, for two reasons. Number one, we need these guys. They’re on the front lines now in undisclosed locations. My – I have visited them all over the world. They’re fabulous. We need them. We need truth to power. But the second reason is, we need our allies to have confidence in the Trump intelligence relationship and not think that if they share information with us, which is crucial for us understanding threats to the United States, it won’t be compromised in some way.

WALLACE: All right, I want to change dramatically.

Gerry, you were one of the two reporters for The Wall Street Journal that conducted that interview over the weekend with President-elect Trump. How dramatically does it seem to you he wants to reshape our relations both with Russia and China?

GERALD F. SEIB, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, that's not clear, but what is clear is that the mindset is totally different. This is a -- everything is open for negotiation kind of an approach to the two biggest countries outside the U.S. in the world. The two most important, Russia and China. And he literally said with China, everything is open to negotiation, including the One-China policy. This was the policy by which the U.S. has for years and years recognized Beijing as the one and only true representative government of the people of China, not Taiwan.

And on Russia sanctions, he said, I’ll keep the sanctions in place for a while, but we’ll see how the Russians behave. And it's very much a transactional kind of an approach to foreign policy. You’re nice to us, we’ll find ways to be nice to you, and vice versa. And it's going to be different. I mean people will argue the wisdom of it, but the one thing that's clear is that the mindset going in is going to be different.

WALLACE: The Senate started holding confirmation hearings for Trump’s cabinet picks this week, and one of the things that everyone noticed is the sharp differences between the nominees and Mr. Trump. Let's put some of them up on the screen.

There were real differences over the threats posed by Russia, waterboarding, building a wall, and tearing up the Iran nuclear deal with.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.

GEN. JAMES MATTIS, DEFENSE SECRETARY NOMINEE: It is an imperfect arms control agreement. It's not a friendship treaty. But when America gives her word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Lisa, are we headed for a constructive debate, divergent opinions in the Trump cabinet, or we headed for chaos?

LISA BOOTHE, WASHINGTON EXAMINER CONTRIBUTOR: I think we are. I mean, look, Donald Trump came –

WALLACE: Well, which one?

BOOTHE: Good point. No, I think it’s going to be constructive, so to answer that for clarity sake. But, you know, look, I mean Donald Trump can't win here because he got a lot of criticism during the general election that he wouldn’t take the advice of counsel, that he wouldn’t take the advice of his advisor, but he has surrounded himself with some very smart and capable people, as the CIA director pointed out in his interview with you as far as General Mattis goes. And I think he’ll have a lot more faith in the intelligence community when he does have some people there that he trusts, like someone like Mike Pompeo.

In regards to Russia as well, I think the biggest problem here is the distrust, the erosion of trust in – in just institutions at large when you have the fact that the media reported something that The New York Times said was very difficult to check. And even what could – can be checked is problematic when the fact that you have sitting members of Congress saying that they're not going to recognize President-elect Trump as the president because he is illegitimate. When you have individuals that are calling for the abolishment of the Electoral College and we’re calling for electors to defect. So I think the biggest problem that we are dealing with right now is the erosion of trust in all of the institutions, whether it's the intelligence community, the media, and the government at large.

WALLACE: All right. We’re going to take a break here.

And it certainly is worth noting, I think that Barack Obama came into office on the same week with a – an approval rating in the 60s and Donald Trump’s approval rating is in the 40s. So there is – everybody’s at logger heads here in Washington.

All right, we’ll be back in a second.

When we come back, an inspector general announces he’ll investigate possible misconduct in the way FBI Director James Comey handled the Clinton e-mail investigation.

Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the IG probe? Just go to Facebook or Twitter @foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: There is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.

ROBBY MOOK, FORMER CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER: If he has acted improperly and that the American people can no longer have faith in his ability to carry out justice, I think at that point someone should step down.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Hillary Clinton's former campaign manager questioning whether FBI Director James Comey violated FBI regulations in being so public about the Clinton e-mail investigation. This after the Justice Department’s inspector general announced he’ll review Comey's actions.

And we’re back now with the panel.

Well, Bob, as someone who’s had a lot of dealings with the FBI over the last 40, 45 years, did Comey violate FBI regulations in going so public, and, frankly, should he step down?

WOODWARD: Well, I mean, he's got almost no friends right now. Lots of people are calling for his head. I – I – I wouldn't anticipate learning too much from this inspector general's investigation. He can't compel people to talk. And they’ll say, oh, yes, that’s confidential or that’s connected to something classified.

I – I think Trump and his people, having done reporting on this, have a lot of respect for Comey on the issue of counterterrorism. The FBI has done a spectacular job in preventing the mass casualty attacks in this country, which were much anticipated after 9/11. So that – it – it may hang on that.

WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and we got a bunch like this one from Lillian Murphy on Twitter. ""I want to know why the IG is not questioning the tarmac meeting between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Lynch.""

Lisa, how do you answer Lillian?

BOOTHE: I certainly agree. I think that should be under investigation. I'm glad to find as well that they will be looking at the FBI Andrew McCabe whose wife was a recipient of money from one of the FBI individuals, from Terry McAuliffe, who’s closely connected to the Clinton campaign.

BLITZER: Who was the governor of Virginia and gave a lot of money to this – wife of the – who – she was running for office.

BOOTHE: Governor of Virginia. Exactly. And I think FBI Director Comey was set up to fail with all of this because any decision he had made from the start would have been met with extreme criticism. If he had recommended an indictment against Hillary Clinton, can you imagine how that would have gone over in this country? And, of course, Loretta Lynch tied his hands by setting out – or by meeting with President Bill Clinton on the tarmac of that plane. And I think this is a continued scapegoating from the left. And if they want to look for reasons why Hillary Clinton lost, look no further than the fact that they elected someone who was under investigation by the FBI to begin with, or the fact that she spent more money seeing one electoral vote in Omaha, Nebraska, on TV, than Michigan and Wisconsin combined.

WALLACE: Almost lost in all of the talk about Russia and the FBI this week is the fact that Donald Trump finally announced what his plan is to separate himself from the Trump businesses. But the head of the Office of Government Ethics immediately dismissed it. Here he is.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

WALTER SHAUB, JR., DIRECTOR, U.S. OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS: The plan the president has announced doesn't meet the standards that the best of his nominees are meeting, and that every president in the past four decades has met.

(END VIDEO CLIP)



WALLACE: Congresswoman Harman, the Trumps do business around the world and – which raises the question, every time that he makes a decision, or his administration makes a decision about policy in one of those countries, does it raise the – the likelihood that people are going to say, well, that’s to advance his business interests?

HARMAN: Well, I think he wants his issue to be over. And in this town, appearance and reality are conflated. And I think he could do more – I’m sure Gerry has some specific ideas – to stop this story.

I just want to say a couple words about Comey. He certainly had my admiration for intervening in – in former Attorney General Ashcroft’s hospital room to block a Bush administration effort to ratify or renew some surveillance standards against the standard legal procedure. But in this case, the – his actions this last year to me are inexplicable. Attorneys general are – or inspector general, are supposed to be independent. This guy maybe should investigate other actions of the Justice Department. But I think he’s within bounds to want to investigate this. And this guy, we just checked it, could be replaced by Donald Trump if he chooses to replace him, Comey, although he serves a 10 year term –

WALLACE: Right. So – so should – should –

HARMAN: As Bill Clinton replaced the then FBI director, Bill Sessions.

WALLACE: Very quickly, should Comey step down?

HARMAN: I think that’s Comey’s call. Should – I – and I – I don't pretend to make recommendations to Donald Trump.

WALLACE: OK. All right.

Well you shifted the question about the businesses.

Gerry, what to think of this? I mean is this going to – you said – I think Congresswoman Harman’s exactly right, he wanted to end the controversy. Has he?

SEIB: No, absolutely. This is going to be a continuing feature. There’s no way around this. Look, the issue here is that Donald Trump says, I’ve set up a trust. My sons are going to run the business. They’re in charge of it. But the critics say it's not a blind trust. If you sons are running the business, you’re not blind to that by any means.

The Trump response to that is, these aren't liquid access. I’m not a guy who has a -- $100 million in stock. I own buildings and a brand. And you can't just sell that. If you sell all those things, it's a fire sale, the value that I’ve built up goes out the window automatically. That is the tension in this question. And it's not going to go away. And I think they realize it’s not going to go away. They’re going to live with it and everybody in town is going to have to question – deal with questions we haven’t had to deal with before.

WALLACE: Is there something reasonably that he could have done? I mean as – as – as somebody pointed out, he can't un-know the fact that he owns the Trump Tower or that, you know, un-know whether it – it still is in his property – his portfolio or not. What could he reasonably have done?

SEIB: I think he could have legally separated himself from the Trump Organization more than he has. But he hasn’t done that, and so we’re – as I said, we’re going to have to deal with that.

I think the other option would have been to take his family entirely out of the ownership and leadership of the – of the company, but that wasn't going to happen. This is the Trump family, and so they weren't going to go there.

WALLACE: And I kind of wonder when he says he's not going to talk to his sons about the business, I’m thinking, boy, that’s going to be an awkward holiday, huh? So, how – how about them Redskins?

SEIB: Yes. Well, you –

WOODWARD: Every time the Trump Organization make some deal in – in the Middle East, then people are going to be asking him, have you talked to your sons about this? How does he –

WALLACE: Well – well, in fairness he has said – he’s said there are not going to be any new deals with foreign countries. But, you know what?

WOODWARD: Yes.

WALLACE: We've got to end.

Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. To be continued.

Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week."" The man Donald Trump picked to run his inauguration gives us a surprising preview.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: A look at the National Building Museum, site of the salute to our Armed Services Inaugural Ball this Friday.

Whether you like him or not, Donald Trump always likes to do things big, but it turns out that's not how he wants his inauguration. Here’s our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

TOM BARRACK, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURAL COMMITTEE: We need to thank the people who were faithful to us, we need to encourage those who weren’t, but do it simply, do it quickly, do it elegantly, and let's get back to work.

Where is the stage?

WALLACE (voice-over): Tom Barrack is chairman of the Presidential Inaugural Committee, in charge of organizing 19 events over six days. And he says Donald Trump's marching orders may surprise some people.

BARRACK: In its simplicity, the idea is to organize what's already here and available, rather than focusing on a coronation of the man.

WALLACE (on camera): Are you saying that Donald Trump wanted to deemphasize the celebration of his victory?

BARRACK: He wanted to deemphasize at the celebration of him.

WALLACE (voice-over): But even a simple inauguration is a big deal. Barrack has a staff of 360, backed by a security force of 35,000, handling events for as many as 750,000 people. He's running everything, except the swearing in ceremony.

BARRACK: It comes together just for that moment, to allow that peaceful transition of power. But it's – it’s – it’s quite an ordeal. It’s putting on the Olympics in 60 days.

TRUMP: We’re going to have a very, very elegant day. The 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special.

WALLACE (on camera): Donald Trump is a pretty good producer. How involved, how micro-managing has he been about this?

BARRACK: He makes me crazy. I had blonde hair and blue eyes when this started. He wants to know the color of the napkins, where’s the linen, how many people are coming, what’s the play list.

WALLACE: Are you being serious?

BARRACK: Yes. And I said, would – could you go back and just manage the free world and leave me alone?

WALLACE (voice-over): One of the president-elect's ideas, do what Andrew Jackson did in the 1820s, open the White House to the public.

BARRACK: Of course I had no idea what Andrew Jackson did. I went back and researched it and said, by the way, they absolutely –

WALLACE (on camera): Trashed the place.

BARRACK: Trashed the place. So this – it – it –

WALLACE: It's not a good idea.

BARRACK: It’s not a great idea.

WALLACE (voice-over): But other ideas are going better.

Where Barack Obama had ten inaugural balls in 2009, Mr. Trump said he only wanted three.

BARRACK: It’s not appropriate after what we went through. We need a more healing kind of an inauguration. We don't need a celebration of me, the victor.

WALLACE: Of course there will be protests, but Barrack says as long as they’re not violent, that's fine.

BARRACK: Us remembering the dialogue is alive is a good thing, not a bad thing. And – and that comes from the president himself. So it’s – it’s people getting hurt that’s the issue, not – not protest.

WALLACE: Barrack and Trump have been close for more than 30 years. Barrack runs a private equity real estate firm with $58 billion in assets, but they've always known where to draw the line.

BARRACK: He’s one of my best friends. And – and the reason I'm not going into the administration is I intend to keep it that way.

WALLACE: Still, Barrack is ready to defend his buddy.

BARRACK: What I tell everybody is, give him a chance. He's not even president yet.

WALLACE: But first things first, there's an inauguration to put on.

WALLACE (on camera): What’s the weather forecast, which is the all-important thing, for Friday, January 20th?

BARRACK: Forty-six degrees and sunny.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: And the forecast continues to be good weather on Friday.

Be sure to tune to this Fox station for coverage of the inauguration anchored by Shepard Smith, or all day on Fox News Channel where I’ll join Bret Baier and Martha McCallum on the National Mall.

And that's it for today. Have a great week. And we’ll see you next ""Fox News Sunday.""

The president had initially offered praise for Donald Trump Jr., issuing a statement through a spokesperson saying his son was a “high-quality person” and applauding his “transparency” after Trump Jr. released a June 2016 email chain that spelled out an offer to give the Trump administration incriminating information on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as part of Russia’s ""support for Mr. Trump.”

But on Wednesday President Trump was the defiant tweeter-in-chief, taking to social media to support his son after a Tuesday night appearance on Fox News' ""Hannity.""

“My son Donald did a good job last night. He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!” Trump wrote.

He added: “Remember, when you hear the words ‘sources say’ from the Fake Media, often times those sources are made up and do not exist.”

The Trump administration’s agenda has been stalled in part by persistent media questions and a plethora of Congressional committees and Federal agencies investigating alleged collusion by Team Trump with the alleged Russian plot to meddle in the 2016 presidential election.

While many of the stories have relied on murky anonymous sourcing – perhaps accounting for Trump’s second tweet – Tuesday’s Trump Jr. stories were largely predicated on the email exchange between Trump Jr. and Russian publicist Rob Goldstone – a conversation later shown to be accurate when Trump Jr. himself tweeted the email chain in light of its pending publication by The New York Times."

In a prepared statement to the committees obtained by Fox News, Kushner laid out his dealings with foreign leaders and said none constitute campaign collusion.

“I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government,” reads a section of his statement. “I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector. I have tried to be fully transparent with regard to the filing of my SF-86 form [security clearance], above and beyond what is required. Hopefully, this puts these matters to rest.”

Kushner detailed four contacts he had with Russians during the presidential campaign and transition.

“Reviewing emails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time ..."" — Jared Kushner

“With respect to my contacts with Russia or Russian representatives during the campaign, there were hardly any,” he said in the statement, before recalling when he was at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington in April 2016, when his father-in-law delivered a speech on foreign policy and he was introduced to four ambassadors at the event, which included then Russian ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak.

“With all the ambassadors, including Mr. Kislyak, we shook hands, exchanged brief pleasantries and I thanked them for attending the event and said I hoped they would like candidate Trump’s speech and his ideas for a fresh approach to America’s foreign policy,” Kushner recalled. “The ambassadors also expressed interest in creating a positive relationship should we win the election. Each exchange lasted less than a minute; some gave me their business cards and invited me to lunch at their embassies. I never took them up on any of these invitations and that was the extent of the interactions.”

Kushner denied reports he took two calls with Kislyak between April and November 2016.

“I had no ongoing relationship with the ambassador before the election, and had limited knowledge about him then. In fact, on Nov. 9, the day after the election, I could not even remember the name of the Russian ambassador,” he said.

In the statement, Kushner detailed the June 2016 meeting with a Russian-American lawyer, news of which emerged ealier this month and gave new momentum to Democrat claims the Trump administration secretly worted with the Kremlin to game the election.

“I arrived at the meeting a little late. When I got there, the person who has since been identified as a Russian attorney was talking about the issue of a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children. I had no idea why that topic was being raised and quickly determined that my time was not well-spent at this meeting,” he recalls in the statement. “Reviewing emails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time and that, in looking for a polite way to leave and get back to my work, I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for ten or so minutes and wrote ""Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting.""

“I had not met the attorney before the meeting nor spoken with her since. I thought nothing more of this short meeting until it came to my attention recently.”

Emails released this month show Donald Trump Jr. accepted the meeting at Trump Tower with the idea that he would receive damaging information about Hillary Clinton. But Kushner says he hadn't seen those emails until he was recently shown them by his lawyers. Kushner says in his statement that Trump Jr. invited him to the meeting.

The release of the statement comes just hours before he is to be interviewed by a Senate committee investigating Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and any possible collusion by Trump associates.

The interview with the Senate intelligence committee will be behind closed doors.

Committee chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and ranking member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Tuesday the subpoena had been withdrawn after Manafort began the process of handing over documents to the committee and ""committed to negotiating in good faith a date for a future interview.""

Feinstein told Fox News that neither Manafort nor Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son, would appear before the committee Wednesday -- but ""hopefully"" both will appear in September.

""The staffs are negotiating and it just got too close,"" Feinstein said, ""and members need to prepare and they need to get documents to be able to prepare, so that's what we've set upon now.""

Manafort had been subpoenaed late Monday to testify at Wednesday's hearing, which is part of the ongoing congressional investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign officials in the 2016 presidential election.

Lawmakers were expected to ask Manafort and Trump Jr. about their June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and her associates. Emails posted by Trump Jr. on Twitter earlier this month suggested he took the meeting with the expectation of receiving damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

Manafort met Tuesday with the staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into Russian actions during last year's campaign.

Last Friday, the Judiciary Committee also subpoenaed Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the research firm that allegedly hired a British intelligence officer to compile a dossier of allegations involving Trump and his ties to Russia. However, Simpson has since agreed to a transcribed interview and will not testify in public.

Veselnitskaya is the attorney thought to have damaging information on Hillary Clinton who met with Donald Trump Jr. in June 2016.

Krauthammer said the real ""scandal"" is that Trump Jr. - through an intermediary - arranged a meeting with a Russian government lawyer in order to get dirt on Clinton.

He said it does, however, undermine the White House's narrative that there wasn't any collusion with Russia.

He Is The Author Of The No. New York Times Best-Selling Book']",FOX News,"What Jared Kushner did is neither improper nor different than what other incoming presidential administrations have done. It certainly does not constitute a crime.

After the election and before President Trump took office, Kushner received over 50 contacts with people from more than 15 countries while he was acting on behalf of the president-elect. Previous entering presidents and their transition teams have engaged in similar contacts and conversations.

According to Kushner’s public statement, he met with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, to discuss improved relations and “to address U.S. policy in Syria.” Later, Kushner met with a Russian banker, Sergey Gorkov, “who could give insight into how President Putin was viewing the new administration and best ways to work together.” Exactly how are those meetings counterproductive, uncommon or illegal? They are not.

I spoke with Professor W. David Clinton, Chairman of the Political Science Department at Baylor University, who co-authored the seminal book, ""Presidential Transitions and American Foreign Policy."" Having read Kushner’s statement, the professor remarked that he found nothing wrong with these meetings. He pointed out that it is the very same practice employed by other presidential transitions:

“It is common for representatives of other governments to get in touch with the incoming presidential administration to begin informal relationships and address relevant issues. It is not unusual. Transitions are fairly long. The incoming administration needs to inform itself of foreign policy. Getting to know people and foreign governments is widely done and beneficial to the U.S.”

Accusations that Kushner violated the Logan Act are without merit. The act prohibits private citizens from interfering in diplomatic disputes with foreign governments. If Kushner’s statement is true, then he did nothing of the sort.

Having a discussion about improved diplomatic relations, or how to better handle the conflict and humanitarian crisis in Syria, does not violate the Logan Act. Passed in 1799, no one has ever been convicted under the Act – largely because it is regarded as an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment.

Kushner was not acting as a private citizen, as the law defines it. He was acting in a wholly different capacity – as a government representative of a president about to assume office. Moreover, he was not interfering in a diplomatic dispute.

Just the opposite. He was preparing the incoming administration for the foreign policy challenges that lay ahead and establishing the kind of vital contact that assists a new president in formulating effective relationships and policies. In other words, Kushner was doing his job. He did it in the same manner that other transition officials have done in previous administrations.

By his statement, Kushner disabused the media report that he sought some “secret back channel” to the Russian government. Russian generals apparently wanted to “provide information” on Syria that might prove helpful. An attempt, perhaps, at cooperation and future coordination as the U.S. seeks to destroy ISIS in Syria.

The Russian ambassador asked if there was a secure line in the transition office to conduct such a conversation. There wasn’t. Kushner, interested in defusing the humanitarian crisis in Syria, asked if the existing communications at the embassy could be used. It could not. End of discussion.

Secure lines are not an extraordinary means of communicating with foreign governments. Indeed, they are routine, especially when prospective military information is being shared. It is neither nefarious nor criminal.

Why did Kushner not mention these meetings when he submitted his Security Clearance Form on January 18, 2017? As he explained, his assistant mistakenly sent what was only an uncompleted draft. It omitted all foreign contacts, not just the Russian meetings. The error was noticed immediately, the transition team notified that night, and the FBI informed the next day and given supplemental information that disclosed “numerous contacts with foreign officials.”

A complete and accurate list was forthcoming which “later disclosed over one hundred contacts from more than twenty countries.” In fact, the Security Clearance form instructs that the document can be “updated and clarified” as part of the clearance process. There is no evidence Kushner tried to deliberately deceive the government.

Kushner admits he dropped in on the now-infamous meeting that Donald Trump Jr. held at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer and others during the campaign. He insists he arrived late, had no idea what the meeting was about, and left quickly when he realized the subject matter was all about the issue of the U.S. ban on Russian adoptions.

Though he heard no talk at the meeting of campaign activity, such a discussion would not have been prohibited under law, as explained in an earlier column.

Yet for months, Jared Kushner has been mugged by the media mob. His crime appears to be no crime at all. There was never an effort to place his meetings in the context of historical precedence, as Professor Clinton has done. There was no attempt at fairness or reasoned analysis.

Now, it is the media that deserves a good mugging."

The assertion came as newly revealed email correspondence further undermined previous reports that the Trump Tower meeting was set up to discuss damaging information about Clinton.

As reflected in those emails, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya told Fox News she believed the June 2016 meeting with President Trump’s eldest son was meant to discuss the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 sanctions law aimed at top Russian officials.

“I had never been looking for a meeting neither with Trump Jr., nor Sr., nor his team,” Veselnitskaya told Fox News in an email, sent in Russian and translated to English by her translator. Veselnitskaya wrote, however, that she “had been told” Trump Jr. “could help” her bring information to members of Congress about the Magnitsky Act, which Moscow adamantly opposed.

TRUMP TOWER MEETING WASN'T ABOUT CLINTON 'DIRT,' EMAILS SHOW

“If Hillary Clinton or anybody from her environment could have been such an individual [to help], I also would have passed that information [to her],” Veselnitskaya wrote.

The June 2016 meeting was first reported by The New York Times over the summer, reigniting claims that the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia in the presidential election.

Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort were known to have attended the meeting with Veselnitskaya, Russian-born lobbyist Rinat Ahkmetshin and music publicist Rob Goldstone, who brokered the get-together promising campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton.

Veselnitskaya told Fox News on Wednesday that the information being shared in the Trump Tower meeting “was not confidential,” but also “was not public.” “I wanted to make it public,” Veselnitskaya said in the email. “Because I naively thought there should be justice in the US for the fraudsters fostering hatred between the two of our countries.”

The suggestion that she would have made contact with Clinton further challenges the notion that the meeting was about anything other than sanctions.

The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on correspondence between Veselnitskaya and Goldstone, likewise suggesting the meeting was not set up to pass on damaging information about Clinton on behalf of the Russian government.

RUSSIAN ATTORNEY RIPS ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER AS 'CHEAP GOSSIP,' AMID QUESTIONS OVER ORIGIN

The emails show Veselnitskaya requesting to invite Akhmetshin to the meeting, saying he had “invaluable knowledge about the positions held by the members of the Foreign Relations Committee that will be important to our discussion,” the Wall Street Journal reported.

While Veselnitskaya -- in correspondence at the time and comments made more recently -- has countered claims that the meeting might have dealt with Clinton dirt, that narrative emerged thanks to the originally published correspondence between Trump Jr. and Goldstone.

Goldstone said at the time that he could set up a meeting to provide “very high level and sensitive information” compromising Clinton’s election chances as part of “Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”

“If it’s what you say, I love it,” Trump Jr. wrote in response.

It remains unclear what Goldstone was referring to.

Following the controversy, Trump Jr. defended himself, saying Veselnitskaya did not have any such information and wanted to focus on other non-election-related issues. She echoed his view on multiple occasions.

The emails were released by Scott Balber, an attorney for Aras Agalarov, who helped organize the meeting with Trump Jr.

Balber also told the Journal that the Russian lawyer has been fighting the Magnitsky Act for years and reached out to numerous Russian authorities.

As part of her effort against the sanctions law, Veselnitskaya reportedly had talking points that included one reference to Clinton, suggesting a U.S. company had avoided taxes in Russia and donated to the Democratic Party, possibly Clinton.

The Post story said President Trump “dictated” Donald Trump Jr.’s statement to the press regarding his controversial June 9, 2016 meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and associates.

That initial statement in June said Trump Jr. and the lawyer mostly discussed a program concerning the adoption of Russian children. It later emerged, however, that Trump Jr. had been told in advance the lawyer could have dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

Sanders on Tuesday defended Donald Trump Jr.'s initial statement as ""true"" with ""no inaccuracy.""

Further, she said the president ""did not dictate"" the words -- but acknowledged he weighed in and offered ""suggestions"" for the statement.

""The president weighed in, like any father would, based on the limited information he had,"" she said at Tuesday's briefing.

Trump’s outside legal counsel, Jay Sekulow, also said that the president’s involvement in crafting the statement was “of no consequence” and that the “characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate and not pertinent.”

Sanders rejected claims that the initial statement was misleading and sought to shift the spotlight to Democrats and the media.

“The only thing that is misleading is a year's worth of stories about Russia that have been fueling a false narrative,” she said, accusing Democrats of using the issue as a ""PR stunt"" and ""doing everything they can to keep this alive.""

Sanders, as she has before, drew attention to the Clintons' ties to Russia and suggested they should face similar scrutiny.

“If you want to talk about a relationship with Russia, look no further than the Clintons,” Sanders said, noting that former President Bill Clinton was “paid half a million dollars” for a speech in Moscow.

Sanders also slammed the company Fusion GPS for its role in creating the “phony” anti-Trump dossier, which contained crude claims that fueled the Russia-Trump controversy.

“The press is trying to create a narrative that doesn’t exist,” Sanders said.

She added, “Fusion GPS took money from the Russian government,” referring to last week’s testimony by a key witness who claimed Fusion GPS worked “on behalf of the Russian government” and Natalia Veselnitskaya on a separate front to fight U.S. sanctions that had enraged Moscow’s elite.

Bill Browder, the CEO and co-founder of Hermitage Capital, testified that Veselnitskaya orchestrated a Fusion GPS-run smear campaign against him for pushing a law that brought sanctions against Russian oligarchs suspected of money laundering called The Magnitsky Act.

Fusion GPS denied Browder’s claims and said they are “cooperating with Congress.”

The Trump White House seems to have upgraded that approach to very slowly.

Damage control is an art, and it’s one the current administration has not yet mastered. Even if you believe the whole Russia story is overblown and being pushed by a hostile media, a president and his team have to be able to minimize controversial revelations—especially when, as in the case of Donald Trump Jr., they are based on facts.

By not disclosing there was another person in the meeting between Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and Don Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, the White House allowed NBC to break the story Friday just as the uproar was starting to fade a bit. Not only did administration officials fail to get ahead of the news, they turned what could have been a two-day story into a weeklong mess.

And the fact that the other participant, Rinat Akhmetshin, is not just a Russian-American lobbyist but a former Soviet intelligence officer just makes it look like the White House had something to hide. It may or may not mean anything that, as the Daily Beast, reported, Akhmetshin was accused in a lawsuit of hacking into two computer systems of a Russian mining company. But let’s just say the appearance isn’t great.

And Akhmestshin told the AP that the Russian lawyer, Veselnitskaya, had given the Trump team a printout of questionable donations to the DNC, as opposed to offering nothing at all on the Democrats.

When Don Jr. did his interview with Sean Hannity, the Fox host asked him if he had met with any other Russians. Not “in a formalized meeting or anything like that, because why would I?” Trump said.

At another point Hannity asked, “So as far as you know, as far as this incident is concerned, this is all of it?”

“This is everything. This is everything,” the president’s son replied.

It wasn’t.

The better course, in retrospect, would have been to say by the way, there was another guy in the meeting, here is his name, I didn’t know anything about him. That would have been plugged into the stories but not left on the street like a ticking time bomb.

Keep in mind that Don Jr. originally gave the New York Times, which broke the story, a narrow statement saying the meeting was primarily about a Russian adoption program. White House officials drafted that statement, and I’m told it was over the objections of the president’s son, who wanted to provide a more detailed statement.

In the second statement, Don Jr. acknowledged that he took the meeting because he was told Veselnitskaya had opposition research on Hillary Clinton, and that this was authorized by the Russian government—but turned out to be a “pretext” to talk about U.S. sanctions that led to the elimination of the adoption program.

And the younger Trump released the emails setting up the meeting only when told that the Times was about to publish them.

The president defended his son, and the story was starting to play itself out when the latest shoe dropped.

Maybe the media, as usual, are making too much of this. Maybe there’s a gotcha element to the coverge. With some Democrats crying ""treason,"" the press is again ready to go beyond the available facts.

But it’s harder for an administration to make that case when it holds back relevant details until they dribble out in the press--as Ari Fleischer agreed on yesterday's ""Media Buzz.""

Lanny Davis, the Clinton White House lawyer who dealt with the accumulated scandals, later published a book titled “Truth to Tell: Tell It All, Tell It Early, Tell It Yourself.”

The Trump team might check it out if it wants to stop getting blindsided on this Russia story. If it’s going to leak out anyway, telling it early is the best course."

“Suddenly @CNN has a moral compass? Giving the debate questions to your preferred candidate ahead of time—is that bad for our democracy?” Eric Trump tweeted Monday morning in response to an earlier Twitter debate Acosta was having with his father.

On Sunday morning, President Trump had tweeted: “With all of its phony unnamed sources & highly slanted & even fraudulent reporting, #Fake News is DISTORTING DEMOCRACY in our country!”

An hour later, Acosta seemingly responded.

“Calling the American news media ‘fake news’ may feel good to some. It may energize the base. But it’s bad for our democracy,” Acosta tweeted Sunday morning.

President Trump tweeted something similar on Sunday morning saying, “HillaryClinton can illegally get question to the Debate & delete 30,000 emails but my son Don is being scored by the Fake News media?”

This is not the first time Acosta has been confronted by the Trumps.

On the roster: Trump tries his hand at selling insurance - Doomsday on ObamaCare cuts vote next week - Trump Jr., Manafort cleared to testify before Senate - Sessions draws heat over seizures - Rogue goat



TRUMP TRIES HIS HAND AT SELLING INSURANCE

“The Republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is,” declared the leader of the Republican Party.

Now, we understand that it is in President Trump’s personal interest to create as much distance between himself and his party as possible vis-à-vis their struggles to pass health insurance legislation. One might even say “That's politics!”

So good for him that today he opted to get in the game.

We explained Monday that it is lawmakers who deserve the preponderance of blame for the GOP quagmire on a bill that would have traded cuts to ObamaCare benefits and a regulatory rollback in exchange for providing funds to prop up the individual insurance market for 2018.

And that’s still true. Trump has no firm opinions about a health insurance law other than it be “the best,” which, as long as it is described in terms relative to other legislation, is helpfully meaningless. Lawmakers should have taken advantage of Trump’s policy vacuum and, you know, made law.

But you already know that the political failure of Republicans to have coalesced in seven years behind some kind of legislation that addresses Medicare, individual health insurance policies and industry regulations -- or even core policy principles about those topics -- is one of the most profound in memory.

Heck, that they couldn't come up with something in the three quarters of a year since the election is pretty potently puny.

But they ditched that idea in March when party leaders in Congress put forward legislation that would delay repeal of ObamaCare benefits and most regulations for two years enact an immediate reduction of the taxes in the current law. It was a punt, but aimed at the 1-yard line.

Now, having tackled their own ball carriers repeatedly for lost yardage, Republicans are trying to get the ball aloft from inside their own end zone. And the Democrats are there, manically grinning with nostrils flared like Bronko Nagurski, ready to strip the ball out of the kicker's quavering hands.

So despite the failures of the rest of the team and the coaches -- blunders that the president has so eagerly pointed out -- we would be remiss to not consider the quarterback of this hapless squad.

The WSJ/NBC News poll provides a very useful batch of data this week by looking more closely at the 439 counties in 16 states that fueled Trump's stunning 2016 victory.

While it is true that the latest Senate version of not-really-repeal-not-really-replace only drew 12 percent support from voters in these counties, the numbers that really matter are these: 47 percent of all voters and 59 percent of those who said they voted for Trump said they didn't know what to think about the bill.

It's certainly fair to call the most recently failed version of insurance legislation unpopular, especially given the degree to with voters repeatedly express deep concerns about the way Trump and Republicans are handling the issue.

But it would be more accurate to say that it died an unknown.

In an article that is certainly a sign of our times, the NYT applied some aggressive data analysis to the president’s Twitter feed and found out something that any child could see: Trump is very good at insulting people and denigrating things. He’s good not because he is creative, but because he is dogged.

“Psychologists have another term for what Mr. Trump does here that is so effective,” the Times observes. “He ‘essentializes’ [crooked Hillary Clinton] and his other opponents, like Lyin’ Ted Cruz.”

Trump has been similarly effective in branding the existing health insurance legislation as a “disaster.” He has attacked ObamaCare with the kind of zeal he usually reserves for human beings.

But when it comes to the effort to replace that law, Trump has been mostly indifferent.

As the proposal he ostensibly supported hung in the balance, Trump was tweeting up a storm about the women’s golf tournament being played at one of his courses, attacking his favorite nemesis, the press, and touting his own wonderfulness.

Yes, he continued to talk about how bad ObamaCare is and how Republicans had darned well better replace it. But he hardly had a good word to say about the replacement itself.

Barack Obama had a bad habit as president of commenting on his own government as if he was giving a TED talk rather than serving as the nation's chief magistrate. Professor Obama was a well-known and little-loved persona.

Trump has taken it to a new level. He’s the quarterback, but he’s heckling his own team instead of calling plays in the huddle. And, like the cranks on sports call-in shows, explaining how he would have done it differently with far-fetched strategies.

When he tells Republicans that they should just let millions of families face devastation rather than taking political blame for trying to fix the problem, he is the perfect Monday morning quarterback.

Today, the president took a step to rectify that, reading remarks praising the seemingly doomed legislation at a luncheon for Republican Senators. If he really wants this bill to pass, he’d better take that message to heart and sell, sell, sell.

THE RULEBOOK: NO TROUBLEMAKERS

“The hope of impunity is a strong incitement to sedition; the dread of punishment, a proportionably strong discouragement to it.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 27

TIME OUT: THE KEY TO DECIPHERING

History: “On this day in 1799, during Napoleon Bonaparte’s Egyptian campaign, a French soldier discovers a black basalt slab inscribed with ancient writing near the town of Rosetta, about 35 miles north of Alexandria. The irregularly shaped stone contained fragments of passages written in three different scripts: Greek, Egyptian hieroglyphics and Egyptian demotic. The ancient Greek on the Rosetta Stone told archaeologists that it was inscribed by priests honoring the king of Egypt, Ptolemy V, in the second century B.C. More startlingly, the Greek passage announced that the three scripts were all of identical meaning. The artifact thus held the key to solving the riddle of hieroglyphics, a written language that had been ‘dead’ for nearly 2,000 years. When Napoleon, an emperor known for his enlightened view of education, art and culture, invaded Egypt in 1798, he took along a group of scholars and told them to seize all important cultural artifacts for France.”

SCOREBOARD

Trump net job-approval rating: -17.6 points

Change from one week ago: -4.4 points



DOOMSDAY ON OBAMACARE CUTS VOTE NEXT WEEK

The Hill: “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Republicans will try to move forward with their plan to repeal ObamaCare next week, even as they appear short of the needed votes to pass the proposal. … The Senate is expected to vote on whether or not to take up the House-passed healthcare bill, which is being used for any action in the upper chamber. If they are successful, McConnell would offer the ObamaCare repeal proposal as an amendment to that legislation.”

Centrist Republicans and Democrats meet to devise bipartisan plan - WashEx: “Moderate Republicans and Democrats met Tuesday to discuss a way forward on healthcare and the two camps are considering developing a working group on the issue. Shawn Moran, the communications director for Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., told the Washington Examiner the centrist GOP's Tuesday Group, which Dent chairs, and the New Democrat Coalition met in the Capitol to discuss healthcare.”

Is Rand Paul’s health-care stance really based on principle? - Jonah Golberg examines the balance of self-interest and merits in politics. National Review: “I found many of [Sen. Rand] Paul’s arguments and complaints entirely persuasive on the merits. But there have been times when I had to wonder if the merits were all that was driving him. Was it just a coincidence that the bill was terribly unpopular in his home state of Kentucky, where more than one in five Kentuckians are on Medicaid?”

House pushes ahead on budget plan - AP: “Republicans are pressing ahead with a budget plan designed to help the party to deliver on a GOP-only effort to overhaul the tax code. The plan before the House Budget Committee on Wednesday also features promises to cut more than $5 trillion from the budget over the coming decade, though Republicans only appear serious about actually enacting a relatively modest $203 billion deficit cut over the same period.”

House GOP to stick with partisan strategy on taxes - Roll Call: “Republicans’ partisan push to overhaul the health care system failed in the Senate, but House GOP lawmakers say they plan to stick to that approach in rewriting the tax code. Since the start of the year, Republicans have said the health care and tax overhauls, the top two items on their legislative agenda, would likely be partisan efforts given wide policy gaps with Democrats on both issues. With that strategy in mind, they decided to move both overhauls through the budget reconciliation process — health care in fiscal 2017 and taxes in fiscal 2018 — to allow for a simple-majority vote in the Senate.”



Tax reform becomes a must-win issue for the White House - Politico: “… the White House has turned its attention to its next big shot at a big win: tax reform. The long-held GOP goal of re-engineering the U.S. tax system has now become a political imperative for the Trump administration, which has yet to deliver any major legislative victories despite Republican control of the White House and both houses of Congress. … Donors and influential Republicans are particularly eager to see tax reform completed before the 2018 midterms….”

TRUMP JR., MANAFORT CLEARED TO TESTIFY BEFORE SENATE

ABC News: “Donald Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort have been cleared by special counsel Robert Mueller to testify in an open session before the Senate Judiciary Committee about their June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian attorney, according to the committee's ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. Feinstein, who met with Mueller last month, shared the information with reporters Tuesday, later adding that the special counsel's investigation would ""not be a problem"" that would prevent their testimony. The news of the pair's clearance to be interviewed was first reported by CNN. The Judiciary Committee was scheduled to hold a hearing on the Foreign Agent Registration Act Wednesday, one at which Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he wanted Manafort to appear. Both he and Feinstein also suggested Trump Jr. should appear before the committee this week.”

Russian lawyer who met Trump Jr. to testify to Congress -

Reuters: “The Russian lawyer who met Donald Trump Jr. after his father won the 2016 U.S. Republican presidential nomination has said she is ready to testify to Congress. … [Natalia] Veselnitskaya has previously said she is a private lawyer, that she never obtained damaging information about Clinton, and that she has no ties with the Kremlin. ‘I'm ready to clarify the situation behind this mass hysteria – but only through lawyers or testifying in the Senate,’ Veselnitskaya said in an interview with Russia's Kremlin-backed RT TV channel released late on Tuesday.”

Ex-UN ambassador to testify before House Intel Committee - WashEx: “Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President Barack Obama, plans to testify before the House Intelligence Committee, according to a report Monday. CNN reports that Power's appearance before the committee could happen before the August recess, although a date has not been finalized. The news of Power's planned testimony comes on the same day that reports revealed Susan Rice, Obama's former national security adviser, will no longer provide testimony before the House Intelligence Committee this Tuesday.”

Trump and Putin lingered over dinner at G-20 - NYT: “The July 7 [G20] meeting in Hamburg, Germany, was the single most scrutinized of the Trump presidency. But it turned out there was another encounter: a one-on-one discussion over dinner that lasted as long as an hour and relied solely on a Kremlin-provided interpreter. … A White House official said there was nothing unusual about it. And in two tweets late Tuesday, Mr. Trump derided news reports about it as ‘sick.’ … ‘Press knew!’ he tweeted.”

Was the conversation unusual or not? - Michael Warren’s White House Watch column in the Weekly Standard: “Is this ‘second meeting’ a routine encounter at a summit of world leaders, brief and ‘perfectly normal’? If so, characterizing this moment as ‘previously undisclosed’ unfairly implies the administration ought to have disclosed it and did not. The White House likely didn’t disclose every brief conversation Trump had with any other leaders at the G20, so why should such a meeting with Putin be any different?”

Trump to nominate Huntsman as Russian Ambassador - Politico: “The White House formally announced its plans to nominate former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman as ambassador to Russia, signaling its intent to put the onetime Trump campaign critic in a leading diplomatic role. Huntsman, who sharply criticized President Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign for his statements and rhetoric about women, previously served as ambassador to Singapore under President George W. Bush and ambassador to China under President Barack Obama. He was reportedly offered the position in March, a move the Trump administration publicly solidified Tuesday.”

SESSIONS DRAWS HEAT OVER SEIZURES

WashEx: “Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday rolled out a new civil asset forfeiture policy aimed at expanding law enforcement's ability to seize property from people suspected of criminal activity. The new policy allows the federal government to take all assets seized lawfully by state or local law enforcement whenever the crime causing the seizure violates federal law. The Justice Department said the change advances Sessions' recently created task force to combat violent crime and will crack down on criminals. Critics have argued the civil asset forfeiture seizes property from people who are innocent and are never charged with a crime. But Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told reporters on Wednesday that the aim of the change is to focus on assets related to criminal activity. ‘It's not about taking assets from innocent people,’ Rosenstein said. ‘It's about taking assets that are the proceeds of […] criminal activity, primarily drug dealing.’”

ROGUE GOAT

BBC: “On Monday morning staff at a US polymer manufacturer arrived at work to discover a break-in. The doors had been smashed, glass littering the floor. Police were called. When staff at Argonics Inc's Colorado office realised nothing had been taken they reviewed CCTV footage of the doors. The suspect had not even bothered to cover their face. Plus, unusually, protruding from that face were long horns - a rogue goat was behind the damage. … ‘Our office manager arrived at the office on Monday morning and saw the doors were smashed,’ a company spokesperson told the BBC. ... ‘Once the police arrived, he thought to check the camera footage and saw that it was actually the goat.’ What sparked the goat's violent outburst remains unclear, but it hasn't prevented social media users from speculating about the goat's motives.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“But what federalism really wants – I think it encourages and is, I think, enriched by having states try things. Even the things I don't like: assisted suicide started in Oregon, smoking dope started to be legal in Colorado and Washington state, and apparently, at least as of yet, they appear to be doing OK. So maybe you learn the lessons by having states do it. That's a healthy thing.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.”

Goldstone, a PR man for recording artists who set up the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney who promised dirt on Hillary Clinton, reportedly fears for his own safety. The 57-year-old British flack is globetrotting with his much-younger companion, and posting photos from around the world on social media to “hide in plain sight,” according to reports.

Photos posted online since the trip began last month in London haveshown them in Venice, Croatia, Montenegro and Greece. Goldstone is currently believed to be aboard a ship in the Mediterranean, with his lover and business partner David Wilson.

“If I were him, I'd never go back to New York and I'd certainly never set foot in Russia again.” — Geoff Baker, fellow publicist and friend of Goldstone

He fears that if he turns up dead, it will be no accident, The Express reported, citing a longtime colleague. Goldstone’s strategy, according to Geoff Baker, also a British publicist, is to avoid New York and Russia and let everyone know where he is all the time.

“I believe the reason he's being so blatantly transparent about his whereabouts is that, if anything does happen to him - like a car crash or being stabbed by a poison-tipped umbrella - everyone will know his death was no accident,' Baker told the newspaper.

Baker’s was referring to the infamous 1978 rubout of Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian dissident who was stabbed in the thigh with a poisoned umbrella tip as he waited for a bus in London.

It was unclear who Goldstone thinks could be out to kill him.

Goldstone, founder of Oui 2 Entertainment in New York, emailed Donald Trump Jr. on June 3, 2016, writing, “the Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his (Emin’s) father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some useful documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

A subsequent meeting, only revealed to the public recently, has stoked fresh accusations the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to win the election.

“If I were him, I'd never go back to New York and I'd certainly never set foot in Russia again,” Baker told The Express. “Knowing him as I do, I think he'll end up back in Britain or, if he feels threatened, he'll ask for protection at the nearest British embassy.”

The website of OUI 2 Entertainment, which according to the company’s website, represents ""some of the biggest music brands and entertainment events in the country,” is making no secret of its co-founder’s ties to the Trump Jr. story. The company has posted a link on its Facebook page that leads viewers to a report on Goldstone’s “Pivotal Role in the Donald Trump Jr. Scandal.”

The Facebook page is replete with photos of Goldstone wearing silly hats, traveling, and posing with a variety of seemingly well-connected and attractive acquaintances. According to an acquaintance who spoke with the Daily Beast, Goldstone leads a hard-partying, playboy-type lifestyle."

Trump Jr. also responded to Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Chris van Hollen (D-Md.), who slammed the meeting.

Kaine wondered aloud to a reporter whether 39-year-old committed treason.

Trump Jr. said he would have divulged the contents of the meeting to authorities if they were ""shady"" or a ""threat to national security.""

""They're trying to drag out the story. I'm more than happy to be transparent about it,"" he said.

Guy Benson thinks people are getting out over their skis with speculation about Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer, but there are serious questions that need to be answered.

The New York Times reported that Trump Jr. was informed in an email that attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya would offer him compromising information about Hillary Clinton in a June 2016 meeting.

Trump Jr. has confirmed that he originally went into the meeting with the impression Veselnitskaya might have information on Clinton useful to his father's campaign, but he said nothing came from the meeting and he was unaware that Veselnitskaya was possibly Kremlin-connected.

""There's a part of me that wonders, 'Is this too perfect?'"" Benson said on ""America's Newsroom"" today. ""There's another part of me that says, 'If the email exists, it's very serious here.'""

He said people should be cautious with this report, because it cites unnamed sources and the Times reporters apparently haven't seen the email themselves.

""There are some weird elements to this whole story,"" Benson said.

He acknowledged, however, that it looks suspicious that yet another member of the Trump team had a connection with Russia. He said it's also suspicious that Trump Jr. has shifted his story a couple times as new information came out.

""I think it's a bit much to claim, at this point, there's nothing to see here,"" Benson said. ""It may not be a smoking gun, but it smells like some smoke.""

He said the fact that multiple Trump associates have had to walk back claims about having no contact with Russia - from Jeff Sessions to Jared Kushner to Trump Jr. - ""gives an appearance of guilt.""

He said sworn testimony from Trump Jr. would be helpful in clearing this up, but it's most critical to see the actual email, if it exists.

""I don't think that they're out of the woods on this particular story,"" Benson said, urging people to ""wait and see.""

""I think we've seen a lot of people getting out over their skis, jumping to conclusions on both sides. 'He's guilty.' 'He's innocent.' 'It's a bombshell.' 'It's nothing,'"" Benson said. ""We don't know yet, but this is serious and should be taken seriously.""

During recent trips to Croatia and Malta, a Dubai-based billionaire and business partner of the Trump Organization looked more like a head of state himself — mingling with government dignitaries, receiving a presidential reception and visiting the glittering Mediterranean Sea.

Hussain Sajwani met with leaders in the two European nations and addressed local journalists, many of whom referred to his ties to President Donald Trump or simply called him ""the Donald of Dubai.""

Sajwani's trips, as well as a recent deal in Oman, show that Trump's business partner in Dubai wants to expand his development empire beyond the Mideast and a tower under construction in London.

Enter Sajwani's DAMAC Properties, which launched a new effort this week to sell Trump-branded villas at the golf course bearing the American president's name.

""My dream is as we have put our major, iconic tower in London, that we do repeat that in major gateway cities around the world,"" Sajwani said in a July online video. ""Tokyo, Toronto, New York, Paris, I don't know. But that would be a dream — to grow DAMAC with its iconic brands around the world.""

Sajwani's dream for a global expansion — as well his growing online presence among social media videos and posts — received a major boost with Trump taking the White House. It also raised the public profile of a billionaire whose fortune grew in part out of contracting work his companies did in supplying U.S. forces during the 1991 Gulf War that expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait.

DAMAC Properties declined an Associated Press interview request with Sajwani. In a statement, DAMAC spokesman Niall McLoughlin said the company is ""exploring opportunities in major gateway cities across Europe and the U.S., hence the numerous and ongoing meetings over the past many years"" by Sajwani.

Sajwani wholeheartedly embraced Trump, even as the U.S. presidential candidate's campaign saw him call for a ""complete shutdown"" of Muslims coming to the United States. Once reaching office, Trump's travel ban on six predominantly Muslim countries avoided naming the UAE, a major U.S. ally that hosts some 5,000 American troops and is the U.S. Navy's busiest foreign port of call.

In February, Trump's sons Eric and Donald Jr. opened the Trump International Golf Club in Dubai , the first of two to be built in the sheikhdom by Sajwani. DAMAC share prices have nearly doubled from 2.17 dirhams (59 cents) a share on the day of the U.S. election in November, to a high of over 4 dirhams ($1.09).

That made Sajwani, who owns over 70 percent of DAMAC stock, even richer.

However, economies overall have slowed across the Middle East amid a glut in global oil prices. An ongoing diplomatic dispute between Arab nations and Qatar has likely also affected DAMAC, as 6 percent of all its customers from 2014 to 2016 were Qataris, according to an April filing by the company on the Nasdaq Dubai. DAMAC announced results Monday that put its second-quarter earnings at 704 million dirhams ($191.6 million), down from 864 million dirhams ($235.2 million) in the same period last year.

Facing that sluggish market, Sajwani has begun to look abroad.

In Oman, he signed a deal in June with the state-run Oman Tourism Development Co. for DAMAC to help redevelop Port Sultan Qaboos in Muscat, a project valued overall at $1 billion.

Then in July, Sajwani visited Croatia and met with President Kolinda Grabar Kitarovic. Sajwani also visited tourist towns along the coast of the Adriatic Sea, according a DAMAC statement at the time. The local branch of Colliers International, a commercial real estate firm headquartered in Toronto, said it organized the three-day trip for Sajwani, trying to pitch him on developments on the Istria peninsula and Central and Southern Dalmatia.

DAMAC ""continues to look at the investment opportunities"" in Croatia, primarily along the Adriatic, said Vedrana Likan, the managing partner of Colliers' Croatian arm.

Sajwani then traveled to Malta, an archipelago nation off Italy in the Mediterranean Sea, and met with Prime Minister Joseph Muscat.

Both Croatia and Malta are members of the European Union, which Emirati citizens have been able to travel to without visas since 2015. That can drive business for any possible DAMAC project in either country, as well as create new European interest in Dubai, where the developer makes its real money, said Issam Kassabieh, an analyst with the UAE-based firm Menacorp Finance.

""It's a very effective method of branding,"" Kassabieh said. ""Once foreign investors see the DAMAC name in Europe, they'll follow it all the way back to the source, which is Dubai, so they can capitalize on it here.""

Meanwhile, DAMAC Properties just this week launched a new set of Trump-branded duplex villas, priced from 2.96 million dirhams ($806,000) that include three-year memberships at the golf course. The company previously offered stand-alone villas at prices starting at 5 million dirhams ($1.3 million) up to 15 million dirhams ($4 million).

The Trump Organization, now run by Trump's adult sons though the president hasn't divested from it, also tweeted that the new villas were for sale . It told the AP that the villas are ""not a new project"" and represented ""our longstanding relationship with DAMAC Properties.""

While DAMAC merely mentions Trump as representing ""the most respected developments throughout the world,"" one Dubai newspaper more bluntly suggested buyers could ""own a piece of the Trump name.""

And while it remains unclear how Sajwani trades on his Trump ties in private meetings with foreign leaders, advertising and marketing by DAMAC prominently features Trump. That could lead to potential conflicts, said Norman Eisen, who served as President Barack Obama's lead ethics attorney and who now is a part of a watchdog group suing Trump for his alleged violations of a clause of the U.S. Constitution that prohibits foreign gifts and payments.

If Sajwani ""is featuring the Trump name in his marketing materials and if, as one can fairly assume, that's being furnished to government officials and others, then that would be a not-very-subtle attempt to trade on his business partner's presence in the White House,"" Eisen said.

Goldstone, a PR man for recording artists who set up the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney who promised dirt on Hillary Clinton, reportedly fears for his own safety. The 57-year-old British flack is globetrotting with his much-younger companion, and posting photos from around the world on social media to “hide in plain sight,” according to reports.

Photos posted online since the trip began last month in London haveshown them in Venice, Croatia, Montenegro and Greece. Goldstone is currently believed to be aboard a ship in the Mediterranean, with his lover and business partner David Wilson.

“If I were him, I'd never go back to New York and I'd certainly never set foot in Russia again.” — Geoff Baker, fellow publicist and friend of Goldstone

He fears that if he turns up dead, it will be no accident, The Express reported, citing a longtime colleague. Goldstone’s strategy, according to Geoff Baker, also a British publicist, is to avoid New York and Russia and let everyone know where he is all the time.

“I believe the reason he's being so blatantly transparent about his whereabouts is that, if anything does happen to him - like a car crash or being stabbed by a poison-tipped umbrella - everyone will know his death was no accident,' Baker told the newspaper.

Baker’s was referring to the infamous 1978 rubout of Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian dissident who was stabbed in the thigh with a poisoned umbrella tip as he waited for a bus in London.

It was unclear who Goldstone thinks could be out to kill him.

Goldstone, founder of Oui 2 Entertainment in New York, emailed Donald Trump Jr. on June 3, 2016, writing, “the Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his (Emin’s) father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some useful documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

A subsequent meeting, only revealed to the public recently, has stoked fresh accusations the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to win the election.

“If I were him, I'd never go back to New York and I'd certainly never set foot in Russia again,” Baker told The Express. “Knowing him as I do, I think he'll end up back in Britain or, if he feels threatened, he'll ask for protection at the nearest British embassy.”

The website of OUI 2 Entertainment, which according to the company’s website, represents ""some of the biggest music brands and entertainment events in the country,” is making no secret of its co-founder’s ties to the Trump Jr. story. The company has posted a link on its Facebook page that leads viewers to a report on Goldstone’s “Pivotal Role in the Donald Trump Jr. Scandal.”

The Facebook page is replete with photos of Goldstone wearing silly hats, traveling, and posing with a variety of seemingly well-connected and attractive acquaintances. According to an acquaintance who spoke with the Daily Beast, Goldstone leads a hard-partying, playboy-type lifestyle."

Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume responded this morning on the New York Times reports on a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.

In reports over the weekend, the Times said Trump's eldest son and other campaign associates met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya last summer.

The paper also reported that Trump gave two different explanations for the meeting. He pushed back on Twitter this morning, maintaining the meeting was ""primarily about adoptions.""

No inconsistency in statements, meeting ended up being primarily about adoptions. In response to further Q's I simply provided more details. https://t.co/FdT1D4hfhz — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 10, 2017

Hume said the story, like others before it, is receiving ""huge play"" across the mainstream media, but falls short of proving collusion by the Trump team.

He said Trump Jr. appears to have been ""conned"" by going to a meeting expecting to receive ""dirt"" on the Clintons.

""It's one more case where we have evidence of a contact of some kind with somebody connected to Russia, but no evidence of collusion,"" said Hume.

He said the media will go ""on and on"" about it, but most Americans will likely wonder what ""all the fuss is about.""

Browder, who is the CEO of Hermitage Capital Management, was previously a hedge fund manager in Russia and one of the country's most successful foreign investors.

The businessman also worked on reducing corporate corruption in the country for years. But in 2005, his entry into Russia was revoked after the government declared him a ""threat to national security,"" according to his website.

In 2012, he spearheaded the Magnitsky Act -- a sanctions package on Russia that was imposed for the first time in 35 years. The sanctions were created to punish Russian officials involved in the death of Browder's accountant, Sergey Magnitsky, who was jailed in 2008 and died under mysterious circumstances a year later.

Magnitsky uncovered a $230 million corruption scheme involving Russian officials just before he was arrested.

Browder also is familiar with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who recently came into the spotlight when it was revealed she met with Donald Trump Jr. last year during the U.S. election, reportedly to offer damaging information on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Browder told NPR Veselnitskaya was part of the campaign to repeal the Magnitsky Act.

On Wednesday, Browder is expected to testify about Russian foreign agents working in the U.S. and Russia's attempt to repeal the Magnitsky Act. Browder said in his prepared opening statement ahead of his testimony that he will be speaking about ""the enablers who conducted this campaign in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, by not disclosing their roles as agents for foreign interests."""

More information leaked out today on Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.

Veselnitskaya told NBC News on Monday she was not with the Kremlin as was reported by The New York Times.

She confirmed her meeting with Donald Trump Jr. was about Russian adoptions in the US.

The law firm where Veselnitskaya is listed as managing partner, Kamerton Consulting, is based in a Moscow suburb and does not even have a website.

A staff member at Kamerton told The Associated Press Veselnitskaya was unavailable for comment on Monday.

Her office in Moscow may be a shell. There is no working phone, email or website.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that the Kremlin is unaware of a meeting between Trump’s senior staff and Veselnitskaya and “does not know who that is.”

Peskov said,

“No, we don’t know who that is and obviously we can’t monitor all meetings Russian lawyers hold both in Russia and abroad.”

Now this…

Natalia Veselnitskaya was sitting with Obama’s Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul during a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, 8 days after cold-contacting Trump Jr. in Trump Tower.

Here is another shot from the June 14, 2016 Congressional hearing on Russia and the Ukraine.

MORE— That looks like Emin Agalarov sitting next to Natalia Veselnitskaya. He was mentioned in Donald Trump Jr’s statement this morning. Emin helped set up the meeting with Veselnitskaya.

Veselnitskaya was also connected to Fusion GPS, the DNC opposition research firm that produced the fraudulent and discredited Trump Dossier.

The liberal media jumped on the story noting that Akhmetshin a Russian operative and was helping Trump get elected.

But Rinat Akhmetshin was working with Fusion GPS, an organization linked to the Democrat Party, and has worked the shadowy corners of the Washington lobbying scene for nearly 20 years.

What the media is not saying is that Rinat Akhmetshin worked for Fusion GPS, the organization behind the discredited Trump Russia dossier.

Today, Fusion GPS employee Rinat Akhmetshin today confirmed his attendance at a meeting with Donald Trump Jr, Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner along with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Accusations have arisen that the meeting was part of a wider setup to achieve a FISA warrant to wiretap phones of the Trump campaign during 2016. President Trump himself has accused the FBI under Loretta Lynch of wiretapping his campaign.

Akhmetshin was linked to Fusion GPS and involved in a pro-Russian campaign in 2016 which involved lobbying congressional staffers to undermine the Magnitsky Act.

A new report about Donald Trump Jr,’s meeting with Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya reveals she brought with her a plastic folder with printed out documents alleging a flow of illicit funds to the Democrats.

AP reported:

In his first public interview about the meeting, Akhmetshin said he accompanied Veselnitskaya to Trump Tower where they met an interpreter. He said he had learned about the meeting only that day when Veselnitskaya asked him to attend. He said he showed up in jeans and a T-shirt. Veselnitskaya brought with her a plastic folder with printed-out documents that detailed what she believed was the flow of illicit funds to the Democrats, Akhmetshin said. Veselnitskaya presented the contents of the documents to the Trump associates and suggested that making the information public could help the campaign, he said. “This could be a good issue to expose how the DNC is accepting bad money,” Akhmetshin recalled her saying. Trump Jr. asked the attorney if she had sufficient evidence to back up her claims, including whether she could demonstrate the flow of the money. But Veselnitskaya said the Trump campaign would need to research it more. After that, Trump Jr. lost interest, according to Akhmetshin. “They couldn’t wait for the meeting to end,” he said.

Akhmetshin also said he does not know if Veselnitskaya’s documents were provided by the Russian government. He said he thinks she left the materials with the Trump associates. It was unclear if she handed the documents to anyone in the room or simply left them behind, according to the AP report.

As TGP previously reported, the liberal media jumped on the story noting that Akhmetshin a Russian operative and was helping Trump get elected.

But Rinat Akhmetshin was working with Fusion GPS, an organization linked to the Democrat party, and has worked the shadowy corners of the Washington lobbying scene for nearly 20 years.

Glenn Simpson, the founder of Fusion GPS, the group behind the discredited Trump Dossier, cancelled his testimony before Congress next week.

There are also many questions swirling around as to why Veselnitskaya was allowed into the United States in June of 2016 after she was denied a visa. We do know that Veselnitskaya entered the U.S. on immigration parole earlier in the year which is not commonly granted. So far, all roads lead back to the Democrats as a possible set-up."

Special Counsel Robert Mueller has crossed the red line that President Trump warned about back in an interview with the New York Times. Since investigators can’t find any ‘Russian collusion’, Mueller has now expanded his probe into potential ‘financial crimes’ completely unrelated to Russia and the 2016 election.

The Deep State is attempting a coup right before our eyes. Mueller needs to be fired immediately.

CNN reports:

Federal investigators exploring whether Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with Russian spies have seized on Trump and his associates’ financial ties to Russia as one of the most fertile avenues for moving their probe forward, according to people familiar with the investigation. The web of financial ties could offer a more concrete path toward potential prosecution than the broader and murkier questions of collusion in the 2016 campaign, these sources said. Sources described an investigation that has widened to focus on possible financial crimes, some unconnected to the 2016 elections, alongside the ongoing scrutiny of possible illegal coordination with Russian spy agencies and alleged attempts by President Donald Trump and others to obstruct the FBI investigation. Even investigative leads that have nothing to do with Russia but involve Trump associates are being referred to the special counsel to encourage subjects of the investigation to cooperate, according to two law enforcement sources. In response to this CNN story, the President’s attorney, Jay Sekulow, said, “President’s outside counsel has not received any requests for documentation or information about this. Any inquiry from the special counsel that goes beyond the mandate specified in the appointment we would object to.”

The Wall Street Journal reported Mueller will impanel a Washington Grand Jury to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 president election.

The grand jury, which began its work in recent weeks, is a sign that Mr. Mueller’s inquiry is ramping up and that it will likely continue for months. Mr. Mueller is investigating Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 election and whether President Donald Trump’s campaign or associates colluded with the Kremlin as part of that effort. A spokesman for Mr. Mueller, Joshua Stueve, declined to comment. Moscow has denied seeking to influence the election, and Mr. Trump has vigorously disputed allegations of collusion. The president has called Mr. Mueller’s inquiry a “witch hunt.” Ty Cobb, special counsel to the president, said he wasn’t aware that Mr. Mueller had started using a new grand jury. “Grand jury matters are typically secret,” Mr. Cobb said. “The White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly.…The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.”

Reuters just reported grand jury subpoenas have been issued in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya last June."

Donald Trump Jr. Beats #FakeNews and Releases Entire Email Chain on Meeting Russian Lawyer

Donald Trump Jr. beat the #FakeNews media to the punch and released the ENTIRE email chain of his conversation with Rob Goldstone on a meeting with a Russian lawyer.

Donald Trump Jr. released this statement on Tuesday morning.



Here is his statement:

“To everyone, in order to be totally transparent, I am releasing the entire email chain of my emails with Rob Goldstone about the meeting on June 9, 2016. The first email on June 3, 2016 was from Rob, who was relating a request from Emin, a person I knew from the 2013 Ms. Universe Pageant near Moscow. Emin and his father have a very highly respected company in Moscow…. The woman as she has said publicly, was not a government official. And, as we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act. To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue. As Rob Goldstone said just today in the press, the entire meeting was “the most inane nonsense I ever heard. And I was actually agitated by it.”

Then the president’s son released the entire emeail chain with Rob Goldstone who arranged the meeting on confidential Clinton information.

The email chain shows the full discussion with Rob Goldstone to set up a meeting with a Russian lawyer on June 9, 2016.

Nothing came from the meeting.

The lawyer does not work for the Russian government.

The meeting lasted 20 minutes.

The entire story is another big nothingburger.

And Donald Trump Jr. beat the media to the punch – so they can’t publish any more screaming headlines on this 20 minute meeting.

Wikileaks leaked an email from the ‘Podesta emails’ showing Hillary’s camp internally bragging that they killed a Bloomberg story linking Bill Clinton’s $500K Moscow cash to the Magnitsky bill. Let’s talk about Russian collusion, shall we?

FOX News reported on Clinton’s speech in Russia:

Trump White House officials now are trying to draw attention to that speech and the Clintons’ ties to Russia in a bid to counter criticism over Trump Jr.’s now-infamous meeting. “If you want to talk about having relationships with Russia, I’d look no further than the Clintons,” Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a briefing last week. “Bill Clinton was paid half a million dollars to give a speech to a Russian bank, personally thanked by President Putin.” The former president indeed had received a personal call from then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin expressing his appreciation for the speech. According to Mrs. Clinton’s ethics disclosure form filed while she was secretary of State, Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 by the Russia-based finance company Renaissance Capital for his June 29, 2010, speech in Moscow to its employees and guests attending the company’s annual conference.

It was a meeting that went very, very quickly — very fast — two of the people in the room, one of them left almost immediately and the other was not really focused on the meeting.

Congressional investigators now want access to Donald Trump Jr.’s phone records related to the June 2016 meeting with the Russian lawyer.

Apparently the emails he handed over and testimony aren’t enough–for something that ISN’T EVEN ILLEGAL.

CBS News:

Congressional investigators are interested in obtaining phone records pertaining to Donald Trump Jr.’s June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer, CBS News has confirmed. CBS News’ Jeff Pegues reports that a congressional source says there is “high interest” in obtaining cell phone records and phone records in general around the meeting, which Trump Jr. had agreed to because he had been led to believe that the lawyer had damaging information about Hillary Clinton. And there is also interest in the email accounts of all of those involved in the meeting. In addition to Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort also attended the gathering. A congressional source says “we want all relevant documents” connected to the people in the meeting. Investigators would want to know all that was discussed between the parties, before, during and after the meeting.

The fake news media had a fit over the fact that President Trump supposedly advised his son, Don Jr. on a statement regarding his meeting with the Russian lawyer. Again, there is nothing illegal about this, but the media sycophants and evil liberals must continue to push the ‘Russian collusion’ story in order to deflect from the real crimes committed by the Obama administration."

This is all discussion frankly of no consequence. There was no follow-up. It was disclosed to the proper parties which is how The New York Times found out about it to begin with. The Democrats want to continue to use this as a PR stunt and they are doing everything they can to keep this story alive and in the papers every single day. The President, the American people, they voted America first, not Russia first… He certainly didn’t dictate. He certainly weighed in like any father would. I think the bigger question is, everybody wants to make this some story about misleading.

GPS Fusion founder, Glenn Simpson, among other Democrats were on the payroll of the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. in June of 2016.

GPS Fusion is the company that reportedly commissioned the garbage dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele which was subsequently published by Buzzfeed. The debunked dossier was a hit piece on Trump with outrageous stories about his encounters with Russian prostitutes.

The Daily Caller reported:

A national outcry has erupted in the establishment media about Trump Jr.’s meeting with Veselnitskaya. But there has been little focus on the Democrats who willingly served for years on her payroll helping to wage a Russian-led lobby campaign against the law. Congress passed the legislation, the Magnitsky Act, in response to the murder of Sergei Magnistky, a Russian lawyer who alleged corruption and human rights violations against numerous Russian officials. Radical left-wing icon former California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums was a hired lobbyist for Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. June 9, 2016. The former congressman is only one of a notable team of partisan Democrats Veselnitskaya hired to defeat the Magnitsky Act. Glenn Simpson, founder of Fusion GPS, also joined the Russian lawyer and “worked with her on a legal case for years,” according to The Washington Post.

According to a report by the Washington Post, Fusion GPS admits to working with Veselnitskaya for more than two years, but had no involvement in the meeting…right…

Fusion GPS says it had no involvement in the meeting although it did work on a lawsuit that involved Veselnitskaya for more than two years. The firm’s work on the Trump dossier was on a different timeline. Nevertheless, Trump’s legal team is already conflating the two issues as part of their defense of the president’s son.

Of course Trump’s legal team sees the connection:

On Monday, Mark Corallo, a spokesman for President Trump’s outside counsel, alleged that the meeting had been set up under false pretenses and implied that Veselnitskaya’s association with Fusion GPS was relevant to the alleged deception. “Specifically, we have learned that the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS, a firm which according to public reports, was retained by Democratic operatives to develop opposition research on the president and which commissioned the phony Steele dossier,” Corallo said in a statement.

Fusion GPS vehemently denies the connection:

“Fusion GPS learned about this meeting from news reports and had no prior knowledge of it,” the company told me in a statement. “Any claim that Fusion GPS arranged or facilitated this meeting in any way is false.”

As TGP previously reported, conservative watchdog group, Judicial Watch is suing for FBI records on this dossier.

President of Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton had this to say about this dossier:

“The so-called Trump dossier is at the center anti-Trump Russian collusion conspiracy theory. It is disconcerting that the Obama FBI and Justice Department trafficked this document and evidently used it to justify unprecedented surveillance of the Trump team. Our new lawsuit seeks to expose the truth about this dossier. Maybe with new leadership at the FBI, we’ll finally get some answers.”

FBI Director James Comey actually used this debunked dossier to obtain a FISA warrant. We are only seeing the tip of the iceberg of the 8 year crime spree also known as the Obama administration. Obama admin criminals were banking on a Hillary Clinton victory which meant their criminality would be covered up."

Scaramucci called Priebus a “paranoid schizophrenic” in an interview President Trump viewed as inappropriate, according to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

In the same interview, the outgoing communications director also insulted White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in saying he “sucks his own cock.”

Conway, currently a counselor to the president, served as Trump’s campaign manager and was previously a Republican pollster.

As TGP previously reported, The New York Times published another hit piece on the Trump Campaign and a meeting with Russia.

The bottom feeders at The New York Times got another anonymous tip from deep state officials that revealed Trump insiders met with a Russian lawyer to discuss adoptions from Russia.

–And Deep State officials leaked this to the NY Times.

The group that organized the meeting with Trump advisers and the Russian lawyers was the same Democratic group Fusion GPS that was behind the discredited Trump dossier.

Donald Trump Jr. released a statement detailing his meeting with the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya:

TGP also previously reported that the lawyer who met with the Trump team was denied a U.S. visa to enter, however; she received special permission to enter the United States after filing an affidavit in a Federal case in New York.

By her own account, the Russian lawyer that managed to slide her way into Trump Tower last year and meet with President Donald Trump’s eldest son, his campaign manager and son-in-law is a former Moscow prosecutor who had been denied a visa to enter the United States Natalia Veselnitskaya filed an affidavit in a federal case in New York describing how she managed to get special permission to enter the United States after the visa denial to help represent a Russian company called Prevezon Holdings owned by the Russian businessman Denis Katsyv in a case brought against it by U.S. prosecutors.

Fox News reported on Donald Trump Jr’s response:

Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner’s attorney confirmed the June 2016 meeting of the men and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower. Then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort also attended, according to the statement from Donald Trump Jr. “It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow-up,” said Donald Trump Jr. in a statement released to Fox News. “I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.” Trump Jr. does not serve in the administration and is not required to disclose his foreign contacts. Kushner lawyer Jamie Gorelick, told Fox News in a statement: “As we have previously stated, Mr. Kushner’s SF-86 was prematurely submitted and, among other errors, did not list any contacts with foreign government officials. The next day, Mr. Kushner submitted supplemental information stating that he had had ‘numerous contacts with foreign officials’ about which he would be happy to provide additional information.”

Congressional investigators trying to learn more about the Trump-Russia dossier are being stonewalled by Fusion GPS. TGP previously reported on Paul Sperry’s piece from the New York Post:

A secretive Washington firm that commissioned the dubious intelligence dossier on Donald Trump is stonewalling congressional investigators trying to learn more about its connections to the Democratic Party. The Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month threatened to subpoena the firm, Fusion GPS, after it refused to answer questions and provide records to the panel identifying who financed the error-ridden dossier, which was circulated during the election and has sparked much of the Russia scandal now engulfing the White House.

Conservative watchdog group, Judicial Watch is also suing the DOJ for FBI records on the ‘Trump dossier’. President of Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton had this to say about the dossier which was used to launch the ‘Trump-Russia’ witch hunt:

Loading...

This all looks like a set up by the DemocRATS as the FBI used the largely debunked ‘Trump dossier’, which alleged Russian ties to the President’s campaign associates, to convince a judge to grant them a FISA warrant, allowing them to secretly monitor Carter Page and others. This is why the Democrats are in panic mode after Trump’s victory. They knew all of this would come to light.

GPS Fusion founder, Glenn Simpson, among other Democrats were on the payroll of the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. in June of 2016.

Fusion GPS is the company that reportedly commissioned the garbage dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele which was subsequently published by Buzzfeed. The debunked dossier was a hit piece on Trump with outrageous stories about his encounters with Russian prostitutes.

Fusion has a sordid history and links to several questionable research products.

Now there is more evidence that links Fusion GPS to both the Democrat Party and Russia

To summarize the web of connections outlined below… we now know a Russian backed, Democrat connected research firm, with a history of smearing individuals and pitching fake information to reporters, was hired by opponents of President Trump to compile a “dossier” of supposed Trump ties to Russia.

The information that was compiled was taken seriously by the highest levels of our intelligence community along with our media, despite obvious signs that the firm behind it was tied to Russia.

As a reminder, this phony “dossier” helped spark the investigation now led by Special Counsel Mueller.

Frightening. This issue deserves A LOT more reporting and interest.

Via the GOP—–

To recap:

In recent days, we have learned more about Fusion GPS:

Fusion GPS has deep ties to Russia.

According to the testimony of William Browder this morning, along with other reporting, Fusion GPS was hired by Russians to defend Russian government connected officials from allegations of fraud.

Fusion GPS was also employed by Russians to fight against the Magnitsky Act and has worked on issues with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.

Browder spoke this morning about Fusion GPS’ tactics to work over reporters, and its efforts to run smear campaigns on behalf of their clients.

It is troubling to hear about allegations that a Russian-backed opposition research firm, with a history of smearing individuals and pitching fake information to reporters, was then hired by opponents of President Trump and the information that was compiled was taken seriously by the highest levels of our intelligence community along with our media.

See below for more information on this morning’s testimony on Fusion GPS, and HERE for an RNC Research document on the firm:"

As TGP previously reported, the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr., Natalia Veselnitskaya was denied a U.S. visa in 2015, however; she was granted temporary ‘immigration parole’ by New York federal prosecutors.

Her special permission to enter the U.S. expired in early 2016 and her request to extend her parole was denied, however; Natalia was able to enter the U.S. in June of 2016 to meet with Don Jr. at Trump Tower, New York. How was she able to enter the U.S.?

The far-left Daily Beast reported:

She (Natalia) then asked federal prosecutors for permission to enter the U.S. to work on behalf of a client in a Manhattan. Prosecutors granted Veselnitskaya temporary “immigration parole” in late 2015 but it expired in early 2016, the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York told The Daily Beast. Veselnitskaya’s parole was not renewed, the U.S. Attorney’s Office added. That raises the question of how Veselnitskaya was able to enter the U.S. in June 2016 when she visited Trump Tower. The State Department would not confirm or deny whether Veselnitskaya applied again for a visa in 2016, let alone if a visa was granted. A spokesperson told The Daily Beast the State Department could not comment due to privacy considerations. Veselnitskaya also did not respond to requests for comment. In January 2016, Veselnitskaya filed a declaration to extend her parole past that month. The U.S. Attorney’s Office objected.

Obama’s DOJ cleared the Russian lawyer initially to enter the U.S. according to an exclusive report from The Hill

Veselnitskaya had a very busy schedule in Washington DC after her meeting with Donald Trump Jr. in New York City:

The Russian lawyer who penetrated Donald Trump’s inner circle was initially cleared into the United States by the Justice Department under “extraordinary circumstances” before she embarked on a lobbying campaign last year that ensnared the president’s eldest son, members of Congress, journalists and State Department officials, according to court and Justice Department documents and interviews. This revelation means it was the Obama Justice Department that enabled the newest and most intriguing figure in the Russia-Trump investigation to enter the country without a visa. Later, a series of events between an intermediary for the attorney and the Trump campaign ultimately led to the controversy surrounding the president’s eldest son. Just five days after meeting in June 2016 at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr., presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner and then Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Moscow attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya showed up in Washington in the front row of a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Russia policy, video footage of the hearing shows. She also helped arrange an event at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. where pro-Russian supporters showed a movie that challenged the underpinnings of the U.S. human rights law known as the Magnitysky Act, which Russian leader Vladimir Putin has reviled and tried to reverse.

As previously reported, Natalia Veselnitskaya filed an affidavit in a federal case in New York describing how she managed to get special permission to enter the United States after the visa denial to help represent a Russian company called Prevezon Holdings owned by the Russian businessman Denis Katsyv in a case brought against it by U.S. prosecutors.

Strangely, she was detained and strip searched by Heathrow Airport officials based on the parole number that the U.S. assigned her…so she claims (reported by Circa News):"

Senate Democrats blocked a key witness who was set to testify against Fusion GPS, the company behind the debunked Russia dossier used to smear Trump during the 2016 presidential election.

Via Fox News:

Senate Democrats used a parliamentary maneuver Wednesday to cut short a high-profile hearing, where a key witness was set to testify on Russia’s misdeeds and also raise fresh allegations against the company behind the infamous anti-Trump dossier. Bill Browder, the CEO and co-founder of Hermitage Capital, was set to tell the Senate Judiciary Committee that the co-founder of the firm Fusion GPS was hired to conduct a “smear campaign” against him. Further, he planned to testify the campaign was orchestrated by Natalia Veselnitskaya — the Russian attorney who sought the highly scrutinized Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort in June 2016. Browder released written testimony ahead of the hearing but his public remarks were delayed when Democrats invoked the “two-hour rule” to protest Republican efforts to repeal ObamaCare. The seldom-used rule bars committees from meeting more than two hours after the full Senate begins a session.

“Veselnitskaya, through Baker Hostetler, hired Glenn Simpson of the firm Fusion GPS to conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of congressional hearings on the Global Magnitsy Act,” Browder wrote in his prepared testimony.

Browder now is expected to testify Thursday, but his statement makes clear that he will have plenty to say about Fusion GPS, the shadowy intel company founded by a pair of former Wall Street Journal reporters, including Glenn Simpson.

As TGP previously reported, just days before Glenn Simpson was set to testify in front of Congress, the Fusion GPS founder’s rep said his client has chosen not to do so, blaming the ‘partisan hearing’ process.

The Democrats are the ones with something to hide. We are dealing with pure evil here. The President and the Republicans need to get tough on the Democrats otherwise they will use the Mueller probe to take everyone down."

The mainstream media and Democratic party would like you to believe the Kremlin, even Russian President Putin, gave Russian hackers direct orders to meddle in the 2016 presidential election.

A new explosive claim by Radar Online may destroy the ‘Russia collusion’ story forever. GOP operative Jack Burkman claims Seth Rich leaked DNC emails to Natalia Veselnitskaya, the same lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr.

Radar Online reports:

New shocking evidence helps churn the theory that late former Democratic National Committee staffer, Seth Rich, was the Wikileaks source who helped hurl the 2016 presidential election into chaos, RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively. Jack Burkman, a GOP-connected lawyer who has been probing Rich’s death since the fall of 2016, tells Radar that Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, who met Donald Trump, Jr. at Trump Tower in New York City in June of 2016 also met — around the same time — with the murdered DNC employee. Burkman reveals to Radar, a current Democratic National Committee staffer, who contacted him with this information on July 20, 2017, told him that Rich provided Veselnitskaya with a cache of stolen DNC emails at their meeting that may have, later, comprised the July 22nd WikiLeaks document dump. As Radar has reported, there’s a theory that the Russians meddled in the U.S. Presidential election to benefit Donald Trump. Although refraining from sharing much information, Burkman also told Radar that he has verified the DNC staffer’s identity and position. “This is a very scared source so we had to talk them along and it took a while,” said Burkman. “We’ve confirmed the source and their identity and who they are.”

News that Seth Rich may have transferred DNC emails to Veselnitskaya comes as the Russian hacking theory is on its last leg.

The Gateway Pundit previously reported DNC email time-stamps and download speed times strongly suggest the files were not hacked — but rather obtained locally.

A mysterious IT specialist, who goes by the name The Forensicator, published a detailed report that appears to disprove the theory that the DNC was hacked by Russia.

The documents were copied on July 5th, five days before Seth Rich was murdered.

The Forensicator summarized the complex report into 10 bullet points.

The report as laid out by The Forensicator:

Based on the analysis that is detailed below, the following key findings are presented:

On 7/5/2016 at approximately 6:45 PM Eastern time, someone copied the data that eventually appears on the “NGP VAN” 7zip file (the subject of this analysis). This 7zip file was published by a persona named Guccifer 2, two months later on September 13, 2016.

Due to the estimated speed of transfer (23 MB/s) calculated in this study, it is unlikely that this initial data transfer could have been done remotely over the Internet.

The initial copying activity was likely done from a computer system that had direct access to the data. By “direct access” we mean that the individual who was collecting the data either had physical access to the computer where the data was stored, or the data was copied over a local high speed network (LAN).

They may have copied a much larger collection of data than the data present in the NGP VAN 7zip. This larger collection of data may have been as large as 19 GB. In that scenario the NGP VAN 7zip file represents only 1/10th of the total amount of material taken.

This initial copying activity was done on a system where Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) settings were in force. Most likely, the computer used to initially copy the data was located somewhere on the East Coast.

The data was likely initially copied to a computer running Linux, because the file last modified times all reflect the apparent time of the copy and this is a characteristic of the the Linux ‘cp’ command (using default options).

A Linux OS may have been booted from a USB flash drive and the data may have been copied back to the same flash drive, which will likely have been formatted with the Linux (ext4) file system.

On September 1, 2016, two months after copying the initial large collection of (alleged) DNC related content (the so-called NGP/VAN data), a subset was transferred to working directories on a system running Windows. The .rar files included in the final 7zip file were built from those working directories.

The computer system where the working directories were built had Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) settings in force. Most likely, this system was located somewhere on the East Coast.

The .rar files and plain files that eventually end up in the “NGP VAN” 7zip file disclosed by Guccifer 2.0 on 9/13/2016 were likely first copied to a USB flash drive, which served as the source data for the final 7zip file. There is no information to determine when or where the final 7zip file was built.

The most important aspect about the report is the “estimated speed of transfer (23 MB/s)” at which the documents were copied. It’s inconceivable DNC documents could have been copied at such speed from a remote location.

Disobedient Media reports:

Importantly, The Forensicator concluded that the chance that the files had been accessed and downloaded remotely over the internet were too small to give this idea any serious consideration. He explained that the calculated transfer speeds for the initial copy were much faster than can be supported by an internet connection. This is extremely significant and completely discredits allegations of Russian hacking made by both Guccifer 2.0 and Crowdstrike. This conclusion is further supported by analysis of the overall transfer rate of 23 MB/s. The Forensicator described this as “possible when copying over a LAN, but too fast to support the hypothetical scenario that the alleged DNC data was initially copied over the Internet (esp. to Romania).” Guccifer 2.0 had claimed to originate in Romania. So in other words, this rate indicates that the data was downloaded locally, possibly using the local DNC network. The importance of this finding in regards to destroying the Russian hacking narrative cannot be understated. If the data is correct, then the files could not have been copied over a remote connection and so therefore cannot have been “hacked by Russia.” The use of a USB drive would also strongly suggest that the person copying the files had physical access to a computer most likely connected to the local DNC network. Indications that the individual used a USB drive to access the information over an internal connection, with time stamps placing the creation of the copies in the East Coast Time Zone, suggest that the individual responsible for initially copying what was eventually published by the Guccifer 2.0 persona under the title “NGP-VAN” was located in the Eastern United States, not Russia.

During the presidential campaign, POLITICO reported what now appears to be a disproven story about Guccifer 2.0 hacking and releasing DNC documents:

The hacker persona Guccifer 2.0 has released a new trove of documents that allegedly reveal more information about the Democratic National Committee’s finances and personal information on Democratic donors, as well as details about the DNC’s network infrastructure. The cache also includes purported memos on tech initiatives from Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine’s time as governor of Virginia, and some years-old missives on redistricting efforts and DNC donor outreach strategy. DNC interim chair Donna Brazile immediately tied the leak to GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. “There’s one person who stands to benefit from these criminal acts, and that’s Donald Trump,” she said in a statement Tuesday night, adding that Trump has “embraced” Russian President Vladimir Putin and “publicly encouraged further Russian espionage to help his campaign.”

POLITICO then suggests Guccifer 2.0 hacked into the DNC:

Loading...

If authentic, the documents would represent the latest strike from the mysterious hacker persona that has already roiled the 2016 election with leaks of documents stolen from the DNC and the House Democrat’s campaign arm, the DCCC. Earlier document dumps include the internal communications that forced the resignation of former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz this summer and fueled allegations of party bias against Bernie Sanders.

The bombshell report brings murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich back into focus, who many believe may have been the WikiLeaks source for the DNC emails.

Tonight’s latest leak comes to you from Air Force One and the often misleading Washington Post—

According to anonymous sources flying with President Trump from Germany in July — President Trump helped his eldest son Donald Jr. in forming a statement to the media about his meeting with DNC-linked Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in 2016.

In the same report, Jared Kushner’s team of advisors and lawyers were supposedly pushing for Donald Trump Jr.’s emails about his meeting with the Russian lawyer to be leaked to the press. But how did the New York Times know about this conversation.

According to WaPo:

Hope Hicks, the White House director of strategic communications and one of the president’s most trusted and loyal aides, and Josh Raffel, a White House spokesman who works closely with Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, huddled with Kushner’s lawyers, and they advocated for a more transparent approach, according to people with knowledge of the conversations. In one scenario, these people said, Kushner’s team talked about sharing everything, including the contents of the emails, with a mainstream news organization. Hicks and Raffel declined to comment. Kushner attorney Abbe Lowell also declined to comment. The president’s outside legal team, led by Marc Kasowitz, had suggested that the details be given to Circa, an online news organization that the Kasowitz team thought would be friendly to Trump. Circa had inquired in previous days about the meeting, according to people familiar with the discussions.

There are many other people who could have leaked these emails to the press and President Trump is working on significantly reducing the leaks coming from his administration.

It is still unclear how the NY Times obtained Don Jr.’s emails.

It took the Washington Post 13 paragraphs to mention that none of this is a crime."

As the old saying goes, things happen in threes. Not only has Special Counsel Robert Mueller impaneled a Washington grand jury and grand jury subpoenas been issued over the Don Jr.-Russian lawyer meeting, but Jared Kushner’s real estate company has been subpoenaed, as well.

Independent UK reports:

New York federal prosecutors have reportedly subpoenaed Kushner Companies, the New York real estate business owned by the family of Donald Trump‘s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. The subpoenea concerns the company’s use of the controversial EB-5 visa programme to finance its development in New Jersey called One Journal Square, the Wall Street Journal reported. The EB-5 programme allows wealthy foreign investors to effectively buy US immigration visas for themselves and their families by investing at least $500,000 (£378,000) in US development projects. In a statement to the paper, Emily Wolf, the Kushner Company’s general council, said: “Kushner Companies utilised the program, fully complied with its rules and regulations and did nothing improper. “We are cooperating with legal requests for information.” It is currently unclear what potential violations the New York attorney’s office is looking into. The family was criticised earlier this year when Mr Kushner’s sister, Nicole Kushner Meyer, mentioned her brother’s work in the Trump administration while urging Chinese citizens to invest in the New Jersey project.

Reuters is reporting grand jury subpoenas have been issued in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya last June.

But that’s not all.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller is ramping up his investigation into Russia’s alleged role in the 2016 presidential election. The Wall Street Journal reports Mueller will impanel a Washington Grand Jury to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 president election.

As previously reported, on Saturday The New York Times published another hit piece on the Trump Campaign and a meeting with Russia.

The bottom feeders at The New York Times got another anonymous tip from deep state officials that revealed Trump insiders met with a Russian lawyer to discuss adoptions from Russia.

–And Deep State officials leaked this to the NY Times.

The group that organized the meeting with Trump advisers and the Russian lawyers was the same Democratic group Fusion GPS that was behind the discredited Trump dossier, according to a report from Circa News.

The plot thickens! The lawyer who met with the Trump team was denied a U.S. visa to enter, however; she received special permission to enter the United States after filing an affidavit in a Federal case in New York.

Circa News:

By her own account, the Russian lawyer that managed to slide her way into Trump Tower last year and meet with President Donald Trump’s eldest son, his campaign manager and son-in-law is a former Moscow prosecutor who had been denied a visa to enter the United States Natalia Veselnitskaya filed an affidavit in a federal case in New York describing how she managed to get special permission to enter the United States after the visa denial to help represent a Russian company called Prevezon Holdings owned by the Russian businessman Denis Katsyv in a case brought against it by U.S. prosecutors. “As counsel to Defendants, it is important that I be able to participate in the defense of this action by traveling to the United States. For that reason, I applied for a visa to enter the United States, but was denied,” she added. “I also applied for entry visas for my children, so that they could be together with me over the Christmas holiday while I was working in New York on this lawsuit, but this was also denied. However, the United States did issue a parole letter for me to enter the United States in order to help defend this lawsuit.” It was apparently during the time she was in the United States on that parole entry that she arranged to meet with Donald Trump Jr., Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and former campaign manager Paul Manafort on June 9, 2016 at Trump Tower. During the meeting Veselnitskaya raised the issue of restoring U.S. adoptions inside Russia if the United States would repeal the Magnitsky Act, a law passed in 2012 punishing Moscow for human rights violations in connection with the death of a lawyer who had discovered a massive money laundering scheme inside the country.

Fox News reported on Donald Trump Jr’s response:

Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner’s attorney confirmed the June 2016 meeting of the men and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower. Then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort also attended, according to the statement from Donald Trump Jr. “It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow-up,” said Donald Trump Jr. in a statement released to Fox News. “I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.” Trump Jr. does not serve in the administration and is not required to disclose his foreign contacts. Kushner lawyer Jamie Gorelick, told Fox News in a statement: “As we have previously stated, Mr. Kushner’s SF-86 was prematurely submitted and, among other errors, did not list any contacts with foreign government officials. The next day, Mr. Kushner submitted supplemental information stating that he had had ‘numerous contacts with foreign officials’ about which he would be happy to provide additional information.”

Congressional investigators trying to learn more about the Trump-Russia dossier are being stonewalled by Fusion GPS. TGP previously reported on Paul Sperry’s piece from the New York Post:

A secretive Washington firm that commissioned the dubious intelligence dossier on Donald Trump is stonewalling congressional investigators trying to learn more about its connections to the Democratic Party. The Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month threatened to subpoena the firm, Fusion GPS, after it refused to answer questions and provide records to the panel identifying who financed the error-ridden dossier, which was circulated during the election and has sparked much of the Russia scandal now engulfing the White House.

Conservative watchdog group, Judicial Watch is also suing the DOJ for FBI records on the ‘Trump dossier’. President of Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton had this to say about the dossier which was used to launch the ‘Trump-Russia’ witch hunt:

“The so-called Trump dossier is at the center anti-Trump Russian collusion conspiracy theory. It is disconcerting that the Obama FBI and Justice Department trafficked this document and evidently used it to justify unprecedented surveillance of the Trump team. Our new lawsuit seeks to expose the truth about this dossier. Maybe with new leadership at the FBI, we’ll finally get some answers.”

This all looks like a set up by the DemocRATS as the FBI used the largely debunked ‘Trump dossier’, which alleged Russian ties to the President’s campaign associates, to convince a judge to grant them a FISA warrant, allowing them to secretly monitor Carter Page and others. This is why the Democrats are in panic mode after Trump’s victory. They knew all of this would come to light.

The fake news media has their knives drawn over Donald Trump Junior’s meeting with a Russian lawyer during the presidential campaign. Never Trumper and GOP Senator, Susan Collins even called on the Senate Intelligence panel to interview Don Jr.

These media sycophants are however, silent over Hillary Clinton’s antics during the presidential election which makes Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting pale in comparison.

Hillary Clinton’s aides met with Ukrainian government officials and journalists specifically to dig up dirt on team Trump. The information gathered was then sent to the DNC and Hillary’s camp.

Politico reported back in a January 2017 article:

Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office. They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton’s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers, a Politico investigation found. A Ukrainian-American operative who was consulting for the Democratic National Committee met with top officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort and Russia, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation. The Ukrainian efforts had an impact in the race, helping to force Manafort’s resignation and advancing the narrative that Trump’s campaign was deeply connected to Ukraine’s foe to the east, Russia. But they were far less concerted or centrally directed than Russia’s alleged hacking and dissemination of Democratic emails.

They actually tried to downplay their efforts after Trump won the election. Certainly it was a shock to everyone working in opposition to Trump:

Shulyar vehemently denied working with reporters or with Chalupa on anything related to Trump or Manafort, explaining “we were stormed by many reporters to comment on this subject, but our clear and adamant position was not to give any comment [and] not to interfere into the campaign affairs.” Shulyar said her work with Chalupa “didn’t involve the campaign,” and she specifically stressed that “We have never worked to research and disseminate damaging information about Donald Trump and Paul Manafort.”

Evidence to the contrary…

But Andrii Telizhenko, who worked as a political officer in the Ukrainian Embassy under Shulyar, said she instructed him to help Chalupa research connections between Trump, Manafort and Russia. “Oksana said that if I had any information, or knew other people who did, then I should contact Chalupa,” recalled Telizhenko, who is now a political consultant in Kiev. “They were coordinating an investigation with the Hillary team on Paul Manafort with Alexandra Chalupa,” he said, adding “Oksana was keeping it all quiet,” but “the embassy worked very closely with” Chalupa.

Everybody Is Forgetting That Clinton Allies Did The Same Thing As Don Jr. https://t.co/zxiOU3cxN6 — Peter J. Hasson (@peterjhasson) July 10, 2017

Where is the call for Hillary Clinton and her aides to be interviewed by the Senate Intelligence panel? Why isn’t the media calling for an investigation into the Democrats’ and Hillary Clinton’s many crimes committed during the 2016 presidential election?

The Democrats unmasked Trump and his private associates to spy on his campaign. Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clinton on a tarmac and a few days later, Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton.

Loretta Lynch reportedly interfered in the election when she ordered the FBI to refer to the Hillary email investigation as a ‘matter’.

Comey also gave classified memos to a friend to leak to the press.

But Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer for 20 minutes and now some are calling it ‘borderline treason’. Unbelievable.

Here is Don Jr.’s statement regarding his 20 minute meeting with a Russian lawyer who wanted to discuss the Magnitsky Act. According to the left, this is worth investigating. The real story underneath this is who put this lawyer up to this? Stay tuned because the Democrats will soon be regretting their witch hunt as the tables slowly begin to turn on them.

From day one, the appointment of Robert Mueller as Special Counsel prompted major red flags. Mueller’s relationship with former FBI Director James Comey along with him building a team of pro-Hillary Clinton investigators simply cannot be ignored.

Reuters is now reporting that two anonymous sources (no surprise there), say investigators are plotting to flip Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort to use as leverage against President Trump.

Reuters reports:

U.S. investigators examining money laundering accusations against President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort hope to push him to cooperate with their probe into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia, two sources with direct knowledge of the investigation said. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team is examining Manafort’s financial and real estate records in New York as well as his involvement in Ukrainian politics, the officials said. Between 2006 and 2013, Manafort bought three New York properties, including one in Trump Tower in Manhattan. He paid for them in full and later took out mortgages against them. A former senior U.S. law enforcement official said that tactic is often used as a means to hide the origin of funds gained illegally. Reuters has no independent evidence that Manafort did this. The sources also did not say whether Mueller has uncovered any evidence to charge Manafort with money laundering, but they said doing so is seen by investigators as critical in getting his full cooperation in their investigation. “If Mueller’s team can threaten criminal charges against Manafort, they could use that as leverage to convince him to cooperate,” said one of the sources. Manafort’s spokesman, Jason Maloni, said, “Paul Manafort is not a cooperating witness. Once again there is no truth to the disinformation put forth by anonymous sources and leakers.”

The Gateway Pundit reported yesterday nearly 100 percent of Robert Mueller’s law firm donated to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and it’s important to note that Manafort played an important role in defeating such campaign.

Robert Mueller cannot be trusted, according to former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who told Fox News Friday that the Special Counsel’s law firm made 99.81% of its presidential campaign contributions to Hillary Clinton.

Newt Gingrich: “The Mueller investigation has so many conflicts of interest, it’s almost an absurdity. The law firm he comes from gave 99.81 percent of its donations to Hillary Clinton last year. That’s right, .19 of 1 percent went to Donald Trump. The people he has been hiring are all anti-Trump lawyers, several of them have very bad records of hiding information from the defense and one case was rebuked by the Supreme Court in a 9-0 vote. It’s hard to understand why he would assemble such a team unless it was a deliberate effort to go after the President and the President’s team.”

In addition to Reuters’ report, the LawNewz reveals Donald Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort will no longer testify publicly, instead, opting to do so behind closed doors.

Per LawNewz:

President Donald Trump‘s eldest son and his former campaign chairman won’t testify publicly next week and are instead discussing being privately interviewed by a Senate committee investigating Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election, the panel said. The committee initially called for Donald Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort to appear publicly Wednesday. But the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee now say the men are negotiating the terms of their appearances, and lawmakers don’t currently plan to issue subpoenas to force them to appear. In a joint statement, Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., also said they are negotiating with Trump Jr. and Manafort about possibly turning over documents. Both men face questions about attending a Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 that was described to Trump Jr. in emails as part of a Russian government effort to help his father’s campaign.

The news comes as Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson has chosen not to testify next week."

NBC News:

Special Counsel Robert Mueller issued grand jury subpoenas in recent days seeking testimony from public relations executives who worked on an international campaign organized by Paul Manafort, people directly familiar with the matter told NBC News.

Manafort also was present at a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lobbyist and a Russian lawyer, along with Donald Trump Jr. and Kushner. NBC News has previously reported that Kushner is under scrutiny by investigators, and that Mueller is examining whether President Trump obstructed justice.

The executive said six firms participated in the public relations effort that Manafort coordinated, paid for by a Brussels-based non-profit called the European Center for a Modern Ukraine. The stated goal was to build support for Ukraine’s entry into the European Union.

Two of the firms, Podesta Group and Mercury LLC, worked in Washington with Manafort partner Rick Gates, according to lobbying disclosure records. Three other firms worked in Europe, the executive said. NBC News could not confirm the identity of those three."

Reports are emerging that Senior Trump Advisor, Jared Kushner, has added more than 100 names to his list of contacts made throughout the campaign and transition on his FBI clearance form. This news comes in the wake of the media firestorm surrounding Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, which has dominated this week’s news cycle. This move adds fuel to the media concocted fire that the Trump administration ha been withholding information about Russian contacts.

Since the April New York Times report that Kushner failed to disclose his meeting with Russian banker and Putin confidant, Sergey Gorkov, Kushner has updated his list of contacts submitted to the FBI three times, adding over 100 names, according to a new Business Insider report.

The Daily Mail reported earlier that Kushner kept a low profile at the Allen & Company conference in Sun Valley, which he and Ivanka attended today.

“[Ivanka] spent the better part of the break between sessions with her husband, however, who seemed to be avoiding the press and photographers by hiding behind a statue on the campus. Ivanka could be seen walking over to Jared while he looked to be having a stern conversation,” Daily Mail reported.

This news comes as questions swirl as to how the Times obtained knowledge of Junior’s meeting with Veselnitskaya, and more disturbingly, how the Times received advanced copies of his emails.

Trump confidant, Roger Stone, gave a lecture to a Young Republicans gathering at the Capitol Hill Club, earlier this week. One participant pressed him on the identity of the leaker in this particular story, to which he finally conceded the individual’s initials, “J.K.,” according to the Independent Journal Review.

There are three senior level staffers with these initials, however, only one of those individuals was indisputably aware of that meeting. Kushner was present for the first part, although, Junior mentioned in his Tuesday Hannity interview, that Kushner walked out after 5 to 10 minutes of listening to Veselnitskaya and realizing the invitation to the gathering was deceptive.

“[Goldstone] sort of goosed up, he built up, there was some puffery to the email. Perhaps to get the meeting, to make it happen. In the end, there was probably some bait and switch about what it was really supposed to be about,” Don Junior told Sean Hannity. “I think it became pretty apparent to Jared and Paul. I think Jared left after a few minutes.”

This would not be the first time since Trump’s inauguration that Kushner was accused of dubious behavior, as reports surfaced within the last few months of him leaking to MSNBC in an attempt to damage Steve Bannon.

Kushner has included Veselnitskaya, as one of the hundred other meetings detailed in his updated FBI list.

The plot thickens, as the saying goes. As the “Trump-Russia collusion” story heats up, a new piece to the story emerges, with a little-known hacker who goes by the name “Johnnie Walker,” stealing the private emails of a top State Department expert on Russia.

According to Newsweek:

A hacker claimed Tuesday to be in possession of emails taken from a top State Department official who focuses on “secret” intelligence work by the diplomatic agency toward Russia, and some of the emails included exchanges between the official and Central Intelligence Agency officers, Foreign Policy reported Friday. The hacker, using the name “Johnnie Walker,” stated in an email to an unknown number of people that he had emails dating back two years from the State official’s personal Gmail account. The hacker’s motives and nation of origin are unclear, and the report does not mention wanting payment, which many hackers are known to request. The official’s identity was withheld for national security reasons. The hacker’s message claimed the emails were to and from “CIA officers and other intelligence agencies, mainstream media, NGOs and international funds” and that they would “give you evidence of who is responsible for agenda formation in many countries worldwide, especially where the situation is insecure.” While the official’s identity is unknown, he is quite high ranking and has a very specific area of expertise: Russia. “He’s probably the top intelligence guy in the entire U.S. government on Russia. He knows more than anybody about what’s going on there,” an unnamed source told Foreign Policy.

News of the hack comes on the heels of a bombshell report, covered by The Gateway Pundit, that Russia lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya brought a document outlining shady Democrat funding sources to a meeting with Donald Trump Jr.

The Times ‘exposé’ on Donald Trump Jr. is a big yawn

The news was delivered by the New York Times in the breathless tones that might announce a cure for cancer or the discovery of life on Mars:

“President Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton before agreeing to meet with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign, according to three advisers to the White House briefed on the meeting and two others with knowledge of it.”

To which a rational response is … who wouldn’t? And also: So what? A third response is unprintable.

Just as the “Russian collusion” fantasy — a resentful smear cooked up in the immediate aftermath of Clinton’s stunning defeat last fall — was finally fading from the fever swamps of the “resistance” and its media mouthpieces, along comes the Times with a pair of journalistic nothingburgers.

They first reported that Trump Jr., along with Paul Manafort (then the campaign manager) and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, met with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer “linked to” the Kremlin, back in June, shortly after Trump had clinched the Republican nomination. The second claimed she’d promised dirt on Clinton and the Democrats in order to entice Trump Jr. and the others.

According to the younger Trump, the Clinton angle was just a ruse: “Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered,” he told the Times.

The real reason, it seems, was that Veselnitskaya wanted to lobby for the repeal of the Magnitsky Act, an Obama-era law that allows the US to deny visas to Russians thought guilty of human rights violations. In retaliation, the Russians promptly ended the adoption of Russian orphans by Americans.

And that’s what all the fuss is about? No campaign in its right mind would turn down an offer of information on their opponent. That is what opposition research is all about. You can bet Hillary wouldn’t have hung up on the person who claimed to have dirt on The Donald. After all, the Clinton campaign lobbied the comedian Tom Arnold two days before the election to release potentially embarrassing footage from Trump’s TV show, “The Apprentice.” Arnold declined.

But in the end, the lawyer had nothing, gave nothing, got nothing in return, in a meeting that lasted 20 minutes. This is a scandal?

Having established the smear of “collusion,” the Times must now link every story with the word “Russia” to it in the hopes that the rubes and suckers won’t stop believing that Trump somehow cheated his way into the White House.

Hasn’t the Times learned its lesson from its disastrous Feb. 14 story, also anonymously sourced, about the Trump campaign’s “repeated contacts with Russian intelligence”? In his congressional testimony last month, former FBI Director James Comey said: “In the main, it was not true.”

But then, so are the other “collusion” stories the left is trying to peddle as proof of some sinister plot to subvert democracy. And all because they refuse to accept the results of the 2016 election. As the president might say: Sad!"

Donald Trump Jr. attended the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya, over the prospect of compromising information that Russian individuals were funding the Democratic nominee, according to the New York Times.

The Times first reported Saturday the existence of the meeting between the lawyer and Trump Jr., Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. But new reporting suggests the motivation behind it.

Trump Jr. said the inner circle met with Veselnitskaya at the request of an acquaintance.

“After pleasantries were exchanged,” Trump Jr. said in a statement to the Times, “the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton. Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.”

A spokesman for President Trump, Mark Corallo, said: “The president was not aware of and did not attend the meeting.”

Trump Jr. said the prospect of dirt on Clinton was the “pretext for the meeting” but after it began, it was clear the real agenda was policy changes that Russian President Vladimir Putin desired regarding the adoption of Russian children and the Magnitsky Act, which targets suspected human rights abusers.

White House chief of staff Reince Priebus on Sunday downplayed the meeting as a “big nothing burger” during an appearance on “Fox News Sunday.”"

The New York Times report — which cites interviews with sources as well as confidential government records — says the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower was set up by the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.

Present were Trump Jr., campaign chairman Paul J. Manafort, and Trump’s son-in-law and now top aide, Jared Kushner. The report, according to the newspaper, was confirmed by representatives of Donald Jr. and Kushner.

It quoted Donald Jr. as saying the meeting was primarily about an adoption program.

In his statement, Donald told the Times: “It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.”

The Times identified the lawyer as Natalia Veselnitskaya who is known for fighting a US law that blacklists Russian human rights abusers."

Trump Jr. posted the June 2016 e-mail chain on Twitter moments after The New York Times detailed its contents in the latest of a series of reports on a Trump Tower meeting attended by a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin.

In the first e-mail, dated June 3, 2016, publicist Rob Goldstone — who worked with the Miss Universe pageant when it was co-owned by President Trump — tipped off Trump Jr. to “something very interesting” he’d learned from Russian pop star Emin Agalarov, whom he reps.

Goldstone said the singer’s father, developer Aras Agalarov, had just met with the “Crown prosecutor of Russia,” who “offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

“This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump — helped along by Aras and Emin,” Goldstone wrote.

Goldstone’s e-mail, sent a week after Trump clinched the Republican presidential nomination, noted: “I can send this info to your father via Rhona, but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.”

Goldstone was apparently referring to Rhona Graff, a Queens native who’s been Trump’s executive assistant since 1987.

Trump Jr. wasted no time responding to Goldstone’s offer, e-mailing back 17 minutes later and suggesting he “speak to Emin first.”

“Seems we have some time and if it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer,” he wrote.

On June 6, 2016, Trump Jr. sent Goldstone his cellphone number, and the following day Goldstone wrote back, saying the elder Agalarov asked him to arrange a meeting between Trump Jr. and a “Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday.”

In a series of follow-up emails, Trump Jr. set the meeting for 4 p.m. on June 9, in his 25th-floor Trump Tower office — one floor under his dad’s — and noting that his brother-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-presidential campaign manager Paul Manafort would likely also be there.

The Times has reported that the meeting with lawyer Natalia Veslenitskaya — whose clients include Russian state-owned companies and who is married to a former deputy transportation minister — went forward as planned.

In a statement posted on Twitter, Trump Jr. said he released his “entire email chain” with Goldstone “in order to be totally transparent” about the June 9 meeting, at which Veslenitskaya “had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act.”

The 2012 law imposed sanctions on Russian officials over the suspected prison torture of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died before being posthumously convicted of tax fraud.

Trump Jr. also said he thought the information Veslenitskaya would provide was “Political Opposition Research” — marking his third explanation of why he met with her.

On Saturday, he described their sitdown as a “short introductory meeting” related to the adoption of Russian kids by Americans — which Russia ended in response to the Magnitsky Act — and on

Sunday, he said it was because he had been told she might know something “helpful” to his dad’s campaign.

President Trump on Tuesday issued a one-sentence statement saying: “My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency.”

White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, during an off-camera briefing, declined to say whether the president was aware that his son only released the e-mails after learning of the Times report.

She also challenged a suggestion that Trump Jr.’s e-mails could point to “treason or perjury.”

“I think those words are ridiculous,” she said.

Vice President Mike Pence tried to distance himself from the widening scandal.

“He was not aware of the meeting,” Pence spokesman Marc Lotter said. “He is not focused on stories about the campaign, particularly stories about the time before he joined the ticket.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a frequent critic of the president, said Trump Jr. should have immediately rejected the Russian overture.

“Anytime you’re in a campaign and you get an offer from a foreign government to help your campaign, the answer is no,” he said.

Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-LI) also criticized Trump Jr.’s actions.

“I voted for @POTUS last Nov. & want him & USA to succeed, but that meeting, given that email chain just released, is a big no-no,” Zeldin tweeted."

The committee withdrew its subpoena for Paul Manafort late Tuesday after Manafort agreed to turn over documents and to continue negotiating about setting up an interview with the panel, according to Taylor Foy, a spokesman for Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Judiciary Committee chairman. The committee also removed Donald Trump Jr. from the list of witnesses scheduled for Wednesday’s public hearing.

The panel has sought to talk with Manafort about a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting in New York with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, among other issues including his foreign political work on behalf of Ukrainian interests.

On Tuesday Manafort met with Senate Intelligence Committee staff, providing his recollection of the Veselnitskaya meeting and agreeing to turn over contemporaneous notes of the gathering last year, according to people familiar with the closed-door interview. Manafort “answered their questions fully,” said his spokesman, Jason Maloni.

Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner was also on Capitol Hill Tuesday for a second day of private meetings, this time for a conversation with lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee.

Both Manafort and Kushner have been cooperating with the committees, which, along with special counsel Robert Mueller, are probing Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion with Trump associates.

The two men have faced particular scrutiny about attending the Trump Tower meeting because it was flatly described in emails to Donald Trump Jr. as being part of a Russian government effort to aid Trump’s presidential campaign.

Manafort’s discussion with committee staff was limited to his recollection of the June 2016 meeting, according to two people familiar with the interview. Both demanded anonymity to discuss details because the interview occurred behind closed doors. Manafort had previously disclosed the meeting in documents he turned over to the committee. He has now provided the committee with notes he took at the time, one of the people said.

The other person said Manafort has also said he will participate in additional interviews with the Senate Intelligence Committee staff on other topics if necessary. Those meetings haven’t yet been scheduled.

Kushner spent about three hours behind closed doors Tuesday with the House intelligence panel. Republican Rep. Mike Conaway of Texas, who is leading the committee’s Russia probe, said he found Kushner to be “straightforward, forthcoming, wanted to answer every question we had.” He said Kushner was willing to follow up with the committee if it has additional questions.

The committee’s ranking Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, said the questions touched on “a range of issues the committee had been concerned about.”

“We appreciate his voluntary willingness to come and testify today,” Schiff added.

On Monday, Kushner answered questions from staff on the Senate Intelligence Committee, acknowledging four meetings with Russians during and after Trump’s victorious White House bid and insisting he had “nothing to hide.”

Emails released this month show that Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, accepted a June 2016 meeting with Veselnitskaya with the understanding that he would receive damaging information on Democrat Hillary Clinton as part of a Russian government effort to help Trump’s campaign. But, in his statement for the two intelligence committees, Kushner said he hadn’t read those emails until being recently shown them by his lawyers.

Kushner’s statement was the first detailed defense from a campaign insider responding to the controversy that has all but consumed the first six months of Trump’s presidency.

Kushner called the meeting with Veselnitskaya such a “waste of time” that he asked his assistant to call him out of the gathering.

“No part of the meeting I attended included anything about the campaign; there was no follow-up to the meeting that I am aware of; I do not recall how many people were there (or their names), and I have no knowledge of any documents being offered or accepted,” he said.

Kushner on Monday confirmed earlier media reports that he had suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities to set up secure communications between Trump adviser Michael Flynn, who would become national security adviser, and Russian officials. But he disputed that it was an effort to establish a “secret back channel.”

His statement describes a December meeting with Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in which Kushner and Kislyak discussed establishing a secure line for the Trump transition team and Moscow to communicate about policy in Syria."

The Russian-Azeri billionaire whose son is tied to the escalating Donald Trump Jr. email scandal is in contract to sell his Alpine, NJ mansion, sources told The Post.

Aras Agalarov bought an $8 million mansion at 159 Anderson Avenue in 2007.

Agalarov’s son, a pop star named Emin described as a Russian “Michael Bublé,” has made headlines this week for asking his publicist, Rob Goldstone, to set up a Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 that was attended by Trump Jr., his dad’s then-campaign manager Paul Manafort, current White House adviser Jared Kushner and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.

Emin also owns a New Jersey home, which he bought with his father for $3 million in 2008. At the time, he was married to Leyla Agalarova, the daughter of Azerbaijan’s dictator, Ilham Aliyev. The couple announced their divorce on Instagram in 2015, after 9 years of marriage.

Aras Agalarov listed his $8 million home for the low price of $6.98 million last month — and included the furniture in the sale, according to the listing.

A contract was signed on Tuesday, as Agalarov and his son’s relationship with the Trumps made headlines.

“It could be a coincidence,” a source said. “Alpine always sells fast if the product is priced right.”

Listing broker David Axelrad, of Prominent Properties Sotheby’s International Realty, did not return calls.

Agalarov partnered with Trump in 2013 to bring the Miss Universe Pageant to Moscow. At the time, Agalarov also signed a letter of intent to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. As a gesture of good faith, Trump even made a guest appearance in one of Emin’s videos.

The seven bedroom, ten bathroom home at 159 Anderson Avenue in Alpine sits on 2.5 acres. Built in 2001, the home features a dramatic double bridal staircase and a great room with oversized windows overlooking a landscaped yard and fountain. It also boasts a large family room, a library, vaulted ceilings, fireplaces, a formal dining room, a chef’s kitchen with a butler’s pantry, and a wet bar with a built-in aquarium. There’s also a fully finished basement with a recreation room, a media room, a gym with a sauna, a wine cellar and an extra bedroom.

“It’s really private, hidden away, with a 400 foot driveway,” a source said.

Emin’s home, at 98 Anderson Avenue, has been on the market for $2.9 million for more than a year.

The stately brick colonial is gorgeous — but Emin is never there, the source said.

“When Emin comes to New York, he stays in Manhattan, like his father, and the house remains empty,” the source said.

In May, Emin performed at the Rose Theater at Jazz at Lincoln Center for one night. Tickets were $35 to $75.

Emin’s 10,000 square foot home has six bedrooms and seven and a half bathrooms. Built in 2007, it sits on .77 acres. It features a two-story foyer with its own bridal staircase, a great room with floor to ceiling windows and French doors that lead to the patio and backyard.

There’s also a chef’s kitchen and a finished basement with a recreation room, a “full bar,” a home theater, wine cellar and gym. The listing broker is Emin’s sister Sheila Agalarova, who is a broker at Prominent Properties’ Sotheby’s International Realty."

Specifically, why are the party’s senators supporting Fusion chief Glenn Simpson in his refusal to say who paid to get that infamous President Trump-smearing “Russian dossier” drawn up?

As The Wall Street Journal’s Kimberly A. Strassel notes, Dem senators even passed on the chance to publicly question Jared Kushner and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, rather than also expose Simpson to public questioning.

Maybe Democrats simply didn’t want anything to mess up their “collusion” narrative. Or perhaps they fear their own party used Fusion to commission the hit.

She’s not the only one on the case. Writing at Tablet, the Hudson Institute’s Lee Smith notes that perhaps the “dossier” was another Russian effort to interfere in US politics — an anti-Trump one to match Moscow’s work to undermine Hillary Clinton.

Because, Smith reminds us, “the point of the Kremlin’s assault on the American election of 2016 was to defame both candidates, and sow chaos, and thereby to discredit the American system of government, which rests on the consent of the governed.”

Fabricating such dossiers looks to be a Fusion specialty. Smith and Strassel both point to the Senate testimony of Bill Browder and Thor Halvorssen, each claiming to have been targeted by a Fusion dossier.

Browder was a force behind passage of the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law that hits hard at Vladimir Putin’s inner circle and which Fusion was hired to help fight. Halvorssen is a human-rights activist (and occasional Post-Opinion contributor) who was publicizing corrupt maneuvers by Derwick Associates, a Venezuelan firm with deep ties to the Chavez regime that had partnered with Putin cronies.

As Smith notes, it’s not just Democrats in Congress who have reason to shield Fusion. The outfit has been feeding stories to the Beltway press for years, so reporting honestly on it would require “lifting the lid on the incompetence and malfeasance of their own institutions and colleagues.”

From the start, we’ve supported every effort to get to the bottom of Russia’s interference in the 2016 campaign. Will Fusion’s role in that meddling go ignored because of Democrats’ partisan interests, and the omerta of the DC press corps?"

But the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee now say the men are negotiating the terms of their appearances, and lawmakers don’t currently plan to issue subpoenas to force them to appear.

In a joint statement, Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., also said they are negotiating with Trump Jr. and Manafort about possibly turning over documents.

Both men face questions about attending a Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 that was described to Trump Jr. in emails as part of a Russian government effort to help his father’s campaign. Trump Jr. was told the lawyer had damaging information that could be used against Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and top White House aide, also attended the meeting. He is scheduled to speak behind closed doors with the Senate intelligence committee Monday and with the House intelligence committee Tuesday.

The revelation of the Trump Tower meeting renewed questions about the Trump’s campaign’s possible connections with Russia and put some of Trump’s inner circle at the forefront of ongoing federal and congressional probes.

Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni declined to comment on the committee’s announcement. Trump Jr. attorney Alan Futerfas did not respond to several attempts by The Associated Press to contact him this week, including calls and emails Friday.

Also Friday, The Washington Post, citing anonymous U.S. officials, reported that the Russian ambassador to the U.S. has said he discussed election-related issues with U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions when the two men met during the 2016 presidential race.

Trump responded to the report on Twitter on Saturday, complaining about “illegal leaks.”

“A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post,this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions,” he tweeted. “These illegal leaks, like Comey’s, must stop!”

The Post had cited anonymous U.S. officials who described U.S. intelligence intercepts of Ambassador Sergey Kislyak’s descriptions of his meetings with Sessions, who was then a foreign policy adviser to Trump and now serves as attorney general.

Department of Justice spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said Sessions stands by his previous assertion that he never had conversations with Russian officials about any type of interference with the election.

Word of the negotiations with Trump Jr. and Manafort comes as the president’s legal team evaluates potential conflicts of interest among members of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigative team, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. Mueller’s probe into Russia’s election meddling also appears likely to include some of the Trump family’s business ties.

Attorney Jay Sekulow, a member of the president’s external legal team, told The Associated Press on Thursday that the lawyers “will consistently evaluate the issue of conflicts and raise them in the appropriate venue.”

Two of the people with knowledge of that process say those efforts include probing the political affiliations of Mueller’s investigators and their past work history. The people insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

Trump himself has publicly challenged Mueller, declaring this week that the former FBI director would be crossing a line if he investigated the president’s personal business ties.

The White House push against the special counsel’s probe and the attempts to put the focus on potential conflicts with Mueller’s team may well be an effort to distract from snowballing federal and congressional investigations into possible election-year coordination between Trump’s campaign and Russia. While Trump has assailed the probes as a partisan “witch hunt,” the investigations have increasingly ensnared his family and close advisers.

Since the 2016 Trump Tower meeting became public, Trump Jr. has faced tough questions from lawmakers about why he agreed to participate. He and his father have downplayed it as politics as usual, saying they believe most people would have taken the meeting to learn about damaging information on an opponent.

Manafort had attracted scrutiny for months from congressional committees and Mueller. The Associated Press reported in June that Mueller’s probe has incorporated a long-standing federal investigation into Manafort’s financial dealings. That investigation is scrutinizing political consulting work he did for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine and the country’s former president, Viktor Yanukovych.

Manafort has denied any wrongdoing related to his Ukrainian work, saying through a spokesman that it “was totally open and appropriate.”

Manafort also recently registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for parts of Ukrainian work that occurred in Washington. The filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act came retroactively, a tacit acknowledgement that he operated in Washington in violation of the federal transparency law.

That law was scheduled to be the topic of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which he was called to appear.

The committee also is looking at the work of Glenn Simpson, a political operative who was involved in the compilation of a dossier of unsubstantiated and sometimes salacious information about Trump and his associates and their interactions with Russians.

Grassley and Feinstein said Friday that they have issued a subpoena for Simpson to appear before the committee next week.

Trump has accused former FBI Director James Comey of having leaked classified information to the media. A close friend of Comey’s has disputed that."

Yes, upon being informed in June 2016 he might soon be in receipt of information from the Russian government damaging to Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump Jr. responded with the words, “I love it.”

He didn’t call the FBI to say he had evidence the Russian government was seeking to interfere with the presidential election of 2016. No, he said, “I love it” — and set up a meeting with the shady Russian lawyer who, he was told, might share dirt with him.

He didn’t steer the Trump campaign away to shield it from the stain of a potentially scandalous encounter with an operative working for Vladimir Putin. No, Trump Jr. brought the campaign’s chairman, Paul Manafort, and his brother-in-law, Jared Kushner, into the meeting.

Donald Jr. loved it so, you see.

Now, the fact that Donald Jr. “loved” the idea of getting the goods on Hillary Clinton from a foreign antagonist doesn’t suggest anything criminal in itself.

According to the three people who set up the meeting — 1) Trump Jr., 2) a bizarre British publicist named Rob Goldstone and 3) a shady Russian lawyer named Natalia Veselnitskaya — the proceedings ended up centering on Russia’s adoption policy.

So unless they’re dissembling — and they could be — no actual collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government took place at the meeting. If they’re not prevaricating, this isn’t the smoking gun that will take down the Trump presidency.

To be sure, Donald Jr. lied outright when the New York Times contacted him about the meeting, which is not good, because lying is bad unless someone asks you whether they look fat in those pants and they do.

But as it happens, lying to the New York Times is not a crime.

At the moment, the only person who might be in some legal jeopardy as a result of the meeting is Kushner, who did not mention the meeting on the form he filled out to secure a security clearance (called an SF-86). The form specifically states that “knowingly falsifying or concealing a material fact is a felony which may result in fines and/or up to five (5) years imprisonment.”

But enough about legal jeopardy. There is too much focus on the criminal aspect of this event, which might or might not be significant. There is not enough focus on the moral aspect of this event, which is far more significant.

Donald Trump Jr.’s conduct defines the word “disgraceful.” He may not have colluded in the disruption of an American election, but the evidence of the emails he released himself indicates he was only too willing and eager to do so.

Now, politicians have had ne’er-do-well relatives throughout all history who have sought to use their kinship to their own advantage. Donald Jr. was up to something else here. He was actively seeking to aid his father’s attempt to secure the presidency of the United States.

If we knew he had been or is in bad odor with his father, or that his father has kept his distance from his son due to the kid’s poor judgment or bad behavior, that would help exculpate the president.

I’m sure there are people who will defend this, because there are people who will defend anything."

“I think it appeared pretty clear to us that one or more news organizations had them and basically what they were doing, it was kind of like a drip, drip, drip, a death by a thousand cuts,” explained New York lawyer Alan Futerfas in an interview.

“We were like, you know what, it’s silly. We’re going to be totally transparent. We’ll get it all out there,” Futerfas said.

Futerfas said he’s “heard some noise” from congressional committees investigating contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, but has not been contacted by any law enforcement officials.

The New York Times first reported the existence of the emails earlier this week and continued publishing additional details of the communication through Tuesday, when a front-page story quoted from the emails.

A British publicist had emailed Trump Jr. on June 3, 2016, promising to connect him with a “Russian government attorney” who had “some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary.”

Just a few days later, he met with the attorney, Natalia Veselnitskaya, at Trump Tower. The president’s eldest son had previously said he did not have any sit-downs with Russian officials during the campaign.

Futerfas clarified that his client eventually learned Veselnitskaya was not a “government lawyer,” although she has lobbied on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s allies.

Futerfas acknowledged that the email correspondence included unflattering language by the president’s son.

When Trump Jr. learned from publicist Rob Goldstone in June 2016 that he was poised to receive potentially damning information about Hillary Clinton from the Russian government, he responded, “I love it.”

“People may look at the optics and say, ‘I wish that language wasn’t in the email,'” Futerfas said, adding that there was a difference between “the optics and reality.”

“The takeaway was, ‘OK, someone’s got some information on the opposition. I’ll sit down and take a look at it,” Futerfas said.

Trump Jr. ultimately decided that Veselnitskaya “didn’t have any relevant information,” Futerfas said.

“It was all a set-up so she could come in and talk about adoption,” he added.

Trump Jr. has not yet been asked to testify before Congress, but “if anyone reaches out, we’ll certainly cooperate with them,” Futerfas said.

When asked about the possibility of criminal charges against Trump Jr., Futerfas said, “Law enforcement can do whatever they want to do, but the reality of what things are is there’s nothing here.”"

“They had a bilateral meeting that had been officially agreed through diplomatic channels, then they repeatedly exchanged views and remarks on the sidelines. There were no undercover or secret meetings and to assert that there were is absolutely absurd,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to Reuters.

“The use of a term like ‘undercover’ or ‘secret meeting’ raises eyebrows,” Peskov said.

Trump, in an interview with the New York Times, admitted meeting with the Russian leader during a dinner for the G20 leaders in Germany but he said it only lasted about 15 minutes and they exchanged “pleasantries” and briefly discussed an adoption issue that has raised tensions between the two countries.

It’s the same matter that the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., said he talked about with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin, during a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting.

Putin in 2012 banned adoptions of Russian children by Americans in retaliation for US sanctions on Moscow for human rights abuses.

The president had met officially with Putin at the summit earlier this month, but the White House did not reveal the dinner chat between the two leaders, which raised red flags because of the investigations into Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election.

In the Times interview, the president said he walked over to Putin, who was sitting with Trump’s wife during the dinner.

“The meal was going toward dessert,” Trump said. “I went down just to say hello to Melania, and while I was there I said hello to Putin. Really, pleasantries more than anything else. It was not a long conversation, but it was, you know, could be 15 minutes. Just talked about things. Actually, it was very interesting, we talked about adoption.”"

Ike Kaveladz works for the company owned by Emin and Aras Agalarov, the father and son Russian team who hosted the Donald Trump-owned Miss Universe pageant in 2013, the Washington Post reported.

He was identified by Scott Balber, the attorney for the Agalarovs, the newspaper said.

Kaveladze, an American citizen who speaks fluent Russian, attended the June 2016 meeting as their representative, according to the report.

Balber also told the Washington Post that he turned over Kaveladze’s name to special counsel Robert Mueller, the former FBI director who’s investigating Russian involvement in the 2016 election and any links to the Trump campaign.

“The eighth person has been identified by prosecutors and we are cooperating fully with prosecutors as a result of the investigation,” Balber told CNN.

Kaveladze is a vice president of the Moscow-based Crocus Group, where he is responsible for “multiple elements of the company’s Russian development project,” according to his LinkedIn page.

He has an economics degree from Moscow Academy of Finance and an MBA from the University of New Haven in Connecticut, his page says. He joined Crocus in 2004.

Trump Jr. agreed to meet Natalia Veselnitskaya, a lawyer with links to the Kremlin, after he was told she could provide damaging information about Clinton’s ties to Russia.

Rod Goldstone, a former tabloid journalist and publicist for Emin Agalarov, a pop singer in Russia, sent Trump Jr. an email promising that Veselnitskaya had information that “would be very useful to your father” on the Agalarovs’ behalf.

Balber said Kaveladze thought he would act as a translator at the Trump Tower meeting, but soon discovered that Veselnitskaya brought her own, a former State Department employee named Anatoli Samochornov.

Others attending the gathering included former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Rinat Akhmetshin, a lobbyist who has ties to a Russian counter-intelligence unit."

Excuse me, but wasn’t blunting the president’s success the whole point of the latest installment of the Russia, Russia, Russia story?

Isn’t that why the leakers leaked when they did, and why the Times splashed the story on its front page day after day?

Excuse the cynicism, but there is a relentless pattern, and we don’t need a crystal ball to see the future. It looks like the past and the present. No better, no worse, just more of the same.

A year from now, Donald Trump still will be president and the media and the permanent bureaucracy still will be hounding him in a ruthless bid to drive him from office.

In responding to the attacks, Trump and his team will make numerous mistakes, none fatal, but the accumulation will take a toll on his presidency.

Drip, drip, drip goes the optimism.

That’s what we’re witnessing now, with another round of toxic mud masquerading as bombshell news overshadowing all other issues, from North Korea to tax reform.

I say masquerading because, for all the intrigue about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower, and for all the hyperventilating by Maxine Waters Democrats that this was the “gotcha” moment, the end result was the same: more smoke, yet still no fire.

The Russian lawyer, despite an email introduction from a music promoter that sounded like it came from a Nigerian prince with millions to share, had no dirt on Hillary Clinton to share, government-sponsored or otherwise, and Trump Jr. quickly ended a meeting he never should have accepted.

For the media and Dems, it doesn’t matter that nothing happened. Any fact that supports the narrative that Trump is an illegitimate president is fit to print, while facts that don’t fit the narrative fall to the cutting-room floor.

On Google, collusion is defined as “secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy, especially in order to cheat or deceive others.”

In the case of Trump, collusion is anything the media and Dems say it is. The goal posts are movable.

It’s not news when presidential candidates tap foreign sources for opposition research — except when Trump does it. Then it’s impeachable collusion.

Actually, this was a mere willingness to accept dirt on Clinton. Since no dirt was forthcoming, the whole Trump family is guilty of attempted collusion, or something.

Almost as amazing as Trump’s victory last November is the fact that so little has changed in the public discourse since then. America has reached a stalemate — emphasis on stale.

Count me as surprised. I assumed the obstruction and resistance would play itself out, and the nation could get back to some semblance of a fractious routine. While the anti-Trump demonstrations have petered out, the refusal to accept him as the president by about half the country is still strong, and there is absolutely no sign that bipartisanship is about to break out in Washington.

Unfortunately, the White House’s aversion to learning new crisis skills is also stubbornly strong.

The emails Trump Jr. released yesterday should have been released at the start instead of waiting for members of Congress to also demand them. The result is an emboldened opposition and precious time wasted in a serialized melodrama over a single meeting.

By now, the president, and even his family, should know they can never count on getting a fair shake from the White House press corps. They face a rabid hostility, and everything they say and do is seen through the darkest possible lens.

It’s not going to change, so Trump must. His White House leaks too much and by every indication, nobody is in charge.

It’s up to the president to fix the ship of state. Otherwise, the fate of his presidency will be decided by his opponents.

Drip, drip, drip.

As part of that repair effort, he must finally keep his Twitter focused on important public business, not private feuds. He did the right thing Monday and got immediate results.

With the Senate unable to pass an ObamaCare replacement bill and the monthlong August recess fast approaching, Trump tweeted, “I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new health-care bill fully approved and ready to go!”

Tuesday, in the midst of the Russia smoke bomb, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell postponed the August recess by two weeks to work on ObamaCare.

Depending on what the Senate does, the decision could turn out to be the most important news of the day. Or even of the year.

Really.

New York’s junket justice

File this one under “Adding Outrage to Injury.”

The city’s Conflicts of Interest Board let Mayor Bill de Blasio accept a free trip to Germany to join rioters at the G20 summit because it involved a “city purpose” — opposing the president of the United States.

That’s nuts and a remarkably wide definition of mayoral duties, but par for the course for this administration, which uses tortured legalisms to make its suspect actions kosher.

Recall that one of the reasons prosecutors didn’t charge de Blasio with a pay-to-play scheme was that lawyers advised him that what he was doing was lawful.

The conflicts board, a mayoral rubber stamp, sent its ruling only after the mayor had left City Hall for Germany last week, The Post reports. In other words, the boss has flown the coop, so our job is to make it legal.

Is there anything the board would say no to?

Giving IRS the finger

Headline: “Man mails IRS severed finger.”

Future headline: “IRS mails finger back, wants arm and leg.”

Here’s one for the books

Sometimes it pays to be behind in your reading. In my case, 50 years behind.

In 1967, Norman Podhoretz published “Making It,” a tight memoir about his rise from a “filthy little slum child” from Brooklyn (as a teacher called him) to the editor of Commentary magazine and a famous social and literary critic.

The book largely was panned, but has been reissued as a classic by the New York Review of Books.

I’m glad I waited. It’s a fabulous read, one I probably would not have appreciated 50 years ago.

Podhoretz is best known for being a liberal-turned-conservative, but the genius of the tale here is the author’s candor about ambition. He’d been raised and taught to resist the lure of success, but can’t help himself. He wants it all, and comes to resent those who resent him for daring to admit it.

It’s a timeless New York story, but don’t deprive yourself any longer. Have the pleasure of reading it now."

“Don’t recall taking this photo with Russian intermediary Rob Goldstone, but I am in my Dynasty hat waiting for my interview with Mr. Mueller,” she wrote Monday alongside a photo of her with the British music man.

She originally tweeted that the snap was taken in 2010, but deleted that tweet and posted another without a date, according to The Hill.

Goldstone reportedly told Donald Trump Jr. in an email that the Russian government hoped to help his father get elected, and arranged a meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya so she could give him some dirt on Hillary Clinton.

Goldstone’s own social media feed is also making news: After he was outed as the middleman for the controversial meeting, The Guardian unearthed a photo he’d posted on Facebook wearing a “Russia” shirt a day after last year’s election.

Two sources told Reuters of the move on Thursday, saying it was more proof that Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in last year’s election was picking up speed.

The former FBI director made headlines earlier in the day when it was revealed that he had impaneled a new grand jury to lead the probe.

Trump Jr. and Kushner met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya on June 9, 2016 — along with Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort — after being told that they would receive damaging information on Hillary Clinton.

The meeting had been brokered by British publicist, Rob Goldstone, who has worked with the Trumps in the past.

In a statement Thursday, White House special counsel Ty Cobb claimed he didn’t know Mueller had begun using the grand jury or issuing subpoenas.

“Stock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!,” Trump wrote on Twitter.

He also gave a shout-out to Stuart Varney, a Fox Business Network anchor, who was talking up the economy.

Donald Trump Jr. on Monday defended his meeting with a Kremlin-connected attorney who was looking to dish dirt on Hillary Clinton — then hours later hired a high-powered lawyer.

The president’s eldest son at first dismissed the significance of the sitdown with the Russian, saying he “had to listen” to what she had to say in the middle of the presidential race.

“Obviously I’m the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent . . . went nowhere but had to listen,” Trump Jr. tweeted about his June 9, 2016, meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower.

But he lawyered up later, hiring Alan Futerfas, a New York-based white-collar criminal defense lawyer, to represent him in connection with the FBI’s probe into Russia’s meddling in the election.

Futerfas “regularly defends white-collar professionals, including corporate officers, directors and hedge fund principals, often in highly charged investigative settings,” according to the website SuperLawyer.com.

Futerfas later confirmed he was repping Trump Jr., telling The Post, “He doesn’t have anything to worry about. He didn’t do anything wrong.”

But, he added, everyone else in the administration linked to the investigation had hired a lawyer, so it was “prudent” for Trump Jr. to seek counsel as well.

Lawmakers, including some Republicans, are demanding more answers from Trump Jr.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to grill him and others who were at the meeting, including the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and ex-campaign manager Paul Manafort.

“Happy to work with the committee to pass on what I know,” Trump Jr. responded via Twitter.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said later that there was no collusion between Trump Jr. and Russia.

“The only thing I see inappropriate about the meeting was the people that leaked the information,” she said, adding that the president only learned of the meeting in the past few days.

Meanwhile, Trump Jr. denied that he had offered shifting explanations for why he met with Veselnitskaya.

“No inconsistency in statements, meeting ended up being primarily about adoptions. In response to further Q’s I simply provided more details,” Trump Jr. tweeted about a Sunday New York Times article that reported his different accounts.

His first statement Saturday didn’t mention that the Russian had offered damaging information about Clinton.

A day later, Trump Jr. admitted that Veselnitskaya had offered him dirt on Clinton but that it “became clear that she had no meaningful information.”

Meanwhile, publicist Rob Goldstone confirmed he set up the meeting on behalf of Russian pop singer Emin Agalarov — who once co-starred in a music video with the commander-in-chief himself.

Goldstone said Veselnitskaya told him she had information about illegal campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee that she thought Trump Jr. might find interesting.

President Trump appeared in a music video with Agalarov that was recorded in 2013 while Trump was in Russia for the Miss Universe pageant.

Agalarov is the son of Aras Agalarov, a billionaire Russian real estate mogul with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Goldstone, a music publicist, said he was organizing the get-together on behalf of Russian pop star Emin Agalarov, the son of an oligarch who is a close friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“I can send this info to your father via Rhona, but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first,” Goldstone said in one of the emails.

Trump Jr. defended his actions in Tuesday’s Fox interview, claiming he was just doing “opposition research,” and that he never told his dad about the meeting.

President Trump has previously declared the probe into ties between his campaign and Russia “the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history.”"

President Donald Trump’s eldest son changed his account of the meeting he had with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign over the weekend, saying Sunday that Natalia Veselnitskaya told him she had information about Clinton. A statement from Donald Trump Jr. one day earlier made no mention of Clinton.

Trump watched the final round of the US Women’s Open golf tournament from a high-security tent with son and daughter-in law Eric and Lara Trump.

First lady Melania Trump and her dad joined them late in the afternoon, followed by daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner — just back from the annual summit of media, tech and finance moguls in Sun Valley, Idaho — and their kids.

But Donald Trump Jr. was a no-show amid continuing controversy over his Trump Tower meeting last year with a Russian lawyer and a former Soviet counterintelligence officer.

“If I were Don Jr., I wouldn’t come here either with all the attention he’s getting,” one club member said.

Last week, emails revealed that Trump Jr., Kushner and then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort attended the meeting on the promise of getting political dirt on presidential rival Hillary Clinton.

Trump defended his namesake in an early morning tweet that said: “HillaryClinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?”

Later, he live-tweeted some of the action on the links, writing: “I am at the @USGA #USWomensOpen. An amateur player is co-leading for the first time in many decades — very exciting!”

Amateur Hye-Jin Choi wound up losing to rookie Sung Hyun Park by two strokes, and Trump — who was wearing a trademark red “Make America Great Again” hat — disappointed many in the crowd by leaving without presenting the silver trophy cup.

Trump’s elevated viewing stand, overlooking the 15th and 18th greens, was festooned with star-spangled bunting and equipped with air conditioning, satellite TV and two walls of bulletproof glass.

Nearby, the clubhouse was thronged by members and outsiders who shelled out $650 a head to nosh on caviar rice pilaf, shrimp, monkfish, sliced sirloin steak and lamb gnocchi.

The open bar featured two specialty cocktails for the event: the “Grey Goose 19th Hole” — a highball with equal parts orange and pineapple juices and a splash of Sprite soda — and the “Bacardi Birdie,” made with lemonade and cranberry juice.​"

Speaking to The Post after President Trump’s eldest son released emails Tuesday that documented the lead-up to his sit-down with a Kremlin-connected lawyer, Gingrich said the meeting was “not wise, but it wasn’t illegal.”

“This was not a secret meeting with KGB agents. This was not a James Bond movie. This was three guys who met a lady for a meeting that was so inconsequential, neither [Paul] Manafort, Kushner or Trump Jr. remembered it,” said the former House speaker.

Trump Jr. landed himself in the middle of the ongoing Trump-Russia controversy when he released a series of emails between himself and publicist Rod Goldstone in which they discussed scheduling a meeting with a woman who claimed to have evidence “that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia.”

The information was part of “Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,” Goldstone wrote Trump Jr., who denied any wrongdoing after hiring a criminal defense attorney Monday.

Gingrich, a longtime Trump ally, said coverage of the meeting has been “blown out of proportion [and] tells you a lot about the pathos of the news media right now.”

“It is a disservice to the American nation — the degree of maniacal focus, the gossip-like nature, and the willingness to ignore major problems on behalf of chasing this down,” he said.

Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether associates of the president colluded with Moscow during the election, an investigation Gingrich previously predicted is likely to end with “somebody probably going to jail.”

Gingrich stood by that prediction Tuesday but said the culprit won’t be Trump’s son, who could be charged with an illegal solicitation under campaign finance laws, according to some legal experts.

“He’s actually telling the truth,” Gingrich said of Trump Jr., adding that “Mueller will look for somebody who commits perjury or obstruction of justice.”"

Trump’s eldest son admitted to having a meeting with a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, who had ties to the ​Kremlin in June 2016.

Jay Sekulow, a member of the president’s legal team, blamed the Secret Service for allowing Veselnitskaya into the Trump Tower meeting with the younger Trump, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.

“Well, I wonder why the Secret Service, if this was nefarious, why the Secret Service allowed these people in. The president had Secret Service protection at that point, and that raised a question with me,” Sekulow​ ​said​ ​Sunday on​ ​ABC’s​ ​”This Week.”

President Trump’s oldest son met Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer with links to the Kremlin, at the Trump Tower after she said she had damaging information on Clinton that would be helpful to his father’s campaign.

“Don can’t do any deals, because he’ll be overly scrutinized. He just goes to work every day and is miserable,” People magazine reported, citing a source close to the Trump family.

Unlike his sister, Ivanka, who has an office in the White House, Trump Jr., 39, and his brother Eric, 33, have remained behind in New York to run the Trump Organization, the magazine reported in its latest edition.

And while his father has defended him for meeting with Veselnitskaya, calling him a “good boy,” the pressure among Trump family members to win and never admit failure has devastated Trump Jr., the report said.

“He doesn’t like failure and mistakes, and he doesn’t accept them,” a source who had business dealings with Trump told People. “You have to justify your existence to be in his realm.”

A friend close to the brothers said “loyalty within this family is insane.”

“You can’t bite the hand that feeds you, but he [Don Jr.] can’t wait for these four years to be over ,” the person told the magazine.

The report said the stress of being constantly in the public eye, has Trump Jr. longing for the quiet life at the rustic upstate cabin he, his wife, Vanessa, and their five children escape to on the weekends.

The manager of the Riverside Cafe in Roscoe, NY, said Trump Jr. is a regular.

He said the president’s son is “good people,” doesn’t try to stand out and “never has his hair slicked back like he does on TV.”"

Rob Goldstone says the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, told him she had information about illegal campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee that she thought Donald Trump Jr. might find interesting.

“Once she presented what she had to say, it was like, ‘Can you keep an eye on it? Should [Trump] be in power, maybe that’s a conversation that he may have in the future?’ ” Goldstone told The Washington Post.

Trump appeared in a music video with Goldstone’s client, Emin Agalarov, in 2013. The video was filmed while Trump was in Russia for the Miss Universe pageant.



Agalarov is the 36-year-old son of Aras Agalarov, a billionaire Russian real estate mogul with ties to Putin, according to Politico.

The younger Agalarov recently bragged to Forbes that the president is a close friend of the family’s and had planned on building a Trump Tower in Russia before he decided to run for office.

Trump held the 2013 Miss Universe pageant at one of the Agalarov’s properties, Crocus City Hall in Russia.

At the time, Trump said of the Agalarovs: “One of the great families in Russia is our partner in this endeavor,” according to Politico.

Trump Jr. said Sunday that Veselnitskaya’s claims about Russian donations to Hillary Clinton’s election campaign turned out to be “vague, ambiguous and made no sense.”"

The lobbyist, Rinat Akhmetshin, appeared before special counsel Robert Mueller’s grand jury in recent weeks, according to the Associated Press, citing a source close to the case.

The revelation suggests that Mueller and his team of investigators view the meeting, which came weeks after Donald Trump won the GOP nomination, as potentially important to their probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.

Along with Trump Jr., the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort also attended the sitdown.

Emails released by Trump Jr. show he took the meeting expecting that he would be getting dirt about Hillary Clinton as part of what was described to him as a Russian government effort to help Team Trump.

Reached by the AP, Akhmetshin declined comment. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, also declined comment Wednesday night.

Akhmetshin, an ex-Soviet military officer who served in a counterintelligence unit, is also a well-known Washington lobbyist.

He has been representing Russian interests trying to undermine the story of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Russian prison and is the namesake of a US sanctions law.

Akhmetshin has been reported to have ties to Russian intelligence but he has denied that, calling the allegations a “smear campaign.”

Mueller and his team first signaled their interest in the Trump Tower gathering last month by contacting an attorney for at least some of the Russians who attended.

Trump Jr. has offered evolving explanations for the circumstances of the meeting, initially saying that the purpose was to discuss adoption and later acknowledging that he anticipated receiving information that he thought could be damaging to Clinton.

In addition to Akhmetshin, others present included Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, music publicist Rob Goldstone — who helped arrange the gathering — and a translator.

Ike Kaveladze, who also goes by the name Irakly Kaveladze, also attended the meeting.

Kaveladze works for a Russian developer who partnered with Trump on the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.

An email exchange posted to Twitter by Trump Jr. showed him conversing with Goldstone, who wanted him to meet with someone he described as a “Russian government attorney,” who supposedly had dirt on Clinton as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”

“If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer,” Trump Jr. wrote in one email response.

Another contact between Trump associates and Russia was revealed this week when Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, acknowledged that the Trump Organization was pursuing a Trump Tower real estate complex in Moscow in 2015.

Cohen said he had reached out to a press secretary for Russian President Vladimir Putin about approvals.

In a letter this month to the House intelligence committee, Stephen Ryan, a lawyer for Cohen, dismissed as “false” and “wholly unsubstantiated” claims about Cohen included in a dossier of salacious allegations about the president’s connections with Russia.

The president has repeatedly called the Russia probe a “hoax” and “fake news.”

330,##########,http://nypost.com/2017/07/11/the-key-players-in-the-escalating-trump-jr-email-scandal/,The key players in the escalating Trump Jr. email scandal,['July'],NY Post,"The key players in the escalating Donald Trump Jr. email scandal include a tabloid hack-turned-flack who hobnobs with the czars, a wealthy Azerbaijani pop singer who once belted out Elvis covers in New Jersey and a shadowy Kremlin-connected lawyer.

The central figure is British music publicist Rob Goldstone, a former reporter who helped broker the June 2016 meeting between Trump Jr. and lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.

Goldstone set up the pow-wow on behalf of his client, crooner Emin Agalarov — the son of a billionaire with ties to both Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Trump, and the former son-in-law of Azerbaijani President Illhan Aliyev.

But friends say they don’t think the jovial PR man was trying to personally insert himself into geopolitics — just doing the kind of wheeling and dealing he’s known for.

“He does people favors. That’s what a good PR person does, introducing people to other people,” his client Ivan Wilzig, who also goes by Sir Ivan, told The Post. “He knew the sons of two powerful billionaires and he figured he was doing people a favor.”

The Manchester-born Goldstone worked as a reporter for the Sun and Mirror before moving to Australia and switching teams to public relations, where he repped huge names including Michael Jackson, Cyndi Lauper, Julio Iglesias, James Taylor, BB King and Poison.

Keeping big secrets about celebrities was never easy for a guy who cut his teeth as an entertainment reporter.

“I would go into meetings with a client and they would tell me something and I would think, with my journalist’s hat on, ‘Wow, that is an amazing story,’” he told the Jewish Telegraph in 2015.

“But, of course, as their PR guys, we did not want it to get out.”

Goldstone moved to New York in 1990 and built a similarly star-studded roster, but when the larger-than-life character — he once penned a piece for the New York Times about the difficulties of globetrotting with his 285-pound, 5-foot-7 frame — began representing Emin in 2012, it became a virtually full-time gig.

The 37-year-old crooner may not be a household name in the US, but his baby-faced good looks and Sinatra-in-the-club dance tracks have made him a megastar in Russia, where he performed for 50,000 fans in front of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg last year.

Still, Emin also has strong stateside connections — namely in New Jersey.

The singer spent his teen years in Bergen County, where he launched his music career singing Elvis Presley cover songs at an open mic event in Ridgewood when he was 19 years old.

“The whole school made fun of me because I thought I was the new Russian Elvis in town,” he told the Chicago Tribune of his time at Tenafly High School, where he was a student before attending Marymount Manhattan College.

He later raised his own kids in Alpine, where the family owns a $7 million mansion.

Emin’s oligarch father, Aras, is a close personal friend of Putin, who helped make his dad a very wealthy man — worth at least $1.9 billion, according to Forbes.

And thanks to his home country connections, Aras arranged for Emin to marry the Azerbaijani president’s daughter, with whom he had two kids before they divorced in 2015.

Goldstone had met Donald Trump Sr. through the New York social scene and when his client, model Patricia Velasquez, appeared on “Celebrity Apprentice” in 2012.

But Emin told The Post in a late May interview that he first became close to the future commander-in-chief after he and Goldstone reached out to Trump’s Miss Universe organization while casting a music video.

“[We] wanted to find the most beautiful woman in the world — an international, beautiful woman — and Rob said, ‘Miss Universe,’” he said.

They arranged for then-Miss Universe Olivia Culpo to appear in the video — and the Agalarovs partnered with the Trumps to bring the whole pageant to Moscow in 2013.

“After doing the video, we were invited to Miss USA with my family in Las Vegas, where I met Mr. Trump and we signed a contract to bring [Miss] Universe to Russia,” he said.

The event was supposed to be the first meeting between Trump and Putin, Emin revealed — but that never came to pass.

“We knew that he wanted to meet with Trump. It never worked out because the king of some country was visiting Russia, and that never happened,” he said.

But the Agalarovs, Trumps and Goldstone remained close — both Goldstone and Emin have claimed there was a Trump Tower planned for Moscow that never came to fruition.

As Donald Trump entered the race for the US presidency, both men enthusiastically cheered on his candidacy on social media.

On June 3 last year, Goldstone sent the now-famous emails to Trump Jr., saying Emin wanted him to hook up with a Russian lawyer who had “some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary.”

Exactly how Veselnitskaya, the lawyer, fits into this web remains less clear.

In an interview with NBC Tuesday, she strenuously denied having — or offering — any dirt on Clinton.

“I never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton. It was never my intention to have that,” she told the network.

The 42-year-old attorney does have ties to the Kremlin, however.

The elegant brunette worked for entrepreneur Denis Katsyv, the son of the vice president of the state-owned Russian Railways, to lobby against the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which allowed the US to impose sanctions on Russian officials.

The act is named for Sergei Magnitsky — who died in a Russian prison after he blew the whistle on tax fraud at Denis Katsyv’s company Prevezon Holdings.

A source told the Times of London that Veselnitskaya coordinated her lobbying effort with the office of Yury Chaika, Russia’s prosecutor-general and a Putin ally.

Veselnitskaya says the only reason for her meeting with Trump Jr. — also attended by his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign manager Paul Manafort — was to discuss the act.

“I did not have an assignment from the Kremlin, there were no orders from the government,” she told the Washington Post on Tuesday.

She told the paper the meeting came about when a “friend” offered to introduce her to a “friend” — but she didn’t respond when asked if that friend was Emin.

“I think it was someone who wanted to look like they were a big shot,” she told the paper.

“Goldstone. I think he said he had something very important from the Kremlin to make it look like he is a big deal.”"

The president’s eldest son claimed he was just doing “opposition research” and that he hadn’t told his father about the meeting because “there was nothing to tell.”

“They had something, you know, maybe concrete evidence to all the stories I’d been hearing about … so I think I wanted to hear it out,” Trump Jr. told Fox’s Sean Hannity.

“But really it went nowhere and it was apparent that wasn’t what the meeting was about.”

Trump Jr. was slightly evasive when asked whether he read the emails that said the Clinton dirt was “high level and sensitive information” and “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”

“I didn’t know if there was anything behind it,” he claimed. “I can’t vouch for the information … someone sent me an email! I can’t help what someone sends me.”

Although Trump Jr. was vague about whether he had read the information, the email chain shows he responded “within minutes.”

“If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer,” he wrote in the emails published by the New York Times and tweeted by Trump Jr. himself.

Rinat Akhmetshin, the spy-turned-lobbyist, accompanied attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya to the June 2016 sitdown, NBC News reported Friday.

During the meeting, Akhmetshin said Veselnitskaya provided Trump Jr., details of what she believed were illicit contributions to the DNC and suggested that going public with the dirt could hurt Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

“This could be a good issue to expose how the DNC is accepting bad money,” Akhmetshin recalled her saying, the Associated Press reported.

Akhmetshin said the lawyer, who invited him to attend, had a plastic folder with documents that detailed her claims.

He said he did not know if they were provided by the Kremlin — but that he believes she left the materials with Trump Jr. associates.

Trump Jr. asked the attorney if she had other evidence to back up her claims, including whether she could demonstrate the precise flow of the money.

Veselnitskaya said Team Trump would need to research it more, and after that, Trump Jr. lost interest, according to Akhmetshin.

Trump aides, worried about the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, were shocked by the president’s strategy.

“This was . . . unnecessary,” one adviser told the paper. “Now someone can claim he’s the one who attempted to mislead. Somebody can argue the president is saying he doesn’t want you to say the whole truth.”

Commentators went wild.

What could be more exciting than for the special counsel investigating the Russian matter to team up with noted Trump foe Eric Schneiderman? Neither the president nor Congress can lay a glove on him; some of the legal weapons he wields go beyond what Mueller has at his disposal; and if Schneiderman obtains convictions in state court, Trump will have no pardon power. It’s like two superheroes with coordinating capes and powers!

see also Mueller reportedly teams up with Schneiderman in Manafort probe Special counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly joined forces with New...

Around liberal Twitter, it was a total game changer. “THIS IS BIG!!!!!!” typed Amy Siskind of New Agenda, hailing the sort of news for which four or five exclamation points won’t do. “What’s Russian for ‘Trump’s goose is cooked?’ ” crowed Harvard’s Laurence Tribe

In the opposite camp, the Trumpian claque at Breitbart argued that with the combative New York AG on board — Schneiderman has long feuded with Trump, and is widely disliked by Republicans — the whole Russian probe can be dismissed as tainted. The connection “undermin[es] the integrity and impartiality of Mueller’s inquiry,” wrote Joel Pollak. “There could not be a more inappropriate person to be seen working with Mueller.”

Both sides should calm down. Yes, the cooperation between the feds and New York is an important side of the story. What’s absent is a real indication that much new or unusual is afoot.

Federal and state prosecutors are supposed to cooperate when investigations overlap. That’s what they do. From the little that has been pinned down so far, it’s hard to see that they’re cooperating in any way they wouldn’t be if persons other than Mueller and Schneiderman were in charge.

It’d be one thing had Mueller gone shopping for help to some state with little connection to the Russian affair. But as the locus of the Trump organization and campaign, New York is at the center of the probe, even if other states have connections, too.

We know that the Trump Tower meeting attended by Donald Trump Jr. is a focus of the probe because Rinat Akhmetshin, one of its participants, spent hours recently testifying before Mueller’s grand jury.

As lawyer and commentator Renato Mariotti pointed out on Twitter , federal prosecutors “routinely” provide their state counterparts with evidence of possible crimes committed under state law.

It could hardly be otherwise under our two-level system of prosecution, under which patterns of misbehavior can readily generate both federal and state offenses. Conversely, state law enforcers looking into violations of state law may come upon evidence that federal law has been broken, and they, too, routinely share such information with their federal counterparts.

The US attorneys’ handbook, which Mueller would be expected to follow, provides expressly for sharing federal grand-jury evidence with state and local law enforcement when it points to such crimes. Were Mueller to step down or be fired tomorrow, his successor would be called on to “team up” with state counterparts in this same way.

Let’s review the bidding. In the aftermath of Trump’s pardon of Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio following a federal contempt conviction — which sent ripples of dismay deep into Republican legal circles — a lot of us are looking for reassurance that the chief executive can’t pardon every offense his backers might commit.

And that reassurance is right there in the Constitution, which makes plain that the president has no power to pardon crimes under state law. Nor can he fire state law-enforcement officials like Schneiderman.

It’s believed that part of the Paul Manafort probe (in which Manafort denies all wrongdoing) involves possible violations of money-laundering laws, and other financial charges may surface. Under New York’s unique Martin Act, its attorney general wields unique financial investigatory powers.

As I wrote for these pages in 2011, the Martin Act is a virtual “blank check for the prosecution” that gives New York’s AG “super-broad powers to investigate and press charges against alleged financial fraud.” In particular, he can “subpoena witnesses or demand the production of documents without probable cause or a grand jury’s say-so.” He can also leak things he finds, or keep them private, as suits his whim.

These powers go too far and should be rolled back, but the Schneiderman-Mueller cooperation appears to fall squarely within them.

At least three people with knowledge of the correspondence told the New York Times that the message was sent by publicist Rob Goldstone as he helped arrange the June 2016 meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya.

Trump Jr. admitted Sunday that he was interested in getting the potentially damaging information on Clinton, but gave no indication that he was aware of the Kremlin’s connection to the election.

The email ultimately indicates that the info came straight from the Russians, the Times reported.

“It’s a very serious development,” Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC. “It all warrants thorough investigation. Everyone who was in that meeting ought to come before our committee.”

The email does not elaborate, though, on any other efforts by Moscow officials to help aid the Trump campaign.

There is reportedly no evidence suggesting that the info pertaining to Clinton had anything to do with Russia’s computer hacking of the DNC.

Goldstone’s message is expected to be useful to the Justice Department, which is looking into whether any of President Trump’s associates or aides worked with the Russians to help win him the election.

But Trump Jr.’s lawyer, Alan Futerfas, insists his client did nothing wrong — and that the email is simply “much ado about nothing.”

“During this busy period, Robert Goldstone contacted Don Jr. in an email and suggested that people had information concerning alleged wrongdoing by Democratic Party front-runner Hillary Clinton in her dealings with Russia,” he told the Times on Monday.

“Don Jr.’s takeaway from this communication was that someone had information potentially helpful to the campaign and it was coming from someone he knew,” Futerfas said. “Don Jr. had no knowledge as to what specific information, if any, would be discussed.”

While it is unclear whether Goldstone knew where the damaging material about Clinton came from, one source who was briefed on the emails told the Times it appeared that he had passed along info that he had received from others.

Trump Jr. has claimed on Twitter that he was simply hearing out potentially damaging info about a political opponent when he brokered the sit-down with Veselnitskaya.

President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was also at the meeting, along with campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

Trump Jr. lawyered up on Monday in the wake of the controversy. Both Veselnitskaya and the Kremlin have claimed that she was in no way acting for the Russian government."

The Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. denied having any dirt on Hillary Clinton — or ties to the Kremlin — in a new interview Tuesday.

“I never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton. It was never my intention to have that,” Natalia Veselnitskaya told NBC News.

Veselnitskaya said she met with the president’s eldest son in June 2016 to discuss the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which allowed the US to impose sanctions on Russian officials over human rights violations.

In retaliation to the act, Russia banned Americans from adopting Russian children — a move that soured the relationship between Moscow and Washington.

Trump Jr. was told by a middle man ahead of the meeting that Veselnitskaya had potentially damaging information on his dad’s opponent — and that it was part of the Kremlin’s effort to help the Trump campaign, the New York Times reported Monday night.

But the lawyer denied that she had — or promised — any intel.

“It is quite possible that maybe they were longing for such an information,” Veselnitskaya said. “They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted.”

Trump Jr. has said Veselnitskaya offered intel on Clinton but that it “became clear that she had no meaningful information.”

Instead, he claimed, Veselnitskaya — who’s built a career advocating for the Russian government — pushed the country’s adoption policy during their conversation.

Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his son-in-law-turned-advisor Jared Kushner also attended the meeting, Veselnitskaya confirmed.

Veselnitskaya added that she’s having a hard time adjusting to being thrust into the spotlight.

“Imagine yourself in my shoes. One morning you wake up and all of a sudden you are the focus of all the high ranking, upstream media of the world,” she said. “To summarize, those were not the happiest days of my life, I have to say. I have to break up my holiday. I have to take a trip back to Moscow because I just wanted to be able to answer the questions myself.”"

“Let me be very clear: I did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so,” Kushner said in a rare public appearance outside the White House after a nearly three-hour closed-door meeting with the Senate intelligence committee.

“I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds for my businesses. And I have been fully transparent in providing all requested information.”

Just after the meeting, a smiling Kushner told reporters that he answered all questions asked and it went “very well.”

On Tuesday, he’ll face a grilling from House investigators who are leading their own investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

Kushner chalked up President Trump’s election victory to the way he ran his campaign, not Russian influence.

“Donald Trump had a better message and ran a smarter campaign and that is why he won,” the former real-estate developer said.

“Suggesting otherwise ridicules those who voted for him.”

Ahead of his testimony to Senate staffers, which was not made under oath, Kushner released an 11-page statement, in which he outlined four meetings with Russian representatives during the campaign and transition period.

As for the controversial June 2016 meeting with Russian-American attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya — which was arranged by his brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr. — Kushner said that it was a “waste of time” and that he tried to leave after 10 minutes.

“When I got there, the person who has since been identified as a Russian attorney was talking about the issue of a ban on US adoptions of Russian children,” he said, adding that he had arrived late to the sit-down.

“Reviewing e-mails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time and that, in looking for a polite way to leave and get back to my work, I actually e-mailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for 10 or so minutes and wrote, ‘Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting.’ ”

Kushner also recalled a meeting with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at Trump Tower in December 2016, saying they discussed the Syrian confict and the desire to improve US-Russian relations. “I did not suggest an ongoing secret form of communication for then or for when the administration took office,” he said.

“I did not raise the possibility of using the embassy or any other Russian facility for any purpose other than this one possible conversation in the transition period.”

Kushner also met with Russian banker Sergey Gorkov on Dec. 13 but “no specific policies were discussed,” he said."

Surely, no high-level government official in American history has been on the verge of ouster so early and so often. Being the subject of shake-up rumors is practically Reince Priebus job description. If he’d been fired every time the possibility had been raised in the press, he’d be the Billy Martin — the legendary oft-fired and re-hired Yankees manager — of the Trump administration.

Priebus isn’t the only one. You don’t truly qualify as part of the Trump team unless the president has vented about how woefully you are failing him. Trump may imagine himself surrounded by incompetents and wreckers, but the sabotage of his White House is an inside job that reaches to the very top.

Consider the Russia bombshell. It’d be nice if Trump could distance himself from the instantly infamous meeting with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya by ruthlessly throwing his erstwhile campaign staff under the bus.

But two of three Trump officials at the meeting were family, including his son, who brokered the confab, and his son-in-law, whom Trump has put in charge of a swath of the American government.

Short of that, perhaps Trump could punish the White House spinners who crafted a witlessly misleading statement upon the publication of the initial New York Times story about the meeting. Except the president himself was involved in its drafting.

This is why, as always, the finger-pointing at Reince Priebus — and the rest of the staff — is a misdirection. No one will mistake Priebus for, say, James Baker, Ronald Reagan’s supremely effective chief of staff. But Trump doesn’t want a James Baker, who would unduly constrain him.

And everyone knows that it’s not Priebus coming up with the cracked ideas that keep Trump from finding his footing.

These are things that Trump’s chief of staff definitely hasn’t said:

“Sir, we had a successful trip to Europe for the G-20 summit, but I have just the idea to cap it off. A US-Russia cybersecurity unit — an impenetrable one. People will love it!”

“Hey, you really want to yank that nut-job Comey’s chain? Tell him he’d better hope there aren’t tapes of your conversations with him. That will drive him crazy, and I mean, what could he possibly do to retaliate?”

“Mr. President, I’ve noticed that your coverage on ‘Morning Joe’ hasn’t been so great. I recommend a couple of tweets and strongly believe, sir, that you should make them as repugnant as possible. Let’s take it to the next level.”

President Trump could parachute into a White House staffed by literally the best and the brightest, abiding by a crisp organization chart and armed with a carefully considered policy agenda. And immediately the place would be swamped by needless controversies, tangled lines of authority and policy confusion. All these things don’t emanate from below, but from the top.

The last week or so shows the opportunity that Trump is missing. The unhinged reaction to Trump’s Warsaw speech spoke to how far left the Democrats have gone and how Trump could occupy the political center — if only he could exercise some self-control.

Not a lot, only a little. Enough, to put it bluntly, to show up and read his lines and otherwise shut up. Reince Priebus never would have been elected president, but he could do a better job at this elementary task than the president himself. He could be forgiven for occasionally musing about firing Trump rather than the other way around.

Regardless, Trump will continue to step on his team’s message, advertise his worst instincts on Twitter and make whatever might still be lurking out there on Russia worse with robustly counter-productive counter-punching. And he’ll do it no matter who is, in Trump’s mind, the manifestly unsuited and failing White House chief-of-staff."

Rinat Akhmetshin confirmed his participation to The Associated Press.

He said the sit down with Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and current White House senior adviser, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort was “not substantive.”

He said he “actually expected more serious” discussion.

“I never thought this would be such a big deal to be honest,” he told The AP about the meeting, which has roiled the Trump administration.

Asked about Akhmetshin and his role in the June 2016 meeting, Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, told reporters Friday: “We don’t know anything about this person.”

The meeting heightened questions about whether Trump’s campaign coordinated with the Kremlin during the election, which is the focus of federal and congressional probes.

Trump Jr. has posted emails this week detailing an associate’s plans for the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, to meet with Trump Jr. to pass on compromising information about the Democratic candidate.

The associate — music publicist Rob Goldstone — stated clearly that the discussion was part of a Russian government effort to help the GOP candidate.

Trump Jr. has confirmed that Veselnitskaya attended the meeting, but he did not disclose Akhmetshin’s presence.

The president’s son has tried to discount the meeting, saying he did not receive the information he was promised during the brief encounter.

Meanwhile, House Democrats are renewing calls for a vote on an independent commission to investigate Russia’s election meddling and ties to Team Trump.

Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California also said that Kushner’s security clearance should be revoked.

Pelosi and other top House Democrats spoke at a news conference Friday insisting they would try to force votes on the issue on the House floor — although their ability to do so is limited.

Pelosi said that “House Democrats are not going to let the Republicans off the hook for their complicity … They have become enablers of the violations of our Constitution, the attack on the integrity of our elections.”

She added that “House Republicans will have to answer for their actions.”

Russian lawyer was let into US without a visa by Obama administration

The Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower to dish dirt on Hillary Clinton was let into the country by the Justice Department under the Obama administration without a visa.

Natalia Veselnitskaya entered the US in late 2015 under “extraordinary circumstances,” The Hill reported.

The news site said she was granted a “special immigration parole” by the feds to help defend a client under criminal investigation.

At the time, Veselnitskaya was representing a Russian businessman, Denis Katsyv, who was being investigated by the Justice Department for alleged money laundering.

The US charged Katsyv’s company Prevezon Holdings as part of a $230 million tax fraud case, which was settled for $6 million in May.

The US Attorney’s Office in New York confirmed that it let Veselnitskaya into the country on a grant of immigration parole from October 2015 to early January 2016.

The Justice and State departments could not explain how she was still in the US in June 2016 for the meeting with Trump Jr., which was also attended by Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, the website reported."

Donald Trump Jr. admitted having a sit-down with Natalia Veselnitskaya,​ ​a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin, in June 2016, ​a meeting ​that also included former campaign manager Paul Manafort and the president’s son-in-law ​​Jared Kushner.

“The meeting that took place is not illegal,” attorney Jay Sekulow said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

“The president wasn’t aware of the meeting, did not participate in the meeting, did not attend the meeting.”

Sekulow then faced off with CNN’s Chris Cuomo in a heated half-hour exchange, as the host pressed the lawyer to admit it was at least “inappropriate” for Trump Jr. to agree to a meeting where he was told he’d get dirt on Hillary Clinton via the Kremlin to help his dad’s campaign.

But the attorney wouldn’t bite, instead trying to turn the subject to allegations that the Democrats received their own intel from the Ukraine, President Obama’s handling of Russian hacking — and former FBI chief James Comey leaking details of his conversations with President Trump to the press.

“That’s immaterial to our conversation!” Cuomo fumed.

Sekulow insisted it wasn’t, claiming Trump’s campaign wouldn’t be under scrutiny for ties to Russia in the first place if Comey hadn’t blabbed.

The attorney stood by statements from lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya that “nothing happened” at the meeting with Don Jr. anyway, and that she was only there to discuss US sanctions on Russian officials.

“[That] also gets you into the same basket of inappropriate conversations, because if she’s working on behalf of Russia to get rid of sanctions, that’s a similarly sensitive situation,” Cuomo said.

“You’re reading into a conversation you have no evidence of nor knowledge of,” Sekulow responded.

“You’re doing the same thing,” Cuomo fired back. “The idea that the person who is alleged to be an agent of the Kremlin saying ‘no I’m not’ and you banking on that is a little absurd.”

“It’s not a legal issue,” was Sekulow’s only response."

Somehow, the money Manafort told US authorities he earned in 2012 and 2013 from Ukraine’s Party of Regions exceeded what the party said was its entire operating budget, The New York Times said.

Manaford collected $17 million from working for the party, which was led by Vladimir Putin ally Victor Yanukovych. Manafort reported the sum in a Department of Justice filing in June.

But in reports filed with the Ukraine government, the now-defunct Party of Regions reported total expenses of just $15 million in 2012 and 2013 — less than the sum Manafort collected.

Yanukovych won election as Ukraine’s prime minister in 2010. He fled to Russia in 2014 amid accusations of corruption, vote-rigging and police abuse.

The current Ukrainian government accuses Yanukovych of stealing $1 billion from the national treasury, and in May put him in trial in abstentia for treason. The trial was adjourned on Wednesday and will resume in August.

Manafort’s work for Yanukovych included lobbying the U.S. government to influence its Ukraine policy and establishing a pro-Yanukovych nonprofit in Washington, D.C.

“Any questions about the reporting obligations of the Party of Regions should be directed to those within the party responsible for such reporting,” said Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni.

“Just last month Ukraine officials indicated that there is no proof of illicit payments” to Manafort, Maloni said.

Manafort resigned from the Trump campaign last August after weeks of revelations about his longstanding ties to Yanukovych and other Putin allies.

Manafort was reported last week to have participated in the June 2016 meeting between President Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, and others. Trump Jr. hoped the confab wuld result in damaging dirt on Hillary Clinton’s own ties to Russia.

Trump administration officials hope to tamp down some of the furor over the ever-spiraling Russian scandal by sending Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow to appear on all five Sunday-morning news shows to try to put a lid on the ever-spiraling Russia scandal.

Expect Sekuklow to contend Trump Jr. did nothing illegal by setting up the meeting, and Trump’s other campaign aides did nothing illegal by attending.

“What statute is being violated here?” Sekuklow asked on CNN on Friday. “This is interesting, and I understand why you’re covering it. But the fact is — no legal violation for the meeting. The meeting itself is not a violation of the law.”

The White House announced Saturday that Ty Cobb, a veteran D.C. attorney, will join his legal team as a special counsel.

Cobb will oversee the administration’s “war room” to respond to the ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Bloomberg reported Friday."

“No inconsistency in statements, meeting ended up being primarily about adoptions. In response to further Q’s I simply provided more details,” Trump Jr. tweeted about a Sunday New York Times article that reported the shifting explanations.

The president’s eldest son met on June 9, 2016, at Trump Tower with Natalia Veselnitskaya after he was told by a pal that the Kremlin-connected attorney was offering damaging information about Clinton.

His first statement Saturday didn’t mention that the Russian had offered information about the former first lady.

“It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared [Kushner] and Paul [Manafort] to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up,” he said.

But on Sunday, Trump Jr. admitted that Veselnitskaya had offered him dirt on Clinton, but that her statements were “vague, ambiguous and made no sense” and that it “became clear that she had no meaningful information.”

Trump Jr. also defended his decision to go after the negative info in a tweet posted Monday.

“Obviously I’m the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent… went nowhere but had to listen,” he sarcastically tweeted.

Also Monday, Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway told “Good Morning America” that “no information was received that was meaningful or helpful” during Trump Jr.’s meeting.

“There’s no evidence of collusion” between Team Trump and Russia in the campaign, Conway added.

ABC’s George Stephanopoulos fired back that Trump Jr. was clearly expecting to get damaging information.

“Isn’t that at minimum an attempt at collusion?” Stephanopoulos asked.

“Are you saying there’s evidence of collusion because everybody is trying to convert wishful thinking into hard evidence and haven’t been able to do that,” Conway replied.

Stephanopoulos also asked her about her previous statements that there were no meetings between Trump associates and the Russians.

“Why did the administration allow those denials to stand for so many months?” he asked.

“Some of the disclosure forms have been amended since that time to reflect other meetings,” including the meeting Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort had with Veselnitskaya, she said.

Conway also went on CNN to repeat her denials that collusion had taken place.

“Don Jr. has very explicitly stated he didn’t even know the name of the person with whom he was meeting,” she said. “He agreed to the meeting based on a contact from the Miss Universe Pageant.”

“They get into the meeting and it quickly turns into a pretext for Russian adoption, according to his statements, that the comments this woman is making about any type of information on Hillary Clinton were vague. They were meaningless.”

But host Chris Cuomo pointed out that despite his denials, “He changed his story twice. You talked about being in a court of law — not good when you change your story,” Cuomo said.

“There are big implications when you change your story like this. Whether or not it was good information, Kellyanne, doesn’t mean it was a smart move to take a meeting with a Russian-connected person who was going to give you negative information about your opponent.

NBC News reported Friday that the unnamed former officer – a Russian-American lobbyist — is suspected by some US officials of having continuing ties to Russian intelligence.

The lobbyist accompanied the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, to the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower attended by Trump Jr., President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, the former chairman of the Trump campaign.

The former Soviet official – who denies any current connections to Russian spy agencies — served in the Soviet military and moved to the US, where he holds dual citizenship, NBC News reported.

Veselnitskaya acknowledged to NBC News that she was accompanied by at least one other man, but she declined to name him.

Reps for Kushner and Manafort declined to comment when reached by NBC News. A lawyer for Trump Jr. also did not respond to several requests for comment.

Trump Jr. eagerly agreed to meet Veselnitskaya, who he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have compromising information about Clinton as part of the Kremlin’s support for his father, according to emails Trump’s eldest son released this week.

Veselnitskaya told NBC that she has no connections to the Kremlin and insisted the meeting with Team Trump was to discuss sanctions, not the presidential campaign.

Congress and special counsel Robert Mueller are conducting separate probes into Russia’s meddling and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.

The June 2016 meeting was arranged between Trump Jr. and music publicist Rob Goldstone, who has ties to Russia.

In an email exchange released by Trump Jr., he wrote “I love it” when told about possibly getting his hands on potentially damaging material about the Clinton campaign.

Goldstone told Trump Jr. that the sit down would be with a “Russian government attorney” and that the information was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”

Trump Jr. later said in an interview on Fox News that, “in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently.”

The president has defended his son’s decision to meet with Veselnitskaya, saying “most people would have taken that meeting.”

“My son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer but a Russian lawyer,” Trump said Thursday.

“From a practical standpoint most people would have taken that meeting. It’s called opposition research or research into your opponent,” he added."

Asked if he knew that his son was meeting with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June last year, Trump said in a White House interview: “No, that I didn’t know until a couple of days ago when I heard about this.”

Trump Jr. eagerly agreed to meet the woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have dirt on Hillary Clinton as part of the Kremlin’s support for his father, according to emails Trump’s eldest son released on Tuesday.

In the interview, Trump said he did not fault his son for holding the meeting.

“I think many people would have held that meeting,” the president told the news service.

The emails were the strongest evidence that Team Trump Trump welcomed Russia’s help to win the election.

Congress and special counsel Robert Mueller are conducting separate probes into Russia’s meddling and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.

Trump also said he directly asked Russian strongman Vladimir Putin if he was involved in what US intelligence says was Russian interference, and that Putin denied it.

Trump said he spent the first 25 minutes or so of his more than two-hour meeting with Putin last Friday in Germany on the election meddling subject.

“I said, did you do it? And he said no, I did not. Absolutely not. I then asked him a second time in a totally different way. He said absolutely not,” Trump said."

STATEMENT OF JARED C. KUSHNER TO CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES

July 24, 2017

I am voluntarily providing this statement, submitting documents, and sitting for interviews in order to shed light on issues that have been raised about my role in the Trump for President Campaign and during the transition period.

I am not a person who has sought the spotlight. First in my business and now in public service, I have worked on achieving goals, and have left it to others to work on media and public perception. Because there has been a great deal of conjecture, speculation, and inaccurate information about me, I am grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight.

My Role in the Trump for President Campaign

Before joining the administration, I worked in the private sector, building and managing companies. My experience was in business, not politics, and it was not my initial intent to play a large role in my father-in-law’s campaign when he decided to run for President.

However, as the campaign progressed, I was called on to assist with various tasks and aspects of the campaign, and took on more and more responsibility.

Over the course of the primaries and general election campaign, my role continued to evolve. I ultimately worked with the finance, scheduling, communications, speechwriting, polling, data and digital teams, as well as becoming a point of contact for foreign government officials.

All of these were tasks that I had never performed on a campaign previously. When I was faced with a new challenge, I would reach out to contacts, ask advice, find the right person to manage the specific challenge, and work with that person to develop and execute a plan of action. I was lucky to work with some incredibly talented people along the way, all of whom made significant contributions toward the campaign’s ultimate success. Our nimble culture allowed us to adjust to the ever-changing circumstances and make changes on the fly as the situation warranted. I share this information because these actions should be viewed through the lens of a fast-paced campaign with thousands of meetings and interactions, some of which were impactful and memorable and many of which were not.

It is also important to note that a campaign’s success starts with its message and its messenger. Donald Trump had the right vision for America and delivered his message perfectly. The results speak for themselves. Not only did President Trump defeat sixteen skilled and experienced primary opponents and win the presidency; he did so spending a fraction of what his opponent spent in the general election. He outworked his opponent and ran one of the best campaigns in history using both modern technology and traditional methods to bring his message to the American people.

Campaign Contacts with Foreign Persons

When it became apparent that my father-in-law was going to be the Republican nominee for President, as normally happens, a number of officials from foreign countries attempted to reach out to the campaign. My father-in-law asked me to be a point of contact with these foreign countries. These were not contacts that I initiated, but, over the course of the campaign, I had incoming contacts with people from approximately 15 countries. To put these requests in context, I must have received thousands of calls, letters and emails from people looking to talk or meet on a variety of issues and topics, including hundreds from outside the United States. While I could not be responsive to everyone, I tried to be respectful of any foreign government contacts with whom it would be important to maintain an ongoing, productive working relationship were the candidate to prevail. To that end, I called on a variety of people with deep experience, such as Dr. Henry Kissinger, for advice on policy for the candidate, which countries/representatives with which the campaign should engage, and what messaging would resonate. In addition, it was typical for me to receive 200 or more emails a day during the campaign. I did not have the time to read every one, especially long emails from unknown senders or email chains to which I was added at some later point in the exchange.

With respect to my contacts with Russia or Russian representatives during the campaign, there were hardly any. The first that I can recall was at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. in April 2016. This was when then candidate Trump was delivering a major foreign policy speech. Doing the event and speech had been my idea, and I oversaw its execution. I arrived at the hotel early to make sure all logistics were in order. After that, I stopped into the reception to thank the host of the event, Dimitri Simes, the publisher of the bi-monthly foreign policy magazine, The National Interest, who had done a great job putting everything together. Mr. Simes and his group had created the guest list and extended the invitations for the event. He introduced me to several guests, among them four ambassadors, including Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. With all the ambassadors, including Mr. Kislyak, we shook hands, exchanged brief pleasantries and I thanked them for attending the event and said I hoped they would like candidate Trump’s speech and his ideas for a fresh approach to America’s foreign policy. The ambassadors also expressed interest in creating a positive relationship should we win the election. Each exchange lasted less than a minute; some gave me their business cards and invited me to lunch at their embassies. I never took them up on any of these invitations and that was the extent of the interactions.

Reuters news service has reported that I had two calls with Ambassador Kislyak at some time between April and November of 2016. While I participated in thousands of calls during this period, I do not recall any such calls with the Russian Ambassador. We have reviewed the phone records available to us and have not been able to identify any calls to any number we know to be associated with Ambassador Kislyak and I am highly skeptical these calls took place. A comprehensive review of my land line and cell phone records from the time does not reveal those calls. I had no ongoing relationship with the Ambassador before the election, and had limited knowledge about him then. In fact, on November 9, the day after the election, I could not even remember the name of the Russian Ambassador. When the campaign received an email purporting to be an official note of congratulations from President Putin, I was asked how we could verify it was real. To do so I thought the best way would be to ask the only contact I recalled meeting from the Russian government, which was the Ambassador I had met months earlier, so I sent an email asking Mr. Simes, “What is the name of the Russian ambassador?” Through my lawyer, I have asked Reuters to provide the dates on which the calls supposedly occurred or the phone number at which I supposedly reached, or was reached by, Ambassador Kislyak. The journalist refused to provide any corroborating evidence that they occurred.

The only other Russian contact during the campaign is one I did not recall at all until I was reviewing documents and emails in response to congressional requests for information. In June 2016, my brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr. asked if I was free to stop by a meeting on June 9 at 3:00 p.m. The campaign was headquartered in the same building as his office in Trump Tower, and it was common for each of us to swing by the other’s meetings when requested. He eventually sent me his own email changing the time of the meeting to 4:00 p.m. That email was on top of a long back and forth that I did not read at the time. As I did with most emails when I was working remotely, I quickly reviewed on my iPhone the relevant message that the meeting would occur at 4:00 PM at his office. Documents confirm my memory that this was calendared as “Meeting: Don Jr.| Jared Kushner.” No one else was mentioned.

I arrived at the meeting a little late. When I got there, the person who has since been identified as a Russian attorney was talking about the issue of a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children. I had no idea why that topic was being raised and quickly determined that my time was not well-spent at this meeting. Reviewing emails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time and that, in looking for a polite way to leave and get back to my work, I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for ten or so minutes and wrote “Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting.” I had not met the attorney before the meeting nor spoken with her since. I thought nothing more of this short meeting until it came to my attention recently. I did not read or recall this email exchange before it was shown to me by my lawyers when reviewing documents for submission to the committees. No part of the meeting I attended included anything about the campaign, there was no follow up to the meeting that I am aware of, I do not recall how many people were there (or their names), and I have no knowledge of any documents being offered or accepted. Finally, after seeing the email, I disclosed this meeting prior to it being reported in the press on a supplement to my security clearance form, even if that was not required as meeting the definitions of the form.

There was one more possible contact that I will note. On October 30, 2016, I received a random email from the screenname “Guccifer400.” This email, which I interpreted as a hoax, was an extortion attempt and threatened to reveal candidate Trump’s tax returns and demanded that we send him 52 bitcoins in exchange for not publishing that information. I brought the email to the attention of a U.S. Secret Service agent on the plane we were all travelling on and asked what he thought. He advised me to ignore it and not to reply — which is what I did. The sender never contacted me again.

To the best of my recollection, these were the full extent of contacts I had during the campaign with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian government.

Transition Contacts with Foreign Persons

The transition period after the election was even more active than the campaign. Starting on election night, we began to receive an incredible volume of messages and invitations from well-wishers in the United States and abroad. Dozens of messages came from foreign officials seeking to set up foreign leader calls and create lines of communication and relationships with what would be the new administration. During this period, I recall having over fifty contacts with people from over fifteen countries. Two of those meetings were with Russians, neither of which I solicited.

On November 16, 2016, my assistant received a request for a meeting from the Russian Ambassador. As I mentioned before, previous to receiving this request, I could not even recall the Russian Ambassador’s name, and had to ask for the name of the individual I had seen at the Mayflower Hotel almost seven months earlier. In addition, far from being urgent, that meeting was not set up for two weeks — on December 1. The meeting occurred in Trump Tower, where we had our transition office, and lasted twenty- thirty minutes. Lt. General Michael Flynn (Ret.), who became the President’s National Security Advisor, also attended. During the meeting, after pleasantries were exchanged, as I had done in many of the meetings I had and would have with foreign officials, I stated our desire for a fresh start in relations. Also, as I had done in other meetings with foreign officials, I asked Ambassador Kislyak if he would identify the best person (whether the Ambassador or someone else) with whom to have direct discussions and who had contact with his President. The fact that I was asking about ways to start a dialogue after Election Day should of course be viewed as strong evidence that I was not aware of one that existed before Election Day.

The Ambassador expressed similar sentiments about relations, and then said he especially wanted to address U.S. policy in Syria, and that he wanted to convey information from what he called his “generals.” He said he wanted to provide information that would help inform the new administration. He said the generals could not easily come to the U.S. to convey this information and he asked if there was a secure line in the transition office to conduct a conversation. General Flynn or I explained that there were no such lines. I believed developing a thoughtful approach on Syria was a very high priority given the ongoing humanitarian crisis, and I asked if they had an existing communications channel at his embassy we could use where they would be comfortable transmitting the information they wanted to relay to General Flynn. The Ambassador said that would not be possible and so we all agreed that we would receive this information after the Inauguration. Nothing else occurred. I did not suggest a “secret back channel.” I did not suggest an on-going secret form of communication for then or for when the administration took office. I did not raise the possibility of using the embassy or any other Russian facility for any purpose other than this one possible conversation in the transition period. We did not discuss sanctions.

Approximately a week later, on December 6, the Embassy asked if I could meet with the Ambassador on December 7. I declined. They then asked if I could meet on December 6; I declined again. They then asked when the earliest was that I could meet. I declined these requests because I was working on many other responsibilities for the transition. He asked if he could meet my assistant instead and, to avoid offending the Ambassador, I agreed. He did so on December 12. My assistant reported that the Ambassador had requested that I meet with a person named Sergey Gorkov who he said was a banker and someone with a direct line to the Russian President who could give insight into how Putin was viewing the new administration and best ways to work together. I agreed to meet Mr. Gorkov because the Ambassador has been so insistent, said he had a direct relationship with the President, and because Mr. Gorkov was only in New York for a couple days. I made room on my schedule for the meeting that occurred the next day, on December 13.

The meeting with Mr. Gorkov lasted twenty to twenty-five minutes. He introduced himself and gave me two gifts — one was a piece of art from Nvgorod, the village where my grandparents were from in Belarus, and the other was a bag of dirt from that same village. (Any notion that I tried to conceal this meeting or that I took it thinking it was in my capacity as a businessman is false. In fact, I gave my assistant these gifts to formally register them with the transition office). After that, he told me a little about his bank and made some statements about the Russian economy. He said that he was friendly with President Putin, expressed disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for a better relationship in the future. As I did at the meeting with Ambassador Kislyak, I expressed the same sentiments I had with other foreign officials I met. There were no specific policies discussed. We had no discussion about the sanctions imposed by the Obama Administration. At no time was there any discussion about my companies, business transactions, real estate projects, loans, banking arrangements or any private business of any kind. At the end of the short meeting, we thanked each other and I went on to other meetings. I did not know or have any contact with Mr. Gorkov before that meeting, and I have had no reason to connect with him since.

To the best of my recollection, these were the only two contacts I had during the transition with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian government.

Disclosure of Contacts on My Security Clearance Form

There has been a good deal of misinformation reported about my SF-86 form. As my attorneys and I have previously explained, my SF-86 application was prematurely submitted due to a miscommunication and initially did not list any contacts (not just with Russians) with foreign government officials. Here are some facts about that form and the efforts I have made to supplement it.

In the week before the Inauguration, amid the scramble of finalizing the unwinding of my involvement from my company, moving my family to Washington, completing the paper work to divest assets and resign from my outside positions and complete my security and financial disclosure forms, people at my New York office were helping me find the information, organize it, review it and put it into the electronic form. They sent an email to my assistant in Washington, communicating that the changes to one particular section were complete; my assistant interpreted that message as meaning that the entire form was completed. At that point, the form was a rough draft and still had many omissions including not listing any foreign government contacts and even omitted the address of my father-in-law (which was obviously well known). Because of this miscommunication, my assistant submitted the draft on January 18, 2017.

That evening, when we realized the form had been submitted prematurely, we informed the transition team that we needed to make changes and additions to the form. The very next day, January 19, 2017, we submitted supplemental information to the transition, which confirmed receipt and said they would immediately transmit it to the FBI. The supplement disclosed that I had “numerous contacts with foreign officials” and that we were going through my records to provide an accurate and complete list. I provided a list of those contacts in the normal course, before my background investigation interview and prior to any inquiries or media reports about my form.

It has been reported that my submission omitted only contacts with Russians. That is not the case. In the accidental early submission of the form, all foreign contacts were omitted. The supplemental information later disclosed over one hundred contacts from more than twenty countries that might be responsive to the questions on the form. These included meetings with individuals such as Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Israel’s Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, Mexico’s Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Luis Videgaray Caso and many more. All of these had been left off before.

Over the last six months, I have made every effort to provide the FBI with whatever information is needed to investigate my background. In addition, my attorneys have explained that the security clearance process is one in which supplements are expected and invited. The form itself instructs that, during the interview, the information in the document can be “update[d], clarif[ied], and explain[ed]” as part of the security clearance process. A good example is the June 9 meeting. For reasons that should be clear from the explanation of that meeting I have provided, I did not remember the meeting and certainly did not remember it as one with anyone who had to be included on an SF-86. When documents reviewed for production in connection with committee requests reminded me that meeting had occurred, and because of the language in the email chain that I then read for the first time, I included that meeting on a supplement. I did so even though my attorneys were unable to conclude that the Russian lawyer was a representative of any foreign country and thus fell outside the scope of the form. This supplemental information was also provided voluntarily, well prior to any media inquiries, reporting or request for this information, and it was done soon after I was reminded of the meeting. **

As I have said from the very first media inquiry, I am happy to share information with the investigating bodies. I have shown today that I am willing to do so and will continue to cooperate as I have nothing to hide. As I indicated, I know there has been a great deal of speculation and conjecture about my contacts with any officials or people from Russia. I have disclosed these contacts and described them as fully as I can recall. The record and documents I am providing will show that I had perhaps four contacts with Russian representatives out of thousands during the campaign and transition, none of which were impactful in any way to the election or particularly memorable. I am very grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight. I also have tried to provide context for my role in the campaign, and I am proud of the candidate that we supported, of the campaign that we ran, and the victory that we achieved.

It has been my practice not to appear in the media or leak information in my own defense. I have tried to focus on the important work at hand and serve this President and this country to the best of my abilities. I hope that through my answers to questions, written statements and documents I have now been able to demonstrate the entirety of my limited contacts with Russian representatives during the campaign and transition. I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government. I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector. I have tried to be fully transparent with regard to the filing of my SF-86 form, above and beyond what is required. Hopefully, this puts these matters to rest."

Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Kremlin-linked attorney, was shopping a story about hedge fund manager William Browder and Ziff Brothers Investments, which had invested with Browder, Bloomberg News reported.

Russian authorities were going after the investors in a fraud investigation, and Browder and at least one member of the Ziff family had given money to the Clinton Global Initiative.

Veselnitskaya, the news service reported, thought that amounted to a scandal that would hurt Clinton politically.

But the amounts were so miniscule and were so well known that the supposed dirt she wanted to dish likely would have had little effect on her candidacy, besieged as it was in the summer of 2016 by the release of hacked DNC emails and controversy over her private email server.

Browder’s firm, Hermitage Capital, was listed as a contributor of $10,000 to $25,000 to the Clinton Global Initiative because he paid to attend a conference sponsored by the group about a decade ago.

Ziff Brothers’ Daniel Ziff is recorded as contributing $50,000 to $100,000 to CGI, a former arm of the Clinton Foundation.

Browder, who had been in Russia pushing for greater transparency in its financial sector, was kicked out of the country in 2005, and then tried in absentia and convicted of tax fraud in 2013. No charges were ever filed against the Ziffs.

It’s unclear if the information about the investors came up when Veselnitskaya met with Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort during a June 2016 sitdown at Trump Tower, a meeting now under investigation by Congress and special counsel Robert Mueller.

Trump Jr. on Tuesday released an email chain of messages he exchanged with British-born music promoter Rob Goldstone, who wanted to arrange the meeting with the Russian lawyer, who has worked for Moscow’s regional government and Kremlin officials.

Offered dirt on the former first lady, Trump Jr. repled “I love it,” and never alerted authorities about the effort to interfere in the election by a foreign government.

Browder will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee at a hearing next week on Veselnitskaya’s links to the Russian government, The Daily Beast reported.

Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former CIA spook who headed the agency’s European directorate of operations, said she had to be working on behalf of the Kremlin, a charge she has denied.

“Russian intelligence’s practice is to co-opt such a person by arming them with secret intelligence information and tasking them to pass it to Trump’s people and get their reaction,” he wrote on Just Security, a website devoted to national security issues.

“The key point is that essentially no Russian citizen or lawyer has compromising material on Hillary Clinton which has not been supplied to them from Russian intelligence,” he wrote.

“The simple assertion that she had such information is tantamount to declaring that Veselnitskaya was acting as agent of Russian government in this particular role.”"

Speaking during a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump called Donald Trump Jr. “a wonderful young man” who was just hoping to get “opposition research” that was being offered.

“He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer. Not a government lawyer, but a Russian lawyer. It was a short meeting. It was a meeting that went very, very quickly. Very fast,” he said.

“Most people would have taken that meeting. It’s called opposition research, or even research into your opponent.”

The president said “many people” have called him with negative information dirt on his political opponents — including Clinton.

“I’ve had many people call up, ‘Oh, gee, we have information on this factor or this person,’ or frankly, Hillary. That’s very standard in politics. Politics is not the nicest business in the world, but it’s very standard, where they have information and you take the information.”

He then said that “zero” happened during the meeting and slammed the media.

“I think the press made a very big deal over something that really a lot of people would do,” he said.

Trump ducked a question about a comment from Christopher Wray, his nominee to be FBI director, who told a Senate Committee Wednesday that anyone who had been approached by a foreign national about meddling in a domestic political campaign should have contacted the FBI.

And he took a shot at ex-Attorney General Loretta Lynch for allowing the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, to enter the US without a visa in 2015 to represent a defendant in a tax fraud trial.

“Somebody said that her visa or her passport to come into the country was approved by Attorney General Lynch. I was a little surprised to hear that,” he said.

At the time, Veselnitskaya was representing a Russian businessman, Denis Katsyv, who was being investigated by the Justice Department for alleged money laundering.

The US charged Katsyv’s company Prevezon Holdings as part of a $230 million tax fraud case, which was settled for $6 million in May by Trump’s Justice Department.

Trump and Macron said they also talked about terrorism, trade, the Paris Climate Accords and other subjects during what both described as a friendly meeting."

“Fox News Channel’s Hannity will present an exclusive in-studio interview tonight with Donald Trump Jr. to discuss the latest New York Times report and meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya, along with his thoughts on the media,” FNC announced.

Earlier Tuesday, Trump Jr. took an aggressive step to get ahead of the New York Times in this quickly developing story of his meeting, during Dad’s campaign, with a Kremlin-connected lawyer promising to deliver dirt on Hillary Clinton. Donald Jr. sent a tweeted statement to “everyone” and released what he claims is his entire email chain with the publicist for a Russian pop star who set up the Trump Tower meeting in June of 2016. The emails, back and forth with Rob Goldstone, set up the Trump Tower meeting between Natalia Veselnitskaya and Donald Trump Jr. also attended by Jared Kushner and then Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. The New York Times has been writing about the meeting, and setting the TV news cycle, since last weekend."

Chris Christie said Sunday that Donald Trump Jr’s meeting with a Russian lawyer was a “bad idea” but he trusts Special Counsel Robert Mueller to give Team Trump a fair shake.

“Bob Mueller is a good man, in my experience with dealing with him when he was director of the FBI and I was U.S. attorney,” Christie told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “And I trust that he will be very careful to try not to go on a fishing expedition. There’s always a temptation to do that. I hope that that’s not what he does.”

One interaction Mueller and congressional investigators are probing is Trump Jr’s meeting with a Russian lawyer during the presidential campaign that was billed as a chance to get dirt on Hillary Clinton from the Kremlin.

“I think that everybody, in retrospect, knows this was a bad idea,” Christie said of the Trump Tower meeting.

Emails revealed that Trump Jr. was excited about the June 2016 meeting and welcomed a chance to get damaging information on his father’s opponent. But Junior said the actual meeting was a waste of time because the Russian lawyer never produced any opposition research.

President Trump helped craft a misleading statement about the nature of his son’s meeting, the Washington Post reported.

“Let’s not jump ahead of ourselves,” Christie cautioned about the president’s involvement. “We don’t know that the president knew about those e-mails or about the content of those e-mails. And so we don’t know what his own son told him about that meeting.”

President Trump and his allies have blasted Mueller’s Russian probe as a witch hunt and have sought to discredit his expanding probe.

Mueller reportedly convened a grand jury for his investigation.

Christie said the grand jury is a “normal step” and needed to issue subpoenas.

“That’s a typical thing to be done in any investigation,” Christie said.

But Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intel Committee, said Mueller’s grand jury is a “significant development.”

“That wouldn’t be taking place if there was really no evidence, no evidentiary basis to move forward,” Schiff told CNN’s “State of the Union.”

To protect Mueller’s investigation, a pair of bipartisan lawmakers — Sens. Thom Tillis and Chris Coons — introduced legislation to allow special counsels to seek legal recourse if they are dismissed.

The bill is retroactive to May 17, when Mueller was named special counsel to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and potential Team Trump collusion.

Asked if the bill was directed at President Trump, Tillis (R-NC.) didn’t hide his concern. “There’s no question that it is because clearly, the date that we’ve made the bill retroactive to,” he told “Fox News Sunday.”

Tillis said Mueller should be allowed to complete his investigation and have a “definitive answer” on Russia’s influence. “I don’t believe the investigation is a witch hunt,” Tillis said."

“There is no possible way anybody at the White House could be seriously thinking about firing Mueller,” said Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, a staunch supporter of President Trump.

“I don’t even want to comment on that, because that’s so far out of bounds it couldn’t possibly be a serious discussion.”

White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said again on Friday that while the president has the power to fire Mueller, he has no intention of doing so at this time.

Mueller, meanwhile, has asked the White House to preserve all documents related to the meeting that Donald Trump Jr., Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and former campaign manager Paul Manafort had with a Russian lawyer, it was reported Friday.

Mueller sent what is called “a document preservation request,” asking that Team Trump save “any subjects discussed in the course of the June 2016 meeting” and also “any decisions made regarding the recent disclosures about the June 2016 meeting,” CNN reported.

Trump Jr. arranged the sit-down after Natalia Veselnitskaya approached him through an intermediary offering dirt on Hillary Clinton that came from the Russian government.

Also Friday, Reuters reported that Veselnitskaya represented Russia’s top spy agency, the Federal Security Service, in a land dispute in Moscow.

The FSB, successor to the Soviet-era KGB service, was headed by Vladimir Putin before he became Russia’s president.

Veselnitskaya insists that she is a private lawyer and has never obtained damaging information about Clinton.

Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Kremlin, has said she had “nothing whatsoever to do with us.”"

“The statement Donald Jr. issued is true. The president weighed in as any father would do with the little information he had,” said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

Her comments come in response to a Washington Post report that said the president dictated a statement for his son in response to a report that he met with a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin during the campaign in June 2016.

The statement, crafted on Air Force One as Trump and his advisers returned from June’s G-20 summit in Germany, confirmed the Trump Tower meeting, but said what they discussed was “not a campaign issue.” Trump’s lawyer, Jay Sekulow, said repeatedly that the president had nothing to do with Trump Jr.’s statement.

But days after the New York Times revealed the meeting, Trump Jr. released an email chain showing he agreed to meet with Natalia Veselnitskaya because she said she had dirt on Hillary Clinton that would be helpful to his father.

“This is all discussion, frankly, of no consequence,” Huckabee Sanders said. “There was no follow up, it was disclosed to the proper parties, which is how the New York Times found out about it to begin with. The Democrats want to continue to use this as a PR stunt and are doing everything they can to keep this story alive.”"

Kaine told reporters that while there is no proof of any legal wrongdoing, the investigation into potential ties between the Trump campaign and the Russians has become a ""treason investigation.""

""Nothing is proven yet. But we're beyond obstruction of justice in terms of what's being investigated,"" Kaine said. ""This is moving into perjury, false statements, and even into potentially treason.""

""To meet with an adversary to try to get information to hijack democracy. The investigation is now more than just obstruction of justice in investigation. It's more than just a perjury investigation. It's a treason investigation,"" the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee continued.

""We don't know the answer to the question yet. An investigation is not that same as ultimately something that's going to lead to charges but that's what this investigation is.""

Kaine's comments come a day after the New York Times reported Trump Jr. received an email warning him potential material being floated to him to harm Hillary Clinton's campaign was part of the Russian government's push to aide his father's campaign.

Initially, Trump Jr. said the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was to discuss Russian adoption in the U.S., which Russian President Vladimir Putin put an end to due to the Magnitsky Act putting sanctions on Russian human rights abusers. But, the Times reported on Sunday that Trump Jr. was under the impression Veselnitskaya had potentially damaging information on Clinton.

Veselnitskaya was allowed into the U.S. through a legal loophole, allowing her to accompany a colleague who was testifying in a House committee hearing about Russian policy.

A new report by The Hill indicates how she used the U.S. immigration system to enter the country and engage in nonofficial business while stateside, including a private meeting with President Trump's campaign.

Five days after meeting with Donald Trump Jr., former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and now-White House senior adviser Jared Kushner in New York City last June, Veselnitskaya was spotted sitting in the front row at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Russia policy.

The lawyer also attended a movie screening at the Newseum, just up the street from the U.S. Capitol. The film called into question the Magnitsky Act, which imposes sanctions against Russia for human and political rights violations, and which Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he opposes.

Veselnitskaya appeared at a dinner on Capitol Hill where Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., and approximately 20 other guests talked about the movie and Russian policy.

Rohrabacher said on Wednesday that he believed she was there to lobby other lawmakers about reversing the law so Americans could adopt Russian children."

In 2008, Browder's lawyer Sergei Magnitsky discovered a $230 million corruption scheme by numerous Russian officials. The Magnitsky Act was passed by Congress in response to this corruption scheme. One of the lawyers who worked hard to overturn the Magnitsky Act was Natala Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. in June 2016 claiming she had dirt on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

Testimony of William Browder to the Senate Judiciary Committee on FARA violations connected to the anti-Magnitsky Campaign by Russian government interests

July 26, 2017

Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein and members of the committee, thank you for giving me the opportunity to testify today on the Russian government's attempts to repeal the Magnitsky Act in Washington in 2016, and the enablers who conducted this campaign in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, by not disclosing their roles as agents for foreign interests.

Before I get into the actions of the agents who conducted the anti-Magnitsky campaign in Washington for the benefit of the Russian state, let me share a bit of background about Sergei Magnitsky and myself.

I am the founder and CEO of Hermitage Capital Management. I grew up in Chicago, but for the last 28 years I've lived in Moscow and London, and am now a British citizen. From 1996 to 2005, my firm, Hermitage Capital, was one of the largest investment advisers in Russia with more than $4 billion invested in Russian stocks.

Russia has a well-known reputation for corruption; unfortunately, I discovered that it was far worse than many had thought. While working in Moscow I learned that Russian oligarchs stole from shareholders, which included the fund I advised. Consequently, I had an interest in fighting this endemic corruption, so my firm started doing detailed research on exactly how the oligarchs stole the vast amounts of money that they did. When we were finished with our research we would share it with the domestic and international media.

For a time this naming and shaming campaign worked remarkably well and led to less corruption and increased share prices in the companies we invested in. Why? Because President Vladimir Putin and I shared the same set of enemies. When Putin was first elected in 2000 he found that the oligarchs had misappropriated much of the president's power as well. They stole power from him while stealing money from my investors. In Russia your enemy's enemy is your friend, and even though I've never met Putin, he would often step into my battles with the oligarchs and crack down on them.

That all changed in July 2003 when Putin arrested Russia's biggest oligarch and richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Putin grabbed Khodorkovsky off his private jet, took him back to Moscow, put him on trial and allowed television cameras to film Khodorkovsky sitting in a cage right in the middle of the courtroom. That image was extremely powerful because none of the other oligarchs wanted to be in the same position. After Khodorkovsky's conviction the other oligarchs went to Putin and asked him what they needed to do to avoid sitting in the same cage as Khodorkovsky. From what followed, it appeared that Putin's answer was, ""Fifty per cent."" He wasn't saying 50% for the Russian government or the presidential administration of Russia, but 50% for Vladimir Putin personally. From that moment on Putin became the biggest oligarch in Russia and the richest man in the world, and my anti-corruption activities would no longer be tolerated.

The results of this change came very quickly. On November 13th, 2005 as I was flying into Moscow from a weekend away, I was stopped at Sheremetyevo airport, detained for 15 hours, deported and declared a threat to national security.

Eighteen months after my expulsion a pair of simultaneous raids took place in Moscow. Over 25 Interior Ministry officials barged into my Moscow office and the office of the American law firm that represented me. The officials seized all the corporate documents connected to the investment holding companies of the funds that I advised. I didn't know the purpose of these raids so I hired the smartest Russian lawyer I knew, a 35-year old named Sergei Magnitsky. I asked Sergei to investigate the purpose of the raids and try to stop whatever illegal plans these officials had.

Sergei went out and investigated. He came back with the most astounding conclusion of corporate identity theft: the documents seized by the Interior Ministry were used to fraudulently re-register our Russian investment holding companies to a man named Viktor Markelov, a known criminal convicted of manslaughter. After more digging, Sergei discovered that the stolen companies were used by the perpetrators to misappropriate $230 million of taxes that our companies had paid to the Russian government in the previous year.

I had always thought Putin was a nationalist. It seemed inconceivable that he would approve of his officials stealing $230 million from the Russian state. Sergei and I were sure that this was a rogue operation and if we just brought it to the attention of the Russian authorities, the ""good guys"" would get the ""bad guys"" and that would be the end of the story.

We filed criminal complaints with every law enforcement agency in Russia, and Sergei gave sworn testimony to the Russian State Investigative Committee (Russia's FBI) about the involvement of officials in this crime.

However, instead of arresting the people who committed the crime, Sergei was arrested. Who took him? The same officials he had testified against. On November 24, 2008 they came to his home, handcuffed him in front of his family, and threw him into pre-trial detention.

Sergei's captors immediately started putting pressure on him to withdraw his testimony. They put him in cells with 14 inmates and eight beds, leaving the lights on 24 hours a day to impose sleep deprivation. They put him in cells with no heat and no windowpanes and he nearly froze to death. They put him in cells with no toilet, just a hole in the floor and sewage bubbling up. They moved him from cell to cell in the middle of the night without any warning. During his 358 days in detention he was forcibly moved multiple times.

They did all of this because they wanted him to withdraw his testimony against the corrupt Interior Ministry officials, and to sign a false statement that he was the one who stole the $230 million — and that he had done so on my instruction.

Sergei refused. In spite of the grave pain they inflicted upon him, he would not perjure himself or bear false witness.

After six months of this mistreatment Sergei's health seriously deteriorated. He developed severe abdominal pains, he lost 40 pounds, and he was diagnosed with pancreatitis and gallstones and prescribed an operation for August 2009. However, the operation never occurred. A week before he was due to have surgery, he was moved to a maximum security prison called Butyrka, which is considered to be one of the harshest prisons in Russia. Most significantly for Sergei there were no medical facilities there to treat his medical conditions.

At Butyrka his health completely broke down. He was in agonizing pain. He and his lawyers wrote 20 desperate requests for medical attention, filing them with every branch of the Russian criminal justice system. All of those requests were either ignored or explicitly denied in writing.

After more than three months of untreated pancreatitis and gallstones, Sergei Magnitsky went into critical condition. The Butyrka authorities did not want to have responsibility for him, so they put him in an ambulance and sent him to another prison that had medical facilities. But when he arrived there, instead of putting him in the emergency room they put him in an isolation cell, chained him to a bed, and eight riot guards came in and beat him with rubber batons.

That night he was found dead on the cell floor.

Sergei Magnitsky died on November 16, 2009 at the age of 37, leaving a wife and two children.

I received the news of his death early the next morning. It was by far the most shocking, heart-breaking and life-changing news I've ever received.

Sergei Magnitsky was murdered as my proxy. If Sergei had not been my lawyer, he would still be alive today.

That morning I made a vow to Sergei's memory, to his family and to myself that I would seek justice and create consequences for the people who murdered him. For the last seven and a half years I've devoted my life to this cause.

Even though this case was characterized by injustice all the way through, the circumstances of Sergei's torture and death were so extreme that I was sure some people would be prosecuted. Unlike other deaths in Russian prisons, which are largely undocumented, Sergei had written everything down. In his 358 days in detention, Sergei wrote over 400 complaints detailing his abuse. In those complaints he described who did what to him, as well as where, how, when and why. He was able to pass his hand-written complaints to his lawyers, who dutifully filed them with the Russian authorities. Although his complaints were either ignored or rejected, copies of them were retained. As a result, we have the most well documented case of human rights abuse coming out of Russia in the last 35 years.

When I began the campaign for justice with this evidence, I thought that the Russian authorities would have no choice but to prosecute at least some of the officials involved in Sergei Magnitsky's torture and murder. It turns out I could not have been more wrong. Instead of prosecuting, the Russian authorities circled the wagons and exonerated everybody involved. They even went so far as to offer promotions and state honors to those most complicit in Sergei's persecution.

It became obvious that if I was going to get any justice for Sergei Magnitsky, I was going to have to find it outside of Russia.

But how does one get justice in the West for a murder that took place in Russia? Criminal justice is based on jurisdiction: one cannot prosecute someone in New York for a murder committed in Moscow. As I thought about it, the murder of Sergei Magnitsky was done to cover up the theft of $230 million from the Russian Treasury. I knew that the people who stole that money wouldn't keep it in Russia. As easily as they stole the money it could be stolen from them. These people keep their ill-gotten gains in the West, where property rights and rule of law exist. This led to the idea of freezing their assets and banning their visas here in the West. It would not be true justice but it would be much better than the total impunity they enjoyed.

In 2010, I travelled to Washington and told Sergei Magnitsky's story to Senators Benjamin Cardin and John McCain. They were both shocked and appalled and proposed a new piece of legislation called The Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act. This would freeze assets and ban visas for those who killed Sergei as well as other Russians involved in serious human rights abuse.

Despite the White House's desire to re-set relations with Russia at the time, this case shined a bright light on the criminality and impunity of the Putin regime and persuaded Congress that something needed to be done. In November 2012 the Magnitsky Act passed the House of Representatives by 364 to 43 votes and later the Senate 92 to 4 votes. On December 14, 2012 President Obama signed the Sergei Magnitsky Act into law.

Putin was furious. Looking for ways to retaliate against American interests, he settled on the most sadistic and evil option of all: banning the adoption of Russian orphans by American families.

This was particularly heinous because of the effect it had on the orphans. Russia did not allow the adoption of healthy children, just sick ones. In spite of this, American families came with big hearts and open arms, taking in children with HIV, Down syndrome, Spina Bifida and other serious ailments. They brought them to America, nursed them, cared for them and loved them. Since the Russian orphanage system did not have the resources to look after these children, many of those unlucky enough to remain in Russia would die before their 18th birthday. In practical terms, this meant that Vladimir Putin sentenced his own, most vulnerable and sick Russian orphans to death in order to protect corrupt officials in his regime.

Why did Vladimir Putin take such a drastic and malicious step?

For two reasons. First, since 2012 it's emerged that Vladimir Putin was a beneficiary of the stolen $230 million that Sergei Magnitsky exposed. Recent revelations from the Panama Papers have shown that Putin's closest childhood friend, Sergei Roldugin, a famous cellist, received $2 billion of funds from Russian oligarchs and the Russian state. It's commonly understood that Mr. Roldugin received this money as an agent of Vladimir Putin. Information from the Panama Papers also links some money from the crime that Sergei Magnitsky discovered and exposed to Sergei Roldugin. Based on the language of the Magnitsky Act, this would make Putin personally subject to Magnitsky sanctions.

This is particularly worrying for Putin because he is one of the richest men in the world. I estimate that he has accumulated $200 billion of ill-gotten gains from these types of operations over his 17 years in power. He keeps his money in the West and all of his money in the West is potentially exposed to asset freezes and confiscation. Therefore, he has a significant and very personal interest in finding a way to get rid of the Magnitsky sanctions.

The second reason why Putin reacted so badly to the passage of the Magnitsky Act is that it destroys the promise of impunity he's given to all of his corrupt officials.

There are approximately ten thousand officials in Russia working for Putin who are given instructions to kill, torture, kidnap, extort money from people and seize their property. Before the Magnitsky Act, Putin could guarantee them impunity and this system of illegal wealth accumulation worked smoothly. However, after the passage of the Magnitsky Act, Putin's guarantee disappeared. The Magnitsky Act created real consequences outside of Russia and this created a real problem for Putin and his system of kleptocracy.

For these reasons, Putin has stated publicly that it was among his top foreign policy priorities to repeal the Magnitsky Act and to prevent it from spreading to other countries. Since its passage in 2012, the Putin regime has gone after everybody who has been advocating for the Magnitsky Act.

One of my main partners in this effort was Boris Nemtsov. Boris testified in front of the US Congress, the European Parliament, the Canadian Parliament and others to make the point that the Magnitsky Act was a ""pro-Russian"" piece of legislation because it narrowly targeted corrupt officials and not the Russian people. In 2015 Boris Nemtsov was murdered on the bridge in front of the Kremlin.

Boris Nemtsov's protégé, Vladimir Kara-Murza, also travelled to law-making bodies around the world to make a similar case. After Alexander Bastrykin, the head of the Russian Investigative Committee, was added to the Magnitsky List in December of 2016, Vladimir was poisoned. He suffered multiple organ failure, went into a coma and barely survived.

The lawyer who represented Sergei Magnitsky's mother, Nikolai Gorokhov, has spent the last six years fighting for justice. This spring, the night before he was due in court to testify about the state cover up of Sergei Magnitsky's murder, he was thrown off the fourth floor of his apartment building. Thankfully he survived and has carried on in the fight for justice.

I've received many death threats from Russia. The most notable one came from Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in 2013. When asked by a group of journalists about the death of Sergei Magnitsky, Medvedev replied, ""It's too bad that Sergei Magnitsky is dead and Bill Browder is still alive and free."" I've received numerous other death threats from Russian sources through text messages, emails and voicemails. US government sources have warned me about a planned Russian rendition against me. These threats were in addition to numerous unsuccessful attempts that the Russian government has made to arrest me using Interpol or other formal legal assistance channels.

The Russian government has also used its resources and assets to try to repeal the Magnitsky Act. One of the most shocking attempts took place in the spring and summer of last year when a group of Russians went on a lobbying campaign in Washington to try to repeal the Magnitsky Act by changing the narrative of what had happened to Sergei. According to them, Sergei wasn't murdered and he wasn't a whistle-blower, and the Magnitsky Act was based on a false set of facts. They used this story to try to have Sergei's name taken off of the Global Magnitsky Act that passed in December 2016. They were unsuccessful.

Who was this group of Russians acting on behalf of the Russian state? Two men named Pyotr and Denis Katsyv, a woman named Natalia Veselnitskaya, and a large group of American lobbyists, all of whom are described below.

Pyotr Katsyv, father to Denis Katsyv, is a senior Russian government official and well-placed member of the Putin regime; Denis Katsyv was caught by US law enforcement using proceeds from the crime that Sergei Magnitsky uncovered to purchase high-end Manhattan real estate (the case recently settled with the Katsyv's paying $6 million to the US government). Natalia Veselnitskaya was their lawyer.

In addition to working on the Katsyv' s money laundering defense, Ms. Veselnitskaya also headed the aforementioned lobbying campaign to repeal the Magnitsky Act. She hired a number of lobbyists, public relations executives, lawyers and investigators to assist her in this task.

Her first step was to set up a fake NGO that would ostensibly promote Russian adoptions, although it quickly became clear that the NGO's sole purpose was to repeal the Magnitsky Act. This NGO was called the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation (HRAGI). It was registered as a corporation in Delaware with two employees on February 18, 2016. HRAGI was used to pay Washington lobbyists and other agents for the anti-Magnitsky campaign. (HRAGI now seems to be defunct, with taxes due.)

Through HRAGI, Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet intelligence officer naturalised as an American citizen, was hired to lead the Magnitsky repeal effort. Mr Akhmetshin has been involved in a number of similar campaigns where he's been accused of various unethical and potentially illegal actions like computer hacking.

Veselnitskaya also instructed US law firm Baker Hostetler and their Washington, DC-based partner Marc Cymrot to lobby members of Congress to support an amendment taking Sergei Magnitsky's name off the Global Magnitsky Act. Mr. Cymrot was in contact with Paul Behrends, a congressional staffer on the House Foreign Affairs Committee at the time, as part of the anti-Magnitsky lobbying campaign.

Veselnitskaya, through Baker Hostetler, hired Glenn Simpson of the firm Fusion GPS to conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of congressional hearings on the Global Magnitsky Act. He contacted a number of major newspapers and other publications to spread false information that Sergei Magnitsky was not murdered, was not a whistle-blower and was instead a criminal. They also spread false information that my presentations to lawmakers around the world were untrue.

As part of Veselnitskaya's lobbying, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, Chris Cooper of the Potomac Group, was hired to organise the Washington, DC-based premiere of a fake documentary about Sergei Magnitsky and myself. This was one the best examples of Putin's propaganda.

They hired Howard Schweitzer of Cozzen O'Connor Public Strategies and former Congressman Ronald Dellums to lobby members of Congress on Capitol Hill to repeal the Magnitsky Act and to remove Sergei's name from the Global Magnitsky bill.

On June 13, 2016 they funded a major event at the Newseum to show their fake documentary, inviting representatives of Congress and the State Department to attend.

While they were conducting these operations in Washington, DC, at no time did they indicate that they were acting on behalf of Russian government interests nor did they file disclosures under the Foreign Agent Registration Act.

United States law is very explicit that those acting on behalf of foreign governments and their interests must register under FARA so that there is transparency about their interests and their motives.

Since none of these people registered, my firm wrote to the Department of Justice in July, 2016 and presented the facts.

I hope that my story will help you understand the methods of Russian operatives in Washington and how they use US enablers to achieve major foreign policy goals without disclosing those interests. I also hope that this story and others like it may lead to a change in the FARA enforcement regime in the future.

Thank you."

Donald Trump Jr., former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya on June 9, 2016, after Trump Jr. was promised damaging information on Hillary Clinton.

At least three others were also in the meeting, which was orchestrated by a British publicist, Rob Goldstone, who worked with the Trump family in the past.

According to emails exchanged between Trump Jr. and Goldstone, Goldstone told the president's eldest son that the information on Clinton was part of the Russian government's efforts to aid Trump's candidacy during the 2016 presidential campaign.

News of the grand jury subpoenas, reported by Reuters, comes after the Wall Street Journal reported that Robert Mueller, the special counsel overseeing the investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russian officials, has impaneled a federal grand jury to look into Russia's involvement in the 2016 election.

In a statement, Ty Cobb, special counsel to the president, said he didn't know Mueller began using a grand jury.

""Grand jury matters are typically secret,"" Cobb said. ""The White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly. ... The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.""

Kaveladze is a senior vice president at Crocus Group, the real estate development company Azerbaijani-Russian oligarch Aras Agalarov oversees. Agalarov has employed Kaveladze since 2004, well before the Trump Organization partnered with them on the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.

""The eighth person has been identified by prosecutors and we are cooperating fully with prosecutors as a result of the investigation,"" the unnamed person's attorney, Scott Balber, told CNN.

Goldstone wooed Trump Jr. to take the meeting with the promise of negative information on his father's then-presidential opponent Hillary Clinton.

While records from the meeting have not emerged, the Trump associates have claimed Veselnitskaya did not present any opposition research on Clinton and pivoted to lobbying for the reversal of the Magnitsky Act."

The ""Crown prosecutor"" of Russia, Goldstone wrote, wants to provide some ""official documents and information"" to the Trump campaign that would ""incriminate"" Hillary Clinton ""and her dealings with Russia"" and would be ""very useful to your father,"" because giving the Trump campaign the ""obviously very high level and sensitive"" information was ""part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.""

The pitch seemed almost a parody of Democratic charges of Trump-Russia collusion. And yet Trump Jr. bought it. ""If it's what you say I love it,"" he wrote back to Goldstone.

Later, when it all came out, Trump Jr. conceded he might have handled the situation better. But he didn't admit much error. ""I can't help what someone sends me,"" Trump Jr. told Fox News' Sean Hannity Tuesday night. ""I read it, I responded accordingly.""

What a mess for the White House. And all for nothing. When the meeting actually happened, at Trump Tower on June 9, there was a reason Jared Kushner left after a few minutes and Paul Manafort spent the whole time staring at his phone. The ""Crown prosecutor"" of Russia — there is no such position — was actually a shady lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, who had no ""official documents"" to offer but wanted to harangue Trump Jr. about U.S. sanctions on Russia. Trump Jr. quite reasonably saw there was nothing there and cut the meeting off after about 20 minutes.

But in a capital consumed with Trump and Russia, the revelations, first reported in the New York Times and then substantiated by Trump Jr. himself, blew up into the Scandal That Ate Cable TV.

Fortunately for the White House, some Democrats got so excited they accused TrumpWorld of treason, which cooler heads saw as a silly charge, but which allowed Trump defenders to point to bad-faith overreach on the part of the president's adversaries. When observers got to talking about what laws, if any, might have been broken in the Trump Jr.-Veselnitskaya meeting, the list was less spectacular, and even that was a reach.

""The public facts about this meeting suggest that one of several crimes may have occurred, including conspiracy to steal trade secrets (one way to characterize theft of Democratic National Committee emails), conspiracy to take unlawful foreign contributions, or conspiracy to commit some other election-related offense,"" wrote Georgetown University adjunct law professor Phillip Carter in Slate Tuesday.

Maybe that's right, and maybe not. In any event, that question is now, as Sen. Marco Rubio said Tuesday, ""in the Mueller territory.""

But all the talk of treason and Trump being ""willing to accept help from a hostile foreign power"" — the words of a tweet from the Democratic National Committee — did raise the question of whether the current state of affairs in the Trump-Russia investigation has any precedent.

Republicans were quick to point to a Politico story from January — it never really caught on — describing an effort by the government of Ukraine to sabotage the Trump campaign. ""Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office,"" Politico's Ken Vogel and David Stern reported. ""They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton's allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers, a Politico investigation found.""

The covert Ukrainian campaign had some effect — it helped forced Trump to fire his campaign chief, Manafort, in a shakeup that made a difficult August even more difficult — but has generated about one-millionth the interest that Russia's meddling has produced.

But even if Trump Jr.'s actions somehow broke federal election laws — Norm Eisen, the former Obama White House ethics chief, tweeted that the Trump Jr. meeting ""clearly violates campaign finance law and likely implicates Don Jr. and campaign under conspiracy statute"" — the general hyperventilation suggested some in Washington had forgotten that foreign meddling, with American acquiescence, has happened in previous presidential elections.

Had they forgotten the representatives of foreign powers who weighed in on Bill Clinton's behalf in the 1996 election? Anyone remember Yah-lin ""Charlie"" Trie? Or Johnny Chung? Or John Huang? James Riady? Maria Shia?

Do they remember Chung — he was the one who in the pre-farecard era said the Clinton White House was like a subway because you had to put in a coin to open the gate — testified before the House of Representatives that the head of Chinese military intelligence told him: ""We like your president very much. We hope to see him re-elected. I'll give you 300,000 U.S. dollars. You can give it to your president and the Democratic Party.""

Foreign influence in the 1996 election was a scandal. But Clinton's attorney general steadfastly refused to call for an independent counsel in the case, which in that dawn-of-cable-TV-wars time helped keep outrage at manageable levels until Clinton was impeached for something else.

Now the talk in Washington is again all about foreign influence. In the Trump Jr. matter, it seems possible that if the Veselnitskaya meeting was a one-off, and that Trump Jr. learned a lesson and did not repeat his mistake, then the controversy will eventually fade. ""There isn't anything else there,"" he told Hannity. But if that's not true, if there were other similar incidents, who knows?

On Tuesday, the New York Post published an editorial with the headline ""Donald Trump Jr. Is An Idiot."" That was a little blunt. But it did help explain the otherwise inexplicable events of June 2016."

Veselnitskaya, however, was granted parole to enter the U.S. sometime in 2015, Grassley said, but her parole status expired Jan. 7, 2016.

The lawyer told the Washington Post in an interview Tuesday that she has no connection to the Kremlin.

371,##########,http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/byron-york-democrats-want-to-know-whos-behind-trump-dossier/article/2629953?platform=hootsuite,Byron York: Democrats want to know who's behind Trump dossier,['Tony Dejak'],Washington Examiner,"There's been a stark partisan divide over the Trump dossier — the collection of ""salacious and unverified"" allegations about Donald Trump (the words are former FBI Director James Comey's) that was reportedly gathered by Trump's opponents, and later by the FBI itself, in both the Republican primaries and the general election.

Republicans believe the dossier is a key part of the Trump Russia story — after all, it involves a foreign intelligence agent (former MI6 agent Christopher Steele) digging dirt on Trump from Russians with possible ties to President Vladimir Putin. Democrats have not been very interested, preferring to focus on possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and/or possible presidential obstruction of the collusion investigation.

Now, however, Republicans are heartened to hear Democrats expressing interest in learning just how the dossier came into being. It happened Thursday at the sometimes-dry Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

The witness was William Browder, the businessman who crusaded for passage of the Magnitsky Act, which imposed sanctions on Russia after the killing of an anti-corruption lawyer. The sanctions enraged Putin, who retaliated by blocking American adoption of Russian babies. Putin also retaliated by launching a campaign to undermine and ultimately repeal the Magnitsky Act.

Among the Russians who took part in that campaign were Natalia Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akmetshin, who just happened to attend the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump, Jr. But the larger effort was organized by the American firm Fusion GPS, which denies any role in the Trump Tower meeting but was a big part of the anti-Magnitsky Act campaign.

""Veselnitskaya, through [the law firm] Baker Hostetler, hired [former Wall Street Journal reporter] Glenn Simpson of the firm Fusion GPS to conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of congressional hearings on the Global Magnitsky Act,"" Browder testified. ""He contacted a number of major newspapers and other publications to spread false information that Sergei Magnitsky was not murdered, was not a whistle-blower and was instead a criminal.""

Browder was clear that he believed Russians paid Fusion GPS to conduct the anti-Magnitsky Act campaign. And of course, Fusion GPS was also behind the Trump Dossier. And that left Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham with lots of questions.

""The group that did the dossier on President Trump hired this British spy, wound up getting it to the FBI. You believe they were working for the Russians?""

""In the spring and summer of 2016 they were receiving money indirectly from a senior Russian government official,"" Browder answered.

""Okay,"" said Graham. ""So, these are the people that were trying to undermine Donald Trump by showing the nefarious ties to Russia, is that what you are saying?""

""Well, what I'm saying with 100 percent certainty is that they were working to undermine the Magnitsky Act and the timing of that,"" Browder said.

What's important to remember from that exchange is that Browder said ""with 100 percent certainty,"" that Russians financed, or helped finance, the Fusion GPS anti-Magnitsky Act campaign. But Browder could not say who funded the Fusion GPS work on the Trump Dossier.

And that, apparently, piqued the interest of Democratic senators.

""Fusion GPS is a firm that does opposition research for clients,"" Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said. ""In your case, they took on Russian interests as a client and the task was to apply pressure and opposition research and so forth, and to try to undo or defeat the Magnitsky Act?""

""That's correct,"" said Browder.

""With respect to Fusion GPS having commissioned the Steele dossier, do you know who the client was for that particular task?""

""I do not.""

""OK, so you have no evidence that the Russians were involved in commissioning that particular document?""

""No.""

So Browder could not tie Fusion GPS and the Trump dossier to Russian funding and support. But what heartened Republicans was that Whitehouse asked the question. If Democrats want to know who commissioned and financed the Trump dossier, it might be much easier for the Judiciary Committee to find out.

And not just Whitehouse. Democratic Sen. Richard Durbin also appeared curious about who was behind the dossier.

""The Steele dossier is something I'm trying to understand as it relates to Fusion GPS,"" Durbin said. ""Could you put that in perspective as to their role and what that dossier, why it was created and what the people who created it hoped to achieve?""

Browder answered that he only knew the Steele story from what he read in the press, ""so I'm just a bystander on that part of the story.""

""What I am absolutely familiar with on a first-hand basis is Fusion GPS and Glenn Simpson's role working on behalf of the Russian government to overturn the Magnitsky Act,"" Browder continued. ""And there I think the steps they took very much compromised their integrity.""

""But you're saying you don't know of any connection between Fusion GPS and the actual creation or dissemination or use of the Steele dossier?"" Durbin asked.

""I do not,"" Browder said.

Again, the good news for Republicans was not that Browder could enlighten the committee on the Trump dossier. He couldn't. The good news was the Democrats finally showed some interest in learning how the dossier came into being.

That could be particularly important when Simpson, who has in recent weeks refused to testify before the committee and vowed to assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, finally sits down with committee investigators in a private, transcribed interview. Simpson has so far stonewalled all questions about who commissioned and financed the dossier. But Thursday's developments give Republicans some hope they will someday learn the answer."

Trump Jr. admitted Veselnitskaya offered him information on Clinton, but he claimed the information was not ""meaningful.""

""This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump,"" Goldstone said in his first email to Trump Jr. on June 3.

That email added that the Trump campaign could gain access to ""official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.""

In response, Trump Jr. wrote that ""if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer,"" and said he wanted to meet the following week.

The earliest email Trump shared on Twitter was dated June 6. In a 3:03 p.m. message from Trump to Goldstone, Trump asked if the two could speak immediately. A message from Goldstone to Trump preceded this email, but cannot be viewed.

Goldstone responded that hour that he would ""track him down in Moscow,"" though it's not clear who Goldstone is referring to. Trump tells Goldstone to have his friend call his cell phone.

""Ok he's on stage in Moscow but should be off within 20 Minutes so I am sure can call Rob,"" Goldstone responded.

During the 4 o'clock hour, Trump thanked him for the help. Goldstone wrote back the following afternoon.

""Hope all is well Emin asked that I schedule a meeting with you and the Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday. I believe you are aware of the meeting - and so wondered if 3pm or later on Thursday works for you? I assume it would be at your office,"" Goldstone wrote.

Trump thanked for setting up the meeting. Goldstone said he did not plan to sit in on the discussion, but would bring his friend by at 3 p.m.

""I will send the names of the two people meeting with you for security when I have them later today,"" Goldstone added.

Trump said he expected then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his brother-in-law Jared Kushner attending the meeting with him.

By Wednesday, June 8, Goldstone wrote Trump, asking to move the June 9 meeting from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. ""as the Russian attorney is in court until 3.""

Trump confirmed in a separate email with Manafort and Kushner the meeting will take place in his office at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Thursday.

The emails were released Tuesday morning shortly before the New York Times was expected to publish transcripts of Trump and Goldstone's interactions.

The three men believed Veselnistkaya had damaging information about Clinton, but said the meeting yielded nothing of interest to the campaign.

The New York Times reported Monday that Trump Jr. received an email stating that the Kremlin-tied lawyer had information damaging to Clinton, and that the information was part of Russia's attempts to help Trump during the campaign.

But Trump Jr. said the meeting ended when it became clear to the men that Veselnitskaya didn't have information, and instead wanted to discuss the adoption of Russian children by Americans.

The White House has maintained that Trump did not know about Trump Jr.'s meeting until it was reported in the press over the weekend.

But in a series of interviews Tuesday morning, Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to the president, said Trump Jr.'s attempts to gain damaging information against Clinton are ""what political campaigns do.""

Numerous congressional committees and special counsel Robert Mueller are currently investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russian officials to defeat Clinton.

Following the New York Times article last night, which stated Trump Jr., received an email from Goldstone saying the information against Clinton was part of the Russian government's attempts to aide Trump, a number of Senate and House Democrats have said the email indicates the Trump campaign sought Russia's help in defeating Clinton.

Earlier Tuesday, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said the investigation could now move beyond obstruction of justice and into ""perjury, false statements, and even into potentially treason."""

Investigators with the FBI as well as others part of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe are examining apartment purchases from Russians in Trump-owned buildings. They're also looking into the president's previous involvement in a SoHo hotel condominium development with Russian associates, the Miss Universe pageant, which took place in Moscow in 2013, and Trump's decision to sell a Florida mansion to a Russian oligarch in 2008, according to Bloomberg.

They're also examining dealings with the Bank of Cyprus, and Jared Kushner's attempts to secure financing for his family's real estate properties.

Wilbur Ross, Trump's commerce secretary, served as vice chairman of the Bank of Cyprus before joining the administration. Kushner is the president's son-in-law and a senior White House aide.

Mueller's investigation into Trump's business transactions stemmed from a money laundering probe started by former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, according to Bloomberg.

Trump asked Bharara, along with 46 other U.S. attorneys appointed by former President Barack Obama, to resign earlier this year. When he refused, Bharara said he was fired.

Bharara's investigation became part of Mueller's probe, which also includes lines of inquiry into Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election, contacts former national security adviser Mike Flynn had with Russia, and Russian hacking.

Mueller's team is looking into the 2013 Miss Universe pageant, which Trump owned, because Aras Agalarov, a Moscow developer, paid $20 million to host the event there. Roughly one-third of that amount went to Trump as part of a licensing fee, according to Forbes.

During the 2013 pageant, Trump met Herman Gref, the head of Russia's largest bank, Sberbank PJSC.

Agalarov's son, Emin, helped orchestrate a meeting that took place at Trump Tower last year between Donald Trump Jr., Kushner, and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and a Russian lawyer.

The lawyer was said to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

During an interview with the New York Times on Wednesday, Trump warned against Mueller and his investigators looking into matters too far from Russia.

""I think that's a violation. Look, this is about Russia. So I think if he wants to go, my finances are extremely good, my company is an unbelievably successful company,"" Trump said."

Akhmetshin is a Russian-American lobbyist believed to have ongoing ties to Russian intelligence operations. He was named as a lobbyist for an organization trying to rescind the 2012 Magnitsky Act.

Akhmetshin was also named in a complaint against the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation and others, filed by Hermitage Capital Management with the Justice Department last year.

Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin met with Donald Trump Jr., former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and Trump son-in-law and now-White House senior adviser Jared Kushner on June 9.

A publicist connected to the Trump business through the Miss Universe pageant, Rob Goldstone, set up the meeting between Veselnitskaya and Donald Trump Jr., with the promise that the meeting would hold negative information about Hillary Clinton coming from the Russian government.

Veselnitskaya, who has been linked to the Kremlin, waited until Friday before admitting to NBC News someone else accompanied her to Trump Tower, where she pivoted from the promise of dishing dirt on Hillary Clinton to lobbying the Trump campaign on adoption policy as it relates to Russia.

None of the Trump campaign or administration officials had disclosed the fifth person's attendance at the meeting and have not confirmed the new report.

Former President Barack Obama's Justice Department allowed Veselnitskaya to enter the U.S. without a visa, enabling her to lobby President Trump's campaign officials and others in Washington last year.

The Justice Department cleared Veselnitskaya under ""extraordinary circumstances,"" though her reason for traveling is now being scrutinized.

Veselnitskaya was allowed into the U.S. through a legal loophole, allowing her to accompany a colleague who was testifying in a House committee hearing about Russian policy.

Donald Trump Jr. earlier this week said he had now disclosed everything to do with the June 2016 meeting. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Friday struggled to explain why new information, including elements of the meeting, continue to trickle out from the media.

The FBI and two congressional committees are investigating the Trump campaign for possible collusion with the Russian government to win the 2016 presidential election."
377,##########,http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2628815,Weekend wrap: Healthcare bill waits for John McCain and Trump returns to ramped up Russia scandal,['Carolyn Kaster'],Washington Examiner,"President Trump returned from France to find the scandal over a meeting between his eldest son and two top campaign advisers and several Russians during the campaign had yet to subside and the Senate healthcare vote had to be delayed yet again.

Trump returned from France after Bastille Day celebrations on Friday and tried to change the news cycle with a series of tweets hailing progress in the stock market and the economy during his time in office.

However, he didn't stick to that message long before he was tweeting on Sunday about Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya and claiming the media was ""distorting democracy"" by making up information about the controversy.

The scandal was the focus of much of the Sunday shows as Trump's outside attorney Jay Sekulow did the ""full Ginsburg"" by appearing on all five major Sunday news shows.

Sekulow said the meeting couldn't have been too nefarious, otherwise the Secret Service would have not let Veselnitskaya and her associates into the meeting. T he Secret Service said later it didn't vet any of the meeting attendees because Trump Jr. was not under Secret Service protection at the time of the meeting.

Sekulow used the interviews to argue Trump Jr. and the Trump campaign did nothing illegal when he appeared to be willing to accept the Russian government's help to harm Hillary Clinton with damaging information.

However, news came out that Trump's campaign paid for Trump Jr.'s legal expenses weeks before news of the meeting was to break, an indication that the Trump camp knew bad news was coming.

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said Trump's refusal to accept that the Russians meddled in the election and tried to interfere on his behalf is proof that there's a lack of a ""whole of government approach"" to preventing future meddling.

He also said it appeared Trump Jr. reacted with ""glee"" when he was offered information from the Russian government that would harm Clinton.

Warner added he doesn't know why anyone would believe anything the Trump administration says about Russia and the 2016 election at this point given the different stories being told.

Rep. Adam Schiff said the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya showed there's clear evidence that the Trump campaign intended to collude with the Russian government to win the election.

Trump appeared at the U.S. Women's Open at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club, where some protesters showed up on Sunday to announce their unhappiness with his administration.

On the healthcare front, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the Better Care Reconciliation Act would be delayed at least one more week because Sen. John McCain had to have surgery to remove a blood clot above his left eye on Saturday. The procedure, which appears to have gone well, will keep McCain out of Washington for at least a week.

The fact that McCain is out and the vote will be delayed means the Congressional Budget Office will not release its analysis of the BCRA on Monday, as it was originally planning to do.

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn promised Democrats and Republicans will have an opportunity to amend the healthcare bill because it will be an ""open process"" when it comes up for debate.

Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins said the Senate bill ill would ""affect the most vulnerable"" because of its decreased Medicaid funding over the next 10 years. She remains against the bill.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is also a no on the BCRA right now and warned Trump against overselling how good the bill is and what it would do to fix the healthcare system. Paul said it hasn't answered the fundamental question of the time, which is how to get more young and healthy people to sign up for Obamacare in order to subsidize the sicker and older people on the exchanges.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services hit back at the negative reports about the Senate GOP healthcare bill that deem the decreased Medicaid funding in the bill a ""cut."" Instead, it sought to argue that it just slows the growth of Medicaid spending and doesn't actually cut any funding.

Trump also used Twitter to lash out at a Washington Post-ABC poll that showed he has a record-low approval rating for a president who's been on the job for six months. The poll showed Trump's approval rating is just 36 percent.

A report from The Sun newspaper indicated that low approval in the United Kingdom is delaying Trump's trip to Great Britain and the president told Prime Minister Theresa May he wouldn't visit until he gets better press coverage .

White House counselor Kellyanne Conway believes much of the criticism she receives is based on the fact that she's a woman instead of her advocacy for Trump and his policies.

The White House released a plan to reporters Sunday outlining a plan for three themed weeks coming up in July, starting off with ""Make America"" week this week. The White House plans to celebrate goods made in America and local stores.

This week will also mark the first meeting of the controversial voter fraud commission that is looking into Trump's claims that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally in the 2016 election, costing him the popular vote.

White House adviser Sebastian Gorka said he's aggressive in TV interviews because ""somebody has to be the pit bull"" for Trump on cable TV. Gorka has made waves for his confrontational style in cable TV interviews.

Vice President Mike Pence received some criticism from a spokesman for Ohio Gov. John Kasich over his comments that 60,000 Ohioans are on wait lists for care due to the Affordable Care Act. The governor's office called that ""Fake News"" and said there's no evidence to back the vice president's claim.

Rep. Ted Lieu, one of the most outspoken critics of Trump, thanked Fox News' Shep Smith for ""telling the truth"" about the Trump family's deception over the Russian email scandal.

Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis said the House Intelligence Committee is bringing in ""big names"" to investigate leaks from the intelligence community to the press and believes former staffer to President Obama Ben Rhodes is behind many of the leaks to the press from the National Security Council.

Rep. Al Green, one of two Democratic congressmen to sign on to articles of impeachment filed against Trump, said there's going to be more coming against the president.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly criticized Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin's ceasefire in southern Syria by saying the deal would only allow the Iranians to grow in power.

Wikileaks found Julian Assange offered his support to a lawsuit of free speech advocates who are suing Trump over his decision to block people on Twitter.

Billionaire Richard Branson, a climate activist, called Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement a very strange decision.

Another billionaire, Elon Musk, called artificial intelligence a ""fundamental risk"" to human existence in an interview.

On the same day, a drone delivered a gavel to Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval to start the meeting of the National Governors Association.

Former FBI Director James Comey is signed up to write a book, which will presumably deal with his controversial dealings with Trump during the first few months of the administration.

The head of Customs and Border Patrol said he's looking forward to seeing what his agency can do with an expanded ""tool kit"" under Trump's administration.

Caitlyn Jenner is considering whether to run for Senate and wants to figure out how she can have the most impact on the political world — inside the government or outside of it.

Jane Sanders, wife of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, claimed the investigation into her dealings as president of Burlington College is ""sexist"" because the complainant is a Trump supporter who wants to bring down her husband's political career."

Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, and Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign chairman, met with Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer, at Trump Tower last year.

It was initially believed the only people in the meeting were Trump Jr., Manafort, Kushner, and Veselnitskaya. But on Friday, it was revealed a Russian-American lobbyist, Rinat Akhmetshin, and translator, Anatoli Samochornov, were also there.

""They wanted the original agenda. They wanted the dirt,"" CNN host Alisyn Camerota said of Trump Jr.'s meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya in June 2016.

""Which is what political campaigns do,"" Gorka responded.

Gorka and Camerota were discussing reports that the president's son, Trump Jr., met with a Kremlin-connected lawyer, Veselnitskaya, who said she had information that would be damaging to Clinton.

The meeting took place at Trump Tower last year, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, also attended.

Trump Jr. acknowledged he set up the meeting in hopes Veselnitskaya ""might have information helpful to the campaign,"" but said the Russian lawyer's statements were ""vague, ambiguous and made no sense.""

The conversation between the Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya then turned to the issue of American adoptions of Russian children.

During his interview with CNN, Gorka argued Veselnitskaya isn't connected to the Kremlin, and said the meeting ended after Trump Jr., Kushner, and Manafort realized she had requested the meeting under false pretenses.

""She was a private lawyer who had an interest with regards to the Russian adoption program and used a pretext to get a meeting with the campaign, which the campaign representatives almost immediately realized was not done in good faith, that she had another agenda, and that's when the meeting ended,"" Gorka said.

The White House has maintained Trump Jr.'s meeting with Veselnitskaya was short and in the course of normal campaign activities, but the New York Times reported late Monday night Trump Jr. was told in an email the damaging information Veselnitskaya had about Clinton was part of a Russian effort to help Trump's candidacy.

The report from the New York Times has raised eyebrows among House and Senate Democrats, who believe the existence of an email could indicate Trump Jr. and the Trump campaign sought Russia's help in defeating Clinton.

Several congressional committees and the FBI are investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. So far, though, no evidence has suggested that there was collusion between the two."
380,##########,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/five-big-issues-raised-by-donald-trump-jrs-emails/article/2628287,Five big issues raised by Donald Trump Jr.'s emails,['David Goldman'],Washington Examiner,"A chain of emails published Tuesday by Donald Trump Jr., President Trump's eldest son, raised fresh questions about the Trump campaign's contact with Russians during the presidential race and placed the White House's previous denials of such contact under renewed scrutiny.

The emails suggested Trump Jr. pursued what he thought was opposition research about Hillary Clinton from a source connected to the Russian government last year, contradicting his previous claim that the meeting was always intended to focus primarily on adoption.

Here are five issues raised by the email chain.

More evidence of Russians' efforts to boost Trump

Rob Goldstone, the publicist who arranged the June 2016 meeting, told Trump Jr. that the supposedly ""sensitive"" information a Russian lawyer had prepared for him was ""part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.""

White House officials have avoided embracing the conclusion reached by several intelligence agencies that Russian actors specifically aimed to help Trump's campaign while harming Clinton's.

The direct admission from someone close to the president's son that Russia wanted to help Trump's chances will likely complicate the administration's efforts to deny or downplay the significance of Russian involvement.

Confirmation of Russian contacts

In the seven months since Trump took office, the president, his aides and many of his Republican supporters have repeatedly stressed the lack of evidence that high-level campaign officials ever had any contact with Russian officials during the presidential race.

The Trump Jr. emails shatter that claim, making clear that the highest-ranking campaign officials knew of and willingly engaged in at least one contact with a lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, who was described in the thread as connected directly to the Russian government.

Implication of a current White House official

Neither Paul Manafort — Trump's former campaign manager, who attended the meeting and had access to the emails — nor Trump Jr. are presently involved with the White House in any way.

Trump tasked Trump Jr. with running his real estate empire and maintains a professional separation from his eldest son to avoid conflicts of interest.

However, Jared Kushner — the president's son-in-law, who also attended the meeting — is presently a senior adviser to the president and oversees a broad policy portfolio in that role.

Kushner was forwarded the email chain Trump Jr. posted on Tuesday, indicating that he was likely aware of the nature of the meeting and the claim from Goldstone that Russians aimed to help his father-in-law win the election.

The involvement of someone currently employed in the West Wing will prevent White House officials from distancing themselves from the revelations contained in the emails. Previously, the White House has attempted to downplay similarly damaging revelations by noting that they've concerned former campaign officials, including Manafort, who are no longer associated with the administration.

Contradiction of Donald Trump Jr.'s denials

Trump Jr. has denied meeting with anyone connected to the Russian government since March, when the New York Times asked him directly.

""Did I meet with people that were Russian? I'm sure, I'm sure I did,"" Trump Jr. told the Times earlier this year. ""But none that were set up. None that I can think of at the moment. And certainly none that I was representing the campaign in any way.""

Trump Jr. had, since the story first began to trickle out over the weekend, attempted to downplay the meeting as a routine research-gathering effort that ultimately produced a discussion about Russian adoptions.

But the emails make clear that Trump Jr. believed he would receive aid from the Russian government that could help his father attack Clinton on the campaign trail.

And the messages indicate the meeting was indeed ""set up"" and related directly to his role as a campaign surrogate, contradicting his prior denial.

Alienation of Republican allies

The latest — and potentially most explosive — revelation in the months-long Russia controversy is likely to chill relations between the White House and its GOP allies on Capitol Hill.

Some Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, quickly expressed frustration with Trump Jr.'s misleading explanations of the meeting and called on the president's son to testify before Congress.

Few Republican lawmakers have been willing to defend Trump unconditionally, and previous rocky moments — such as the sudden removal of former FBI Director James Comey — have sent most GOP members running for the hills.

The timing of the Trump Jr. emails could complicate Republican efforts to focus attention on their healthcare legislation and away from the turbulent White House."

The committee had invited him to testify in public in July, but Trump Jr. was able to negotiate the closed-door interview, confirmed by a spokesman for the committee and first reported by CNN. However, the spokesman would not confirm the exact date the interview will take place.

The committee's chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and ranking member, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., put out a statement later in the day, and they too did not confirm a date.

""In late July, Donald Trump Jr. agreed to provide the Judiciary Committee with documents and a transcribed interview prior to a public hearing. Shortly thereafter, a date for that interview was set and agreed to by both the Committee and Trump Jr,"" the senators wrote. ""This meeting will be conducted under the same terms as previously announced.""

In July, Trump Jr. tweeted the emails that detailed the meeting with a Russian lawyer and others in response to an imminent report from the New York Times, which was set to publish the email chain after it had already reported on the existence of the communications.

The evidence was one of the first hard connections between the Trump campaign and any Russian official, other than some occasional contacts with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, which those related to the Trump campaign have continued to maintain were incidental meetings.

Whether Trump Jr. will have to testify in any public setting is still yet to be seen.

Just after releasing the email chain, Trump Jr. went on Fox News with Sean Hannity and downplayed the importance of the emails, and told the host, ""I think it's a little bit ridiculous and overplayed.""

The meeting in Trump Tower with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was also attended by President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort.

Veselnitsaya has indicated she is willing to testify to a senate panel about the meeting as well."

The New York Times said that Trump signed off on the statement, in which Trump Jr. said the meeting had been primarily related to a ban on adoptions by American families of Russian children.

The original statement was drafted aboard Air Force One by advisers and then approved by Trump himself.

Follow-up statements offered more details, and after the Times reported over the weekend that Trump Jr. accepted the June 9, 2016, meeting with the Kremlin-connected lawyer after being promised information damaging to Hillary Clinton, his father's Democratic opponent, Trump Jr. changed his explanation.

He admitted the attorney, Natalia Veselnitskaya, offered him information on Clinton, but he said the information was not ""meaningful.""

On Tuesday, after the Times obtained an email chain in which Trump Jr. pronounced ""I love it"" when presented with a chance to meet with Veselnitskaya, he published the emails in full on Twitter.

Trump Jr. told Fox News' Sean Hannity on Tuesday that in retrospect, ""he probably would have done things a little differently."" He also said he did not discuss the meeting with his father, at least not until news about it broke this weekend. ""It was just a nothing. There was nothing to tell. I mean, I wouldn't have even remembered it until you started scouring through this stuff. It was literally just a wasted 20 minutes, which was a shame,"" Trump Jr. said.

The Times reported Tuesday that the president is more frustrated with the negative media attention than he is with Trump Jr. The president has reportedly expressed his frustration to his team of personal lawyers, headed by Marc Kasowitz, which could lay the groundwork for Kasowitz's exit."

""This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump,"" Goldstone said in his first email to Trump Jr. on June 3.

That email added that the Trump campaign could gain access to ""official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.""

In response, Trump Jr. wrote that ""if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer,"" and said he wanted to meet the following week.

The earliest email Trump shared on Twitter was dated June 6. In a 3:03 p.m. message from Trump to Goldstone, Trump asked if the two could speak immediately. A message from Goldstone to Trump preceded this email, but cannot be viewed.

Goldstone responded that hour that he would ""track him down in Moscow,"" though it's not clear who Goldstone is referring to. Trump tells Goldstone to have his friend call his cell phone.

""Ok he's on stage in Moscow but should be off within 20 Minutes so I am sure can call Rob,"" Goldstone responded.

During the 4 o'clock hour, Trump thanked him for the help. Goldstone wrote back the following afternoon.

""Hope all is well Emin asked that I schedule a meeting with you and the Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday. I believe you are aware of the meeting - and so wondered if 3pm or later on Thursday works for you? I assume it would be at your office,"" Goldstone wrote.

Trump thanked for setting up the meeting. Goldstone said he did not plan to sit in on the discussion, but would bring his friend by at 3 p.m.

""I will send the names of the two people meeting with you for security when I have them later today,"" Goldstone added.

Trump said he expected then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his brother-in-law Jared Kushner attending the meeting with him.

By Wednesday, June 8, Goldstone wrote Trump, asking to move the June 9 meeting from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. ""as the Russian attorney is in court until 3.""

Trump confirmed in a separate email with Manafort and Kushner the meeting will take place in his office at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Thursday.

The emails were released Tuesday morning shortly before the New York Times was expected to publish transcripts of Trump and Goldstone's interactions.

The three men believed Veselnistkaya had damaging information about Clinton, but said the meeting yielded nothing of interest to the campaign.

The New York Times reported Monday that Trump Jr. received an email stating that the Kremlin-tied lawyer had information damaging to Clinton, and that the information was part of Russia's attempts to help Trump during the campaign.

But Trump Jr. said the meeting ended when it became clear to the men that Veselnitskaya didn't have information, and instead wanted to discuss the adoption of Russian children by Americans.

The White House has maintained that Trump did not know about Trump Jr.'s meeting until it was reported in the press over the weekend.

But in a series of interviews Tuesday morning, Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to the president, said Trump Jr.'s attempts to gain damaging information against Clinton are ""what political campaigns do.""

Numerous congressional committees and special counsel Robert Mueller are currently investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russian officials to defeat Clinton.

Following the New York Times article last night, which stated Trump Jr., received an email from Goldstone saying the information against Clinton was part of the Russian government's attempts to aide Trump, a number of Senate and House Democrats have said the email indicates the Trump campaign sought Russia's help in defeating Clinton.

Earlier Tuesday, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said the investigation could now move beyond obstruction of justice and into ""perjury, false statements, and even into potentially treason."""

During a conference call with reporters, Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, told reporters the Kremlin didn't know the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, who met with Trump Jr. last year.

Veselnitskaya represents business executives with ties to the Russian government.

Peskov said the Kremlin ""cannot track all the Russian lawyers in the country and abroad,"" according to Tass, Russia's state-owned news service.

The New York Times reported Sunday that Trump organized a meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016 with Veselnitskaya, who promised she had information about Clinton. Included in the meeting were Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

Both Kushner and Manafort reported the meeting on revised forms that are required to obtain a security clearance.

""After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Mrs. Clinton,"" Trump Jr. said in a statement to the New York Times. ""Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.""

Trump Jr. denied that the meeting was inappropriate and said Veselnitskaya then turned the conversation to the subject of adoption of Russian children and the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law that bans suspected Russian human rights abusers from the U.S.

Putin and other Russian officials despise the law, and its passage prompted Putin to stop American adoptions of Russian children.

It's unclear what the status of Mueller's investigation is, but Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, Clinton's former running mate, said the emails from Trump Jr. should provide Mueller and the Senate Intelligence Committee with ""wheelbarrows"" of new evidence.

""These emails show there is no longer a question of whether this campaign sought to collude with a hostile foreign power to subvert America's democracy.

While the news has again shaken up the Trump administration, the president tweeted just hours before the broadcast that Trump Jr. is a ""great person who loves our country!""

My son, Donald, will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10:00 P.M. He is a great person who loves our country! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2017

Trump Jr. accepted a meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian attorney, after an intermediary suggested Veselnitskaya had ""sensitive"" information about Clinton gathered through the Kremlin's efforts to boost then-candidate Donald Trump.

The president's eldest son published four pages of emails on Tuesday that shed light on how he, Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner ended up in a meeting at Trump Tower last summer with a Russian lawyer. Neither Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, nor Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, have spoken out about the meeting, which Trump Jr. said ultimately focused on adoptions.

""In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently,"" Trump Jr. said Tuesday in his interview with Hannity, which will air in full at 10 p.m. ET. ""Again, this is before the Russia mania, this is before they were building this up in the press. For me this was opposition research, they had something, you know, maybe concrete evidence to all the stories I'd been hearing about, probably under-reported for years not just during the campaign so I think I wanted to hear it out. But really it went nowhere and it was apparent that wasn't what the meeting was about.""

""This revelation should be the end of the idea pushed by the administration and the president that there is absolutely no evidence of an intent by the Trump campaign to coordinate or collude,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor. He was referring to the New York Times' Sunday report that said the lawyer told Trump Jr. she had damaging information about Clinton, after Trump Jr. initially said the meeting was about Russian adoption.

""It is certainly not proof positive. We don't know what was said in the meeting. But these reports in the press at least demand further investigation,"" Schumer said.

Along with Trump Jr., the June 2016 meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya included Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, then Trump's campaign chairman. It came soon after Trump became the de facto Republican nominee.

""It defies credulity that the president's campaign manager, his son, his son-in-law at the height of a very, very heated campaign... were all going to a meeting with the Russia lawyer to discuss Russian adoption,"" Schumer said.

Trump Jr., President Trump's eldest son, and Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, are under scrutiny after it was revealed earlier this month that they engaged in a meeting in June 2016 with a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

The hearing is entitled, ""Oversight of the Justice Department's (Non) Enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act: Lessons from the Obama Administration‎ and Current Compliance Practices.""

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Judiciary Committee chairman, and ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., say they will issue subpoenas if Trump Jr. and Manafort do not voluntarily agree to testify.

The original hearing was scheduled for Wednesday, June 19, but was postponed less than 24 hours prior.

Taylor Foy, a spokesman for Grassley, told the Washington Examiner the hearing was postponed as he and Feinstein ""work together to schedule additional witnesses and seek relevant documents.""

Still on the witness list is William Browder of Hermitage Capital Management. Browder's late lawyer Sergie Magnitsky has loose ties to Natala Veselnitskaya, the Russian attorney who led the now-infamous June 2016 meeting.

Trump Jr. met with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in 2016, and nearly a year later, the Justice Department settled with Prevezon Holdings, the company she represented.

The Democratic letter didn't explain how the two events might be connected, but said they are worried ""the two events may be connected — and that the department may have settled the case at a loss for the United States in order to obscure the underlying facts.""

The case brought against the Russian firm Prevezon Holdings was scheduled to go to trial in late May of 2017, but was settled just days prior. The $6 million settlement was roughly half of the amount originally sought by the Justice Department in the case, which had been brought against Prevezon in 2013 by former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara.

The Democrats also note in their letter to Sessions that Prevezon never had to admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement.

The Obama administration's Justice Department accused the company of laundering ""some proceeds of a $230 million Russian tax refund fraud scheme involving corrupt Russian officials.""

Veselnitskaya, the lawyer who met with Trump Jr. last June in Trump Tower, worked on the case defending Prevezon in the Southern District of New York in 2016. Trump Jr. released emails this week showing that he was told Veselnitskaya had damaging information on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

Democrats said they want to know why the case was settled days before the trial was scheduled to begin, and asked for ""prosecution files"" and any other materials that could explain the decision.

They also want to know if President Trump, White House staff, the Trump family or anyone with the Trump presidential campaign contacted the Justice Department regarding the Prevezon case.

And finally, the Democrats want to know if Sessions discussed the Prevezon case with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, someone Sessions has said he met with two, possible three times prior to becoming attorney general.

The survey from the Monmouth University Polling Institute found that 41 percent of Americans support impeaching Trump six months into his first term. Fifty-three percent are opposed to the president's impeachment.

A July 1973 poll from Gallup taken during Nixon's second term found that 24 percent of Americans supported Nixon's impeachment, and 62 percent were opposed.

""Even though Trump's approval rating is similar to Nixon's, more Americans support impeachment today than did in 1973,"" Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement. ""That's partly due to the current hyper-partisanship that was simply not prevalent 40 years ago.""

Two Democrats in Congress, Reps. Brad Sherman of California and Al Green of Texas, filed an article of impeachment against Trump last week.

The two lawmakers accused the president of obstructing justice by asking former FBI Director James Comey to curtail his investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and subsequently firing Comey.

Sherman and Green filed the article of impeachment after it was revealed that members of the Trump family and the campaign met with Russians in Trump Tower last year.

Donald Trump Jr., former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner met with a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, in June 2016 after Trump Jr. was promised damaging information on Hillary Clinton.

Despite the recent revelations, the president's approval rating has remained steady, Monmouth's poll found.

Thirty-nine percent approve of the job Trump is doing in office — his approval rating was the same in May — and 52 percent disapprove.

But in a press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump was asked about the latest Russia-collusion story — Specifically, whether his son was wrong to have met with a Kremlin associate at Trump Tower last summer. Trump was unapologetic.

""Most people would have taken that meeting"", Trump claimed. He continued, ""He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer. Not a government lawyer, but a Russian lawyer.""

For connected reasons, both these claims are disingenuous.

First off, the lawyer in question, Natalia Veselnitskaya, is not just a ""Russian lawyer."" She is a lawyer who has a long-standing relationship with the Kremlin elite. And by Kremlin elite, I mean Russian President Vladimir Putin's crew. Specifically, Veselnitskaya has made her name representing corrupt Russian oligarchs against international criminal proceedings. But what really matters here is the reality of what it means to be a Russian connected to powerful foreign officials like team Trump.

Because it means that you are either directly or indirectly under the supervision of the Russian intelligence services (aka Putin).

Putin revels in using intermediaries or ""cut-outs"" to engage with foreign individuals. Sometimes the cut-outs are sent to kill an individual, sometimes to drink tea and play nice, sometimes to do both. Yet it should have been obvious to team Trump that a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer offering negative information on Hillary Clinton was not acting in a private capacity.

It's not just that the Russians control this kind of activity. It's that Russians who do act on sensitive matters without government direction are predisposed to early deaths. Whether openly or not, Veselnitskaya was obviously acting on behalf of the Russian government.

Moreover, a basic rule of espionage — and we must consider Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner (who met Veselnitskaya with Donald Trump Jr.) in this category — is the pursuit of opportunity. The Russian intelligence services have an especially aggressive tendency to cast lines in every direction and wait for someone to bite. To be sure, they know that most people will sense Russia's hand at play and stay away. But they also know that others will either be too stupid, or too greedy or too compromised not to bite. Again, the enduring rule of MICE means some people will always bite.

Regardless, the simple point here is that team Trump should never have agreed to this meeting. They knew they were dealing with the Russians, they knew that the meeting affected national security, and they should have known that once you're in bed with the Russians you never out.

That they still went ahead with this meeting proves why the collusion investigations are necessary. Trump's assessment is patently wrong."

""It remains unclear what security protocols the Secret Service may have had in place at Trump Tower while the protectee was present.""

During an interview with ABC News on Sunday, Jay Sekulow, a member of President Trump's outside legal team, questioned why Secret Service allowed Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin into Trump Tower to meet with Donald Trump Jr., then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner.

The three men met with Veselnitskaya, after Trump Jr. was told she had damaging information on Hillary Clinton. A translator was also in attendance.

""Well, I wonder why the Secret Service, if this was nefarious, why the Secret Service allowed these people in,"" Sekulow said. ""The president had Secret Service protection at that point, and that raised a question with me.""

The Secret Service responded to Sekulow's statements Sunday and said it would not have screened or vetted anyone Trump Jr. was meeting with in June 2016 because the president's son wasn't under Secret Service protection.

Cummings now wants information from the agency about how it vetted people at Trump Tower, including an explanation of what screening or vetting occurred for those attending meetings on June 9, 2016, the date of Trump Jr.'s meeting with Veselnitskaya.

But congressional Democrats have begun to take issue with Trump's security clearance form SF-86 after it was revealed that Kushner attended a meeting arranged by Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower last year with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.

Kushner, a senior adviser to President Trump, updated his federal disclosure form recently to include his contact with Veselnitskaya and has done so three times total, adding more than 100 names to it.

""Jared Kushner's updates to his security clearance form related to this Russia meeting raise new questions about his wife, Ivanka Trump,"" Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., said in a series of tweets.

The security clearance application asks if ""you or any member of your immediate family in the past seven years had any contact with a foreign government, its establishment (such as an embassy, consulate, agency, military service, intelligence or security service, etc.) or its representatives, whether inside or outside the U.S.?""

""Immediate family"" includes a spouse, parents, step-parents, siblings, half and step-siblings, children, step-children, and cohabitants.

Beyer said he had to discuss potential foreign contacts with his wife when he was tapped as ambassador to Switzerland by then President Barack Obama in 2009, and thus had to complete the SF-86.

Now, the Virginia Democrat is questioning what Trump knew about her husband's meeting with Veselnitskaya, and whether she disclosed the meeting on her own security clearance application.

""Did Ivanka include that meeting on her SF-86 to obtain a security clearance, as part of her disclosure of her husband's contacts?"" Beyer asked on his Twitter account. ""If she did not declare it before, has Ivanka Trump's SF-86 been updated to include disclosure of this meeting which her husband attended? Has she updated her security clearance paperwork to reflect the other meetings and contacts Jared Kushner originally failed to disclose?""

""Ivanka Trump is an adviser to the President of the United States. We hold people in such a position to a very high standard. That standard requires that we get answers to these questions about Ivanka Trump. I tend to raise them with the Trump Administration,"" Beyer continued. ""If the President wants his family to run the government, they must be held to the same high standard as any other government official.""

Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, said President Trump's team is making things more difficult for itself because of the ""interconnection and closeness.""

""What the Trump team is doing is, from a legal point of view, they're intertwining themselves,"" Quigley told Politico. ""They're interconnecting and therefore implicating each other, at least in the investigation.""

In addition to meeting with Veselnitskaya, Kushner has had meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, which he failed to disclose.

His failure to include his contacts with Kislyak earned him swift criticism from Democrats earlier this year, and some, including Beyer, are calling for Kushner's security clearance to be revoked."

""This is about as clear evidence as you could find about intent by the campaign to collude with the Russians, to get useful information from the Russians,"" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told ABC News.

In emails between the president's eldest son and a British publicist, Rob Goldstone, who orchestrated the meeting, Trump Jr. told Goldstone ""I love it"" when told about the prospect about getting material that would be harmful to Clinton.

""If that's what you say I love it especially later in the summer,"" Trump Jr. wrote in a June 2016 email to Goldstone.

Goldstone also told Trump Jr. the information was part of the Russian government's efforts to aide Trump's candidacy.

Veselnitskaya failed to deliver material on Clinton, and Trump Jr. said conversation instead turned to repeal of a 2012 law, the Magnitsky Act, that sanctioned Russian human rights violators. Russian President Vladimir Putin stopped the adoption of Russian children by Americans as a response to the law.

Schiff, who is on the committee investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election, said that email from Trump Jr. indicates the president's son was willing to accept information from the Russian government.

""Willingness not only to accept but to indicate to Russia what the best timing was,"" Schiff said. ""Of course, Don Jr. said in the emails late summer, and what do we know about late summer? That's when the Russians start dumping this information.""

""To accept the attorney's representation that no crime was committed here, you have to accept Don Jr.'s representations,"" Schiff continued, referencing comments Sunday by Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow.

""If they went into the meeting and here they want something, they want information from the Russians, the Russians want something. They want repeal of the sanctions law, the Magnitsky Law. If any kind of understanding that comes out of that meeting, you get us the dirt, you start leaking dirt on Hillary Clinton, and we will look favorably on repealing the Magnitsky Act, that is a very serious crime."""

Grassley, R-Iowa, sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Monday asking for visa records and documentation for the lobbyist, Rinat Akhmetshin, as well as information on his travel activity.

In June 2016, Akhmetshin and a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, met with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort at Trump Tower.

Trump Jr. attended the meeting, which included British publicist Rob Goldstone, a translator, and a Russian businessman, because he was promised damaging information on Hillary Clinton. But the president's eldest son said the gathering failed to yield any information and instead focused mostly on repeal of the Magnitksy Act, a 2012 law that punished Russian human-rights abusers.

After details of the meeting were revealed last week, Grassley requested information from Tillerson and Kelly on visa and parole information for Veselnitskaya.

Grassley's inquiries into Akhmetshin and Veselnitskaya aren't new.

The Judiciary Committee is currently investigating allegations that Russian government agents, including Akhmetshin and Veselnitskaya, failed to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act while working on behalf of the Russian government to repeal the Magnitsky Act.

As part of that probe, Grassley asked Kelly for immigration information and received Akhmetshin's alien file."

""I'm not sure why we take anybody in the senior level of the Trump administration at their word,"" Warner told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday.

""There seems to be a convenient pattern where all of the senior officials of the Trump campaign forget about meetings with Russians, don't put it on their forms until evidence comes out and then they have to amend,"" he continued.

Trump's son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner has amended a federal disclosure form to obtain security clearance three times, adding more than 100 names.

Applicants for security clearances must list all their meetings with foreign contacts.

One of the updates included Kushner's meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Donald Trump Jr. and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort were also present at the meeting in Trump Tower.

""It's unbelievable that neither the son nor son-in-law ever shared that information with their dad, the candidate,"" Warner said.

Trump's son-in-law and now adviser Jared Kushner and former campaign manager Paul Manafort attended the meeting alongside Trump Jr. on June 9, 2016. News of the meeting comes as criminal and congressional probes are examining Russian interference with the 2016 election.

Multiple U.S. intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russia sought to interfere with the election in order to tip it in Trump's favor.

The attorney at the meeting was Natalia Veselnitskaya, according to the report from the New York Times, which sites knowledge of confidential government records. Veselnitskaya has fought a U.S. law called the Magnitsky Act that blacklists suspected human rights abusers and she has close ties to the Russian government, the Times said.

Donald Trump Jr. said in a statement to the Times that it was a short and introductory meeting.

""We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow-up,"" according to a statement provided to the Times.

Trump Jr. told the Times back in March that he didn't participate in any campaign-related meetings with Russian nationals.

Kushner's lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, told the Times that he submitted information during the campaign and transition on calls and meetings from representatives of more than 20 countries.

Manafort was President Trump's campaign manager but was forced to resign after revelations about his business ties with Russia.

Both Manafort and Kushner as being looked at as part of the special prosecutor's investigation into Russian interference in the 2017 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.

President Trump's outside legal team later sent out a statement suggesting that the meeting may have set up to create the appearance of impropriety.

""We have learned from both our own investigation and public reports that the participants in the meeting misrepresented who they were and who they worked for,"" wrote Mark Corallo, spokesperson for President Trump's outside counsel, in a statement. ""Specifically, we have learned that the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS, a firm which according to public reports, was retained by Democratic operatives to develop opposition research on the President and which commissioned the phony Steele dossier,"" he continued, referencing the discredited anti-Trump dossier from Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent.

""These developments raise serious issue as to exactly who authorized and participated in any effort by Russian nationals to influence our election in any manner,"" Corallo added."

""Very troubling. And obviously moves our whole investigation to another level.""

Trump Jr. tweeted an email exchange with British publicist Rob Goldstone earlier this week showing how the meeting with a Russian attorney was set up. In the email, Goldstone said the Russian government wanted to help Trump get elected and had some incriminating information on Clinton that could be passed along.

Trump Jr. said ""I love it"" about the offer and indicated it would be good to have such information released later on in the summer.

The meeting itself ended up being about the Magnitsky Act, which put sanctions on Russian human rights violators. In response to that law, Russian President Vladimir Putin banned Americans from adopting Russian children.

Warner said wants to hear from everyone who was in the meeting in June 2016 between the Trump campaign and Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, including Trump Jr. He said it's something the Senate Intelligence Committee, of which Warner is the ranking Democrat, should be moving forward on soon.

""Chairman [Richard] Burr and I are working together in a bipartisan fashion,"" he said.

Calls for Trump Jr., Kushner, and Manafort to testify come after the New York Times reported this weekend the three men attended a meeting at Trump Tower last year with a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, with the promise of receiving damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

The meeting was orchestrated by Rob Goldstone, a British publicist, and Trump Jr. posted to his Twitter account Tuesday a series of email exchanges he had with Goldstone about the meeting.

""This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump,"" Goldstone continued.

After the New York Times' initial article Monday detailing the existence of Trump Jr.'s email exchange, a number of House and Senate Democrats began calling for the president's son to testify before Congress.

Trump Jr. said he would be willing to answer lawmakers' questions.

Others, such as Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Trump Jr. made an ""attempt at collusion"" by meeting with Veselnitskaya.

Pelosi criticized Trump and his administration for its ""shady Russian connections"" and said the White House is ""desperate to hide the truth.""

""There's no escaping it: the Trump campaign's inner circle met with an agent of a hostile foreign power to influence the outcome of an American election. The American people face a White House riddled with shadowy Russian connections and desperate to hide the truth,"" she said.

Veselnitskaya has said she was not working for the Russian government at the time of the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower.

But after he released an email chain on Twitter this week about his 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer, the Campaign Legal Center and Democracy 21 were able to file a more advanced complaint.

Their complaint includes Jared Kusher and Paul Manafort, who also took part in the June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

""The evidence is clear that Don Jr. knew that the offer of opposition campaign research came from the Russian government, and the law is clear that giving such valuable research for free would have been a contribution to the Trump campaign,"" said Brendan Fischer, a director at the Campaign Legal Center. ""By soliciting that contribution and arranging and attending a meeting to receive it, Don Jr. clearly violated the prohibition against soliciting a contribution from a foreign national.""

The groups say the emails released by Trump Jr. show a violation of federal campaign finance law.

Trump Jr. received an email from Rob Goldstone offering ""official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary"" collected by the Russian government, to which responded that he ""appreciate[d]"" the offer and that he ""love[d] it.""

Trump Jr. then requested a call to obtain the alleged information, which he described as ""political opposition research."" This request by Trump Jr. for a call with Agalarov to get the alleged information on Clinton is a solicitation of a contribution under federal campaign finance law, the watchdog complaints allege.

No information was divulged in the 2016 meeting, however, and President Trump has maintained he only just learned of the meeting. The administration is defending the meeting as something that anyone would take for ""opposition research.""

Until completion of the review, the three senators said, Kushner's security clearance should be suspended.

""Mr. Kushner attended a meeting which was held with the stated purpose to receive Russian government information intended to influence a U.S. election,"" the senators wrote.

Kushner was in attendance at the meeting, which took place in June 2016, along with Trump Jr., former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, and the Russian attorney, Natalia Veselnitskaya.

Stone has dubbed Kushner a leaker in the past. In April he alleged. Kushner was leaking information to hurt White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.

Stone, who has admitted to being in contact with Guccifer 2.0, a Russia-linked hacker, will testify later this month before the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting a probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.

Trump Jr. has admitted Veselnitskaya offered him information on Clinton, but he claimed the information was not ""meaningful."" Still, critics have said this meeting is evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, which members of the U.S. intelligence community say meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump's chances."

Kushner, President Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law, participated in the meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya who promised to provide incriminating information about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president. Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, also attended the meeting.

Politico said Kushner is worried the revelations of the meeting will harm Trump's presidency.

White House communications aides, including press secretary Sean Spicer, have reportedly advocated for outside counsel to handle the defense of Trump Jr. and Kushner.

But Kushner is calling for the White House to play a more active role, and he was angry that there were no talking points offered to surrogates already making the rounds.

The White House disputed that Kushner is complaining to communications officials about the defense of the meeting with the Russian attorney.

""These conversations simply did not happen and Jared did not raise a single one of these points besides saying thank you to everyone for their continued hard work,"" the White House said in a statement attributed to Spicer, and other communications officials.

""I think that is utterly and completely ridiculous,"" Sanders said at the press briefing Wednesday, ""and a political game at its worst.""

Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., introduced an article of impeachment earlier Wednesday accusing Trump of obstruction of justice.

""Donald John Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the case of law and justice and to the manifest injury of people of the United States,"" Sherman's bill reads.

The California Democrat was joined by Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, in introducing the article of impeachment.

The two Democratic lawmakers argue the president obstructed justice when he asked former FBI Director James Comey to curtail the bureau's investigation into Mike Flynn, his former national security adviser, and subsequently fired Comey in May in what they said was an attempt to slow the investigation into ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia.

Sherman said in early June that Trump should be impeached, but he renewed his call for impeachment after emails from Donald Trump Jr. were published Tuesday.

The president's eldest son posted an email exchange to his Twitter account — before the New York Times published the contents of the exchange — in which Trump Jr. said he was interested in receiving damaging information about Hillary Clinton from a ""Russian government lawyer.""

The meeting was orchestrated by an intermediary, Rob Goldstone, who told Trump Jr. the information was part of the Russian government's efforts to help his father in the campaign.

""Recent disclosures by Donald Trump Jr. indicate that Trump's campaign was eager to receive assistance from Russia,"" Sherman said in a statement.

Ken Vogel, a reporter for the New York Times, told MSNBC on Friday the sixth person is Anatoli Samochornov, a translator who worked with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya for several years.

Samochornov worked with Veselnitskaya during her efforts to overturn the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law that sanctioned Russian human rights violators and angered Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Vogel said the translator also worked for the State Department as a contractor assisting with translation and interpretation services.

The meeting at Trump Tower last year has caused concern among Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill and cast a shadow on the White House this week. Trump Jr. said he accepted the meeting with Veselnitskaya, orchestrated through British publicist Rob Goldstone, because he was promised damaging information on Hillary Clinton.

In emails revealed by Trump Jr. earlier this week, Goldstone said the information was part of the Russian government's efforts to assist Trump's campaign.

It was initially believed that Trump Jr., Veselnitskaya, then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, were the only ones who attended the meeting.

But the Associated Press and NBC News reported Friday a fifth person, identified as a Russian-American lobbyist named Rinat Akhmetshin, was also there.

One such update included contact Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and a White House senior adviser, had with a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya.

Kushner, Donald Trump Jr., and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort met with Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in June 2016 after they were promised damaging information on Hillary Clinton.

After the New York Times published details of the meeting earlier this week, Democratic lawmakers began raising questions about Kushner's security clearance.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters Thursday his security clearance should be revoked immediately, and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., introduced two amendments to a 2018 appropriations bill Thursday that attempt to strip Kushner of his clearance.

426,##########,http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2628970,Election law experts divided over Trump Jr. meeting was illegal,['Carolyn Kaster'],Washington Examiner,"Did Donald Trump Jr. violate federal law when he accepted a meeting with Russian individuals under the pretense of obtaining from them opposition research on Hillary Clinton compiled by the Kremlin?

His father, President Trump, certainly doesn't think so, and has argued that a presidential campaign in a similar position would have taken the meeting, which occurred in June 2016, as he was preparing to formally accept the GOP nomination.

At least one prominent Republican election lawyer in Washington, Charlie Spies, agrees with the president on the issue of whether Donald Trump Jr. broke the law or ran afoul of Federal Election Commission regulations.

""For there to be a problem, he would have either had to have received something of value … or have solicited something of value,"" Spies said. ""I don't believe the FEC has ever considered [information] to be something of value.""

The president's eldest son in June of last year was offered through interlocutors damaging information on Clinton, then on her way to becoming the Democratic nominee.

Via emails that have since been made public, Trump Jr. was told that the Russian government had gathered material on Clinton that it wanted to provide to help his father in the campaign.

Trump Jr. accepted the meeting, held at Trump Tower in Manhattan, and was joined by top Trump advisor Jared Kushner, now a senior White House hand, and Paul Manafort, brought onto the campaign last year to help Trump win the battle for GOP nominating delegates.

Manafort was elevated to campaign manager later that month before being fired in August.

Trump Jr. has said that the promise of opposition research didn't pan out and that he didn't walk away with a physical file or other tangible, usable information. But Common Cause, a liberal public interest organization, disagrees and has filed complaint with the FEC and the Department of Justice

The group alleges that Trump Jr.'s discussions about setting up the meeting with the individual who proposed, now viewable in the disclosed emails, plus the meeting itself, amount to solicitation, and acceptance, of something of value from a foreign source.

Candidates for federal office are prohibited by law from soliciting, accepting, anything of value from foreign individuals or entities.

""The email thread undercuts the claims he's made,"" Paul S. Ryan, Common Cause vice president for policy and litigation, said, of Trump Jr.

Common Cause has since amended its complaints to include Kushner, Manafort and Rob Goldstone, the British publicist acting as the interlocutor for the meeting with the Russian individuals who were advertised as having connections to Moscow.

Ryan explained why he disagreed with Spies on the issues of solicitation and whether something of value was received:

""I would point you to the actual email from [Trump Jr.] to Goldstone on June 3 at 10:53 [in which he said] ‘Could we do a call first thing next week when I am back?,'"" Ryan said. ""That is [Trump Jr.] requesting and asking for the information that was offered. That is the solicitation.""

Some Republican election law experts disagree. They say that for solicitation and receipt of value to occur, Trump Jr. would have had to instigate the meeting, rather than be approached, and he would have had to receive an opposition research file in some physical form, whether paper file or thumb drive, for example.

Otherwise, all sorts of conversations with campaign supporters could be construed as resulting in the receiving of something of value. For instance, a campaign aide is talking to an activist or donor who recommends a strategy, and in doing so imparts a piece of information.

The meeting has nevertheless intensified scrutiny of the Trump team as a special counsel and several congressional committees investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, including the question of whether there was any collusion between Russian meddlers and the president's campaign."

Earlier Tuesday, Trump Jr. published an email exchange he had with Rob Goldstone, a British publicist, that showed the pair corresponding about a meeting with a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, last year.

Goldstone told Trump Jr. the lawyer had damaging information about Hillary Clinton, which was part of the Russian government's efforts to help the Trump campaign.

Trump Jr., former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner ultimately met with Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in June 2016, but Trump Jr. said the meeting didn't yield any information about Clinton.

The emails between Trump Jr. and Goldstone marked a turning point in the investigations into Russian meddling in the election, as Democrats argued the correspondence showed that the Trump campaign may have colluded with Russian officials.

One of the witnesses was William Browder of Hermitage Capital Management.

In 2008, Browder's lawyer Sergei Magnitsky discovered a $230 million corruption scheme by numerous Russian officials. The Magnitsky Act was passed by Congress in response to this corruption scheme.

Trump's former campaign chairman turned over his notes, typed on a cellphone, to special counsel Robert Mueller and to the House and Senate Intelligence committees.

NBC News originally reported Thursday Manafort's notes included the words ""donation"" and ""RNC"" in close proximity. However, an update of that report said that a spokesman for the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, disputed that ""donation"" makes an appearance. Grassley's staff reportedly had reviewed the notes.

When NBC News reached out again to two sources that it originally cited, they said ""donation"" was not the right word. The report said one source claimed that the word was ""donor"", while the other would only say that the word referenced political contributions.

It is illegal for foreigners to donate to U.S. campaigns.

""It is 100 percent false to suggest this meeting included any discussion of donations from Russian sources to either the Trump campaign or the Republican Party. Mr. Manafort provided the Senate Intelligence Committee with the facts and his notes so this speculation and conjecture is pointless and wrong,"" Manafort spokesperson Jason Maloni told the Washington Examiner.

Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and son-in-law Jared Kushner also attended the Trump Tower meeting, which was originally said to be about adoptions.

When news broke of the meeting, the president helped write a statement for his son, describing the gathering as ""a short introductory meeting.""

""I asked Jared and Paul to stop by,"" the statement said. ""We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.""

Gowdy said the Russia issue has distracted the GOP-controlled Congress from advancing its agenda.

""There is a political component to it, which is: Here you are in mid-July asking me about Russia, and it's not your fault that you're doing it, but that's how another week is starting here, so that's a political concern,"" he said. ""You're not here to ask me about infrastructure or tax reform or anything about that.""

""President Trump had no choice but to sign the bill to avoid even more humiliation than he suffered during Obamacare failure at the hands of his own Republican Party voting to override his veto,"" Lanny Davis, special counsel to Clinton and an attorney specializing in crisis management, told the Washington Examiner.

Davis argues the sanctions do not negate Trump's encouragement of Russia during the campaign to hack into Hillary Clinton's email server, and publish whatever they may have found.

""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump said during a July 2016 news conference. ""I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.""

The long-time Clinton ally said the White House's admission that Trump helped his son, Donald Trump Jr., write a statement explaining a meeting he had last year at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer will likely overshadow any actions he takes against Russia.

""On Monday, we know he intervened to issue a willfully false public statement and is now open to criminal investigation for possible obstruction of justice and cover-up,"" Davis said.

Some Republicans agree that Trump was forced to sign the sanctions not because he wanted to but due to what they consider the media's fixation with the Russia storyline.

""I would be lying if I said Trump was not backed into a corner on signing the sanctions bill because of the media's obsession with Russia,"" Ford O'Connell a Republican strategist and former adviser to John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, told the Washington Examiner.

While O'Connell believes signing the sanctions were the right thing to do, he expressed a fear many conservatives have that the newly imposed measures against Moscow could hurt the administration down the road.

""If it were not for the Russia/2016 election storyline, Trump should not have signed the bill. Not because Russia should not be punished for its actions in the 2016 election, Ukraine, etc., but because the bill encroaches on the president's foreign policy powers as outlined in Article II of the Constitution. In essence, ceding presidential authority to a dysfunctional Congress could come back to bite not only the Trump administration but also America with the bevy of problems brewing all over the globe,"" O'Connell added."

Trump, Jr. said in a statement that he met with Veselnitskaya, who made some vague statements about Clinton and the Democratic National Committee working with the Russian government.

But, the man who he was emailing with has seen the focus shift on to him as well, unveiling details about his bizarre life.

Rob Goldstone is the man who arranged the meeting for Trump, Jr., campaign adviser Jared Kushner and campaign manager Paul Manafort. He was the recipient of the now-infamous email from the eldest Trump son stating ""if it's what you say, I love it"" when told the Russian government had incriminating information on Hillary Clinton.

Goldstone is a 57-year-old former tabloid journalist and publicist originally from Manchester, England. He lives in New York City but has previously lived in Sydney and has traveled around the world through his work in the music industry.

According to Oui 2, Michael Jackson hired him to accompany the ""Bad Tour"" for five shows during its Oceania leg in the fall of 1987. In 1991, Goldstone moved to the U.S. after he was hired as head of international marketing by HMV, an entertainment retailer.

After seven years in that position, Goldstone co-founded Oui 2 Public Relations with David Wilson. The outfit has done business with numerous musicians and major corporations like EMI, Best Buy, and the Friars Club.

Oui 2 organized several A-list events in recent years, including the Lifetime Achievement Award Gala honoring Martin Scorsese and the Friars Club Roasts of Quentin Tarantino and Betty White.

On Nov. 9, 2013, Oui 2 coordinated its most consequential event in the entertainment world: the Miss Universe pageant.

The show, then-owned by Donald Trump, was held in Moscow and hosted by Emin Agalarov, a Russian pop star represented by Goldstone. Emin's father is Russian oligarch and business developer Aras Agalarov, who first met Trump in Jan. 2013, according to the New York Times.

The same month as the pageant, Aras was awarded the Order of Honour by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

While the pageant garnered new record ratings lows, the event served as a basis for how Goldstone became involved in the Trump campaign three years later. Trump held a press conference with both Agalarovs, cameoed in a music video for Emin that would be released two weeks later and was even spotted fist-pumping by Goldstone.

Days after the event, Trump praised Emin and Aras in a pair of tweets. Goldstone openly praised Trump throughout the years, supporting his presidential campaign from his initial announcement in June 2015 through his victory in November 2016. In April, Goldstone posted a picture of Emin golfing with Trump captioned, ""Throw back Sunday when we played PGA tournament at Trump Doral in Florida with Emin Agalarov and Donald Trump.""

Since the New York Times story broke, many businesses and people connected to Goldstone have gone silent on social media. Oui 2's Twitter account is protected and currently has only 495 followers, while his personal Instagram account is private.

However, Goldstone's personal Facebook page has remained active and publicly accessible, documenting his travels over the years until just before the scandal broke. Goldstone's last Facebook activity was on July 9 when he checked into Athens, Greece and posted a picture of him with the title ""The Emperor Muppettus Maximus.""

Goldstone's profile provides some insight into the person who first approached Trump Jr. with ""official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary [Clinton]"" all as ""part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.""

Over the years, Goldstone had 88 Facebook check-ins in Moscow, including a week before and after his meeting at Trump Tower. On the day of the meeting, Goldstone checked in on Facebook with the caption ""Preparing for meeting.""

His profile displays an eclectic taste, highlighted by his one ""liked"" athlete: Nacho Figueras, an Argentinian known as the ""David Beckham of polo."" He ""likes"" three movies: ""Me Before You,"" ""Batman v. Superman"" and ""Winnie the Pooh."" He has reviewed two restaurants: issuing a one-star review for a restaurant in Sao Paolo that served an ""awful Vietnamese stir fry"" and a five-star review for a gastropub in Harrisburg, Penn.

Goldstone also likes hats and selfies, taking pictures of his unique style interests, including a shared fashion sense with Ivanka Trump.

Goldstone's future remains unclear but he has generated international media coverage for his unexpected involvement with the Trumps. His friends, many surprised with the level of interest, have written on his wall, with one adding: ""You're going to need a publicist bro…""

""The fact of the matter, as I said before, this meeting was ill-advised,"" Christie said on CNN, adding that ""everybody in retrospect knows this was a bad idea.""

He said that had Trump Jr. reached out to Don McGahn, who served as counsel to Trump's campaign and is now serving in the White House, he would have advised against the meeting.

The meeting in question took place in the summer of 2016, and involved people affiliated with the Trump campaign, including Jared Kusher, President Trump's son-in-law and adviser. Emails revealed last month that show it was set up with the promise of dirt on Hillary Clinton, though Trump Jr. claims that the meeting with Kremlin-linked lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, ""went nowhere"" on that front. He also said his father, then a presidential candidate, had no knowledge of the meeting.

Though there has been conflicting statements about what Trump knew, and when, by the White House and Trump's legal team, Christie stressed that people should not get ahead of themselves about possible collusion with the Russian government.

""My view on this is this is why we have people looking into it. It's not for us to make conclusions beforehand,"" he said. ""It's to let [special counsel] Bob Mueller and his team do the investigation and then let's have the facts come out. I think everyone will be better served by that."""
435,8/1/17 0:00,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/white-house-trump-weighed-in-on-trump-jrs-response-to-russia-meeting,White House: Trump 'weighed in' on Trump Jr.'s response to Russia meeting,['Kathy Willens'],Washington Examiner,"White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday that President Trump helped his son, Donald Trump Jr., write a statement explaining a meeting he had last year at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer.

The Washington Post reported that the president was involved in writing that ""misleading"" statement, but Sanders said the statement is true.

""The statement that Don Jr. issued is true. There's no inaccuracy in the statement,"" Sanders said Tuesday. ""The president weighed in as any father would based on the limited information that he had. This is all discussion of no consequence.""

The Post reported Monday night that Trump personally dictated the statement from his son, which said the 2016 meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was related to a ban on adoptions by American families of Russian children.

But Sanders said Trump ""certainly didn't dictate,"" and only ""weighed in.""

Trump Jr.'s statement was called into question after it was revealed the president's son decided to meet with Veselnitskaya after he was promised damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Also in attendance at the June 2016 meeting were former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law.

Lawyers for Trump have in the past refuted any notion that the president was involved in the drafting of Trump Jr.'s statement.

""I do want to be clear the president was not involved in the drafting of the statement and did not issue the statement. It came from Donald Trump Jr., so that's what I can tell you because that's what we know,"" Jay Sekulow, a member of the president's outside legal team, told NBC News last month.

During the press briefing Tuesday, Sanders placed blame on Democrats for continuing to push stories about the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and said the American people are not interested in the probe, which Trump has described as a ""witch hunt"" and ""fake news.""

""Democrats want to continue to use this as a PR stunt and are doing everything they can to keep this story alive and in the papers every single day,"" Sanders said. ""The American people, they voted America first and not Russia first, and that's the focus of the administration.""

Sanders also accused the press of misleading the public by continuing to push the narrative that the president and his campaign colluded with Russia.

""The only thing I see as misleading is a year's worth of stories that have been the fueling false narrative about this Russia collusion, a phony scandal based on anonymous sources,"" she said. ""If we want to talk about misleading, that's the only thing that's misleading in this entire process."""

Akhmetshin is a Russian-American lobbyist believed to have ongoing ties to Russian intelligence operations. He was named as a lobbyist for an organization trying to rescind the 2012 Magnitsky Act.

Akhmetshin was also named in a complaint against the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation and others, filed by Hermitage Capital Management with the Justice Department last year.

Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin met with Donald Trump Jr., former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and Trump son-in-law and now-White House senior adviser Jared Kushner on June 9.

A publicist connected to the Trump business through the Miss Universe pageant, Rob Goldstone, set up the meeting between Veselnitskaya and Donald Trump Jr., with the promise that the meeting would hold negative information about Hillary Clinton coming from the Russian government.

Veselnitskaya, who has been linked to the Kremlin, waited until Friday before admitting to NBC News someone else accompanied her to Trump Tower, where she pivoted from the promise of dishing dirt on Hillary Clinton to lobbying the Trump campaign on adoption policy as it relates to Russia.

438,##########,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/_wGGay0zhBQ/,Leaked Email: Clinton Campaign ‚ÄòKilled‚Äô Bloomberg Story Linking Bill‚Äôs $500k Moscow Speech To Russia-Friendly Stance,['Aaron Klein'],Breitbart,"TEL AVIV — A leaked email from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign previously published by Wikileaks may take on new significance because it relates to key issues brought up in media reports about Donald Trump Jr. and a meeting with a Russian lawyer.

The email in question was purportedly sent by Jesse Lehrich, a Clinton campaign foreign policy spokesman and member of the campaign’s rapid response communications team.

In the correspondence, which has not yet received news media attention and remains searchable in the WikiLeaks archive, Lehrich writes that the campaign “killed a Bloomberg story” attempting to link Clinton’s opposition to the anti-Russia legislation known as the Magnitsky Act to a speech that Bill Clinton delivered in Moscow for $500,000.

The May 21, 2015 message, titled, “May 21st Nightly Press Traffic Summary,” was purportedly sent by Lehrich to the campaign’s “HRCRapid” Google group, and was captured by the leaking of campaign chairman John Podesta’s Gmail account emails.

Lehrich’s list of press actions carried out by the campaign included this:

With the help of the research team, we killed a Bloomberg story trying to link HRC’s opposition to the Magnitsky bill to a $500,000 speech that WJC gave in Moscow.

Based on Peter Schweizer’s bestselling book Clinton Cash, the New York Times in April 2015 reported on Clinton’s $500,000 speech in Moscow and its possible ties to a deal in which the Russians gradually assumed control of the Uranium One mining company.

The newspaper reported “the sale gave the Russians control of one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the United States.”

The newspaper further reported:

Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.

The Magnitsky Act, strongly opposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, is intended to sanction Russian officials accused of involvement in the 2009 death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, an anti-corruption whistleblower who died in prison, allegedly after being beaten.

As Foreign Policy magazine noted, the Obama administration – with Clinton as secretary of state – initially balked in 2010 when Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) introduced the Magnitsky bill, fearing the legislation could harm the much touted “reset” attempt between the U.S. and Moscow.

Clinton helped lead the charge against the bill, the magazine reported. “The administration, starting with Hillary Clinton and then John Kerry, did everything they could do to stop the Magnitsky act,” said American hedge fund manager Bill Browder, who was instrumental in lobbying Congress in favor of the bill.

In a piece titled, “Hillary Clinton forgets her part in a disastrous Russia policy,” Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin referred to Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, asking, “Why did the State Department try to block the Magnitsky Act for so long?”

In 2012, the bill was passed when powerful lawmakers demanded the Magnitsky Act be grouped with the administration’s legislative push to repeal the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, a move that would ease U.S.-Russia trade relations because the law denied Moscow the ability to trade normally with the U.S.

On June 20, 2012, Clinton wrote an oped in the Wall Street Journal titled “Trade With Russia Is a Win-Win,” in which she sought to explain that retaining Jackson-Vanik “only fuels more anti-American sentiment in Russia.”

“Russia’s membership in the WTO (World Trade Organization) will soon be a fact of life,” she stated. “Failing to extend permanent normal trading relations will not penalize Russia, nor will it provide a lever with which to change Moscow’s behavior.”

In the oped, Clinton referred to Magnitsky’s death and wrote, “We are continuing to work with Congress on addressing these issues.”

Despite the questions raised about Clinton’s initial opposition to the Magnitsky Act, her actions to ease trade restrictions on Russia, and her husband’s ties to entities close to the Uranium One deal, former Clinton Campaign Press Secretary Brian Fallon took to CNN on Tuesday to accuse President Trump of enacting foreign policy toward Russia that may be “part of a quid pro quo based on help that was provided during the campaign.” No evidence has emerged of any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

The Magnitsky legislation, meanwhile, has been in the news cycle over the past few days in regard to the story about Trump Jr. and his meeting with a Russian lawyer.

The issue emerged on Saturday when the New York Times published an exclusive story citing “confidential government records described to the New York Times” alleging that Trump Jr. arranged a meeting at Trump Tower two weeks after Trump secured the Republican nomination with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian attorney who, the newspaper claimed, “has connections to the Kremlin.”

The Times subsequently published what it says are the contents of correspondence indicating that the meeting with Veselnitskaya was set up by third parties who claimed that Veselnitskaya had dirt on Clinton. It would not be abnormal for a political campaign to take a meeting with an individual claiming to have compromising information on an opponent.

Instead of providing dirt on Clinton, Trump Jr. said that Veselnitskaya used the time to complain about the Magnitsky Act.

“The woman, as she has said publicly, was not a government official,” Trump Jr. said in a statement on Tuesday. “And as we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act. To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue. As Rob Goldstone said just today in the press, the entire meeting was ‘the most inane nonsense I ever heard. And I was actually agitated by it.’”

In an interview with NBC News, Veselnitskaya denied that she is connected to the Kremlin.

Trump Jr. subsequently released a chain of emails that showed how the meeting was set up.

439,##########,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/7wg87utZ6Gw/,New York Times Omits Clinton State Department Link to Trump Jr. Meeting,['Aaron Klein'],Breitbart,"TEL AVIV — A Russian translator who worked on behalf of the State Department, including during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State, was reportedly present at the June meeting at Trump Tower with President Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr.

On Friday, the New York Times reported that Rinat Akhmetshin, a U.S. lobbyist and former Soviet military serviceman, was present for the brief meeting with Trump Jr.

Akhmetshin identified an individual named Anatoli Samachornov as being the Russian translator who was present at the meeting at which Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya reportedly argued against the Magnitsky Act, which sanctions Russian officials. The meeting was reportedly presented to Trump Jr. as being about information regarding Hillary Clinton. Veselnitskaya reportedly does not speak English and has given interviews to U.S. news media outlets through translators in recent weeks.

Samachornov would not confirm to the New York Times that he was present at the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, only admitting that he was working with Veselnitskaya on efforts related to opposing the Magnitsky Act during the time of the meeting at Trump Tower.

The Times did not provide any background on Samachornov beyond reporting his name and that he was a “translator.”

Samachornov is more than that. According to his LinkedIn profile, from 2005 until recently, Samochornov was a project manager at the Meridian International Center, which describes itself as a “nonprofit, global leadership organization headquartered in Washington, DC.”

Meridian is a principal partner of the U.S. State Department.

Samochornov’s LinkedIn profile says he was an interpreter and a “partner/owner” in Interpreter Boutique, which provided translation services.

The LinkedIn profile further describes his work on behalf of the State Department, purportedly while he was at Meridian. The timeline of his work at Meridian includes the period when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.

Samochornov’s LinkedIn profile lists the following activities:

Represented the U.S. Government in securing cooperation of key U.S. resources in the corporate, governmental and NGO community.

Collaborated with the U.S. and international aid agencies and stakeholders on devising business plans and training workshops on a variety of different topics.

Samochornov was listed as the program administrator for the State Department’s International Visitor Leadership Program, which is implemented by Meridian. Breitbart News found the draft program book for the March 4-12, 2013 leadership initiative, which listed a State Department email for Samochornov.

An email sent to the State address listed for Samochornov, samochornovav@state.gov, did not bounce back, indicating the address could still be active.

Samochornov was also listed as the “Program Officer” for the State Department’s International Visitor Leadership Program in February 2010. The FBI’s New York field office participated in that month’s program.

Samochornov’s number at the International Visitor Leadership Program is still functional. It is answered by a message from Samochornov saying he will be away starting December 24, 2014 “until further notice.”

Efforts to reach Samochornov for comment, including on his personal cell phone and via the WhatsApp application, were unsuccessful.

A phone and email request for comment to Medirian’s communications department about Samochornov’s employment at the group was not returned before press time.

A complaint sent to the Justice Department from Hermitage Capital Management, an investment fund that specializes in Russian markets and was founded by Magnitsky Act primary proponent William Browder, listed Samochornov as a “Russian born professional interpreter and project manager for the U.S. State Department.”

The Magnitsky Act, strongly opposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, is intended to sanction Russian officials accused of involvement in the 2009 death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, an anti-corruption whistleblower who died in prison, allegedly after being beaten. Magnitsky was hired by Browder’s Hermitage Capital to investigate alleged fraud involving Russian officials.

Russia in turn later accused Browder and Magnitsky of evading taxes, and Browder was convicted in absentia by a Moscow court in 2013. Browder has denied any wrongdoing.

The Daily Beast reported on some of Samochornov’s possible ties to Veselnitskaya related to the repeal of the Magnitsky Act:

In February, an organization calling itself the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, an obvious echo of the full name of the Magnitsky Act, was registered in Delaware. Little trace of the activities or provenance of this organization exist online, apart from its “under construction” website, whose homepage is written in ungrammatical English. …

The Daily Beast has seen an email sent to the Open Dialog Foundation, a Poland-based NGO, from a man named Anatoli Samochornov, who claimed to “represent” HRAGIF along with Natalia Veselnitskaya, identified in the email as “a Russian lawyer who conducted an extensive investigation of the Magnitsky case.”

Both Samochornov and Veselnitskaya were seeking press accreditation to attend an event last month at the Open Dialog Foundation where Browder was slated to speak. They were denied accreditation.

The meeting with Trump Jr., meanwhile, was reportedly set up by publicist Rob Goldstone, who claimed in an email to Trump Jr. that Veselnitskaya had opposition dirt on Hillary Clinton.

Veselnitskaya told the Wall Street Journal that she approached Russian real estate magnate Aras Agalarov, whom she was representing, to help set up a meeting with the Trump campaign as part of her efforts opposing the Magnitsky Act. She was also looking to spread information about Browder, she said.

Agalarov organized the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow when the pageant was partially owned by Donald Trump.

Agalarov’s son Emin, a Russian singer who also knows the Trumps, reached out to Goldstone, his publicist, to contact the Trump campaign on behalf of Veselnitskaya, according to the Journal report.

Speaking to Fox News last week, Trump Jr. explained that he took the meeting, which he said lasted around 20 minutes, thinking it was about “opposition research” on Clinton and was disappointed that it wasn’t.

“For me this was opposition research,” Trump Jr. said. “They had something, you know, maybe concrete evidence to all the stories I’d been hearing about … so I think I wanted to hear it out. But really it went nowhere and it was apparent that wasn’t what the meeting was about.”

Trump Jr. spoke about the contents of the meeting. “It was this, ‘Hey, some DNC donors may have done something in Russia and they didn’t pay taxes.’ I was like, ‘What does this have to do with anything?’”

Trump Jr. told Fox News that Goldstone apologized for wasting the campaign’s time with the meeting.

“I think what happened [is] he sort of goosed up, he built up, there was some puffery to the email, perhaps to get the meeting, to make it happen,” Trump Jr. said. “In the end, there was probably some bait-and-switch about what it was really supposed to be about.”

Speaking to the Journal, Veselnitskaya indicated there was a mix up about the intent of the meeting: “My expectation before the meeting was he read my letter of information, he got interested, and he was going to help me. His expectations were totally different, as I can understand now.”

“By the time I stepped into the meeting room to talk with Donald Trump Jr., all I knew was that I approached the elder Mr. Agalarov with a request to help,” Veselnitskaya said. “And I knew his son Emin communicated with Donald Trump Jr.”

440,##########,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/07/30/senate-hearing-on-fusion-gps-delivers-setback-to-russia-collusion-narrative/,Senate Hearing Delivers Setback to Democrats‚Äô Russia Collusion Narrative,['Kristina Wong'],Breitbart,"Democrats’ narrative that that President Trump colluded with Russia during his campaign suffered a severe setback after a credible Russia critic gave sworn testimony in Congress last week that received little mainstream news media coverage.

William Browder, a U.S.-born investor who helped pass a U.S. sanctions law against Russia, testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday that:

1) Fusion GPS — the firm hired by Trump’s political enemies to create the infamous Trump dossier — also ran a smear campaign against him on behalf of Russia; 2) Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya’s meeting with Donald Trump Jr. in June 2016 was only part of Russia’s larger efforts to get the sanctions law known as the Magnitsky Act repealed; and 3) The Russians were not necessarily acting in support of Trump, and were trying to reach out to everyone they could about repealing the Magnitsky Act — not just Trump Jr.

Browder detailed GPS Fusion co-founder Glenn Simpson’s efforts to smear him, even though Simpson said he had just provided “litigation support”:

Glenn Simpson was calling a number of journalists pitching a story to the journalists pitching a story to the journalists … that [Magnitsky] had not been murdered but he died of natural causes, he wasn’t a whistleblower, that he was a criminal, the story I told was incorrect and therefore it should be repealed. I know he was pitching that story because a number of journalists came to me to ask me about it. He was unsuccessful for the most part in getting that story written.

Browder’s testimony not only discredited Fusion GPS itself but raised questions as to whether the document used by the FBI to open an investigation on Trump’s campaign was Russian disinformation.

“What you need to understand about the Russians is there is no ideology at all,” Browder said. “Vladimir Putin is in the business of trying to create chaos everywhere.”

Trump on Saturday tweeted a Fox News story on the hearing, adding, “In other words, Russia was against Trump” in the election.

In other words, Russia was against Trump in the 2016 Election – and why not, I want strong military & low oil prices. Witch Hunt! https://t.co/mMSxj4Su5z — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

Notably, Fusion GPS has refused to reveal who first paid the firm to do the opposition research against Trump. Its co-founder Glenn Simpson was invited to testify at the hearing but has declined to do so in public.

Browder’s testimony also put Trump Jr.’s June 2016 meeting in the context of Russia’s years-long and wide-ranging lobbying efforts to repeal the Magnitsky Act. Democrats have argued the meeting was really about dangling the prospect of collusion, despite any evidence there were follow-up meetings.

“The interest and the goal in that meeting was to repeal the Magnitsky Act,” Browder said. “That’s the one thing we can conclude with certainty about what happened in that meeting.”

Browder explained to senators exactly why repealing the Magnitsky Act is Putin’s “single most important foreign policy,” versus some gateway to collusion. He explained that Putin stood to personally lose money under the sanctions, as well as cronies he had promised to protect. Putin was “infuriated” by the sanctions, he said, prompting him to ban U.S. adoptions of Russian children.

“He can no longer guarantee absolute impunity. All of a sudden we created consequences in the West I would not underestimate,” Browder said. “Targeted sanctions are a hundred times more upsetting to the Russian kleptocracy than broad sanctions.”

Browder also said that Veselnitskaya’s “main life project” was repealing the Magnitsky Act.

During the hearing, Democrats repeatedly tried to lead Browder into agreeing that Trump Jr. and other campaign representatives knew that when Veselnitskaya brought up “adoptions” during the meeting that they knew it meant lifting the sanctions and receiving something in return.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), who asked Browder: “Adoption is in effect code for talking about lifting sanctions … is there any reason that anybody in the president’s circle should know that?”

Browder responded: “I can’t speak to their frame of mind.”

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) followed up, asserting that “adoptions” was a literal “code word” for lifting the Magnitsky Act and that the Trump campaign expected to receive something “of value” in exchange. He said:

When I was a federal prosecutor we sometimes did wiretaps, and we overheard mobsters using code words for dollars like “tomatoes” and “fish.” In this case, “adoption” was referring to the thing of value which for Vladimir Putin was lifting sanctions, which meant money to him. And for other participants in the meeting it was referring to something of value to them and the promise to them made in e-mails was that they would have damaging information.

Browder cautioned Blumenthal against believing that the Russians had actually promised anything in advance for lifting the sanctions and said that, even if they had, it wouldn’t be credible.

“The Russians are liars,” Browder said.

Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL) called fellow Democratic Senator Blumenthal’s comments “extraordinary” and asked if there were any indications that the Trump campaign had more similar meetings.

Browder responded that he didn’t know of any more meetings and added that the Russians were all over Washington making similar pitches.

“The Russians were all over Capitol Hill and here in Congress trying to get meetings with members of Congress to try to make the same type of pitch. Unsuccessfully in the end, but they were here en masse,” he said.

Blumenthal then suggested Browder did not know of any more meetings because he didn’t have access to classified information that “might” be available to the special counsel. He also suggested that when Trump Jr. got the email about the meeting, it would be like Putin himself would be in the meeting, to which Browder said he would have assumed that, but he could only speak for himself.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who is leading the Judiciary committee’s probe into Russian interference, pushed back against the Democrats’ suggestions.

“I’m 100 percent certain in the Trump world of June 2016, they didn’t know that adoptions meant Magnitsky Act. Trust me, I don’t think they knew that,” said Graham — no big fan of Trump.

During the hearing, Browder himself expressed doubt that Russia’s efforts to repeal the Magnitsky Act had anything to do with the presidential election.

Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) asked Browder “with regard to the Russian government’s continuing efforts and Ms. Veselnitskaya’s efforts to repeal or weaken the Magnitsky Act, how did that fit into their broader campaign to interfere in the 2016 election?”

Browder responded, “Well, it’s not clear to me how the two are exactly related.”

“We know what they wanted, which was to have the Magnitsky Act repealed. Whether there was any — perhaps they thought that the probability of that was higher with their preferred candidate than the less preferred candidate,” he said.

“I’m not 100 percent certain they wouldn’t have made the same attempt with the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton. The Russians are nonpartisan when it comes to interference in foreign policy and U.S. affairs. They would gladly talk to — try to bribe and try to blackmail anybody,” he added."
441,##########,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/1S_W24a-oSE/,Russian Lawyer Who Met with Donald Trump Jr. Worked with Democrats for Years,['Kristina Wong'],Breitbart,"The revelation that Donald Trump Jr. met for 20 minutes at Trump Tower with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June 2016 has skyrocketed her to mainstream news media notoriety.

Although she has been painted by Democrats as a Russian government official, numerous reports and photos show she has a long record of working with U.S. political figures, including many Democrats.

For example, The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group revealed on Wednesday that California Rep. Ron Dellums was a hired lobbyist for Veselnitskaya.

According to a Washington Post story, she worked for years on a case with Glenn Simpson, the founder of Fusion GPS, a firm that produced a widely discredited dossier against Trump.

She also worked with Christopher Cooper, the founder and CEO of Potomac Square Group, which has had Democratic clients including California Government Jerry Brown, Democratic presidential nominee Howard Dean, and Joe Trippi, according to the Daily Caller.

And it was Obama’s Attorney General Loretta Lynch that granted her an extension in late 2015 to stay in the U.S. after her visa was due to expire, under “extraordinary circumstances” related to defending a case in New York, according to the Hill. She was granted an extension through January, but it’s not yet clear how she was able to be in the U.S. in June 2016, when she met with Trump Jr., and again January 2017.

Four days after her meeting with Trump Jr. on June 9, 2016, she was in Washington, D.C. for a movie screening of an anti-Magnitsky Act film at the Newseum with at least five congressional staffers and State Department officials, according to the Hill.

The next day she attended a House hearing, sitting in the front row behind Obama’s former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, who was testifying, according to photos of the hearing. McFaul has taken to Twitter to claim that Republicans placed her there, apparently next to his family members, and has denied any meetings with her.

Around that time, Veselnitskaya also attended a dinner with the chairman of the House subcommittee overseeing Russia policy, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), and about 20 other guests, according to the Hill. Rohrabacher said he believed she and Dellums were there lobbying other lawmakers to reverse the Magnitsky Act.

The Magnitsky Act, opposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, imposes sanctions on Russia for alleged human rights violations connected to the death of a Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who had claimed to uncover fraud by the Kremlin.

Veselnitskaya appears to have been inside Sen. John McCain’s office in December 2015, according to a photo of a man and the Arizona Republican senator she uploaded to Facebook.

While critics have accused her of being a high-level Russian agent trying to help the Trump administration, there is no indication she ever wanted to help the Trump campaign, and there are indications she actually opposed Trump’s election.

Veselnitskaya appears to have attended an anti-Trump rally on January 21, according to pictures posted on her Facebook page. Protesters held signs saying “Impeach Trump” and portraying him as close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Just three days before her meeting with Trump Jr., Veselnitskaya twice tweeted an article headlined “NY Attorney General: Trump University Is a Straight Up Fraud Case,” according to a Twitter account appearing to belong to her. Another time, she tweeted out a story on Clinton vowing to win the Democratic nomination despite losing a primary race to opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

And both she and Trump Jr. have said nothing came of the meeting. According to emails released by Trump Jr., he believed she would have incriminating information on Hillary Clinton. However, Veselnitskaya told NBC News this week that she was there as part of a lobbying campaign to reverse the Magnitsky Act.

It was Rob Goldstone, whom the Trumps had known from the 2013 Miss Universe Pageant in Moscow, that suggested there was incriminating evidence through a client of his that was allegedly close to Putin.

Legal scholars from across the political spectrum agree that Trump Jr. did not do anything illegal, even if the meeting looked bad on Trump Jr.’s part.

Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, told The Daily Beast that the emails between Goldstone and Trump Jr. setting up the meeting “are absolutely shocking but they don’t in themselves prove [Donald Trump Junior] committed a crime.”

As the narrative that Trump Jr. did something illegal is crumbling, Trump critics are now arguing that whether the meeting was illegal is less important than whether it was part of a larger attempt by the Russian government to recruit Trump Jr. or “dangle” the prospect of collusion.

But it is far from clear how connected she actually tis o the Kremlin. The New York Times described her as a “Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer,” but a recent Bloomberg column described her as “low-level” and “no Kremlin power broker.”

“It’s entirely possible that a Kremlin effort to help Trump beat Hillary Clinton reached to lower levels because that’s where it was easiest to establish contact with Trump’s family,” wrote Bloomberg columnist Leonid Bershidsky, who describes Veselnitskaya as an important figure only in the Moscow Region, outside of Moscow city itself.

“But it’s more likely that Veselnitskaya, the tenacious and ambitious lawyer who could pull every string in the Moscow Region, did so to get her pet issue — the repeal of the Magnitsky Act, which was getting her major client in trouble — in front of some important Americans.

The New York Times reported late Saturday that Donald Trump Jr., along with then-campaign chair Paul Manafort and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, met with a Russian lawyer with connections to the Kremlin at Trump Tower.

The Times reported that the meeting occurred on June 9, and it notes that this is the first confirmed private meeting between a Russian national and a member of Trump’s inner circle. Reps for Trump Jr. and Kushner confirmed the meeting to the Times but described it as primarily about an adoption program.

The lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, has reportedly been fighting the Magnitsky Act — an American law that blacklists Russian human rights abusers and triggered Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt American adoptions of Russian children.

In a statement to the Times, Trump Jr. said the “short” meeting involved discussion of “a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.”

Circa also reported that the meeting was short, lasting only 20 minutes. The outlet also reported that the president’s legal team believe the meeting may have been part of an election-year opposition effort to create the appearance of “improper connections” between Trump and Russia.

Mark Corallo, a spokesman for President Trump’s legal team, told Circa:

We have learned from both our own investigation and public reports that the participants in the meeting misrepresented who they were and who they worked for. Specifically, we have learned that the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS, a firm which according to public reports, was retained by Democratic operatives to develop opposition research on the President and which commissioned the phony Steele dossier.

“These developments raise serious issues as to exactly who authorized and participated in any effort by Russian nationals to influence our election in any manner,” he added.

The Times reports that the meeting was not disclosed until recently, when Kushner filed a revised version of a form to obtain a security clearance. Kushner’s advisers described the omission as an error.

Kushner’s lawyer told the Times in a statement.:

He has since submitted this information, including that during the campaign and transition, he had over 100 calls or meetings with representatives of more than 20 countries, most of which were during transition. Mr. Kushner has submitted additional updates and included, out of an abundance of caution, this meeting with a Russian person, which he briefly attended at the request of his brother-in-law Donald Trump Jr. As Mr. Kushner has consistently stated, he is eager to cooperate and share what he knows.

The Times notes that Trump Jr. does not have to disclose foreign contacts as he does not serve in the administration, nor does he have a security clearance. The story claims that the lawyer is a “formidable operator with a history of pushing the Kremlin’s agenda.”

The introductory email, written in June 2016 by publicist Rob Goldstone, referred to an offer from the “Crown prosecutor of Russia” who “offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”

The email continued: “This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”

Trump, Jr. responded: “[I]f it’s what you say I love it.”

Here’s my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com/x050r5n5LQ — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017

The Times reported the existence of the introductory email on Monday evening, though it had not seen the email, did not possess the email, did not verify the email, and relied on second-hand descriptions from “three people with knowledge of the email,” presumably from the intelligence community or from one of the intelligence committees in Congress.

(On Tuesday morning, it proclaimed: “The Times now has the email to Donald Trump Jr. offering Russian aid to ‘incriminate Hillary’,” after Donald Trump, Jr. had made the email available to the general public.)

Donald Trump, Jr. accompanied the release of the email chain with a statement in which he stated that he thought the lawyer had “Political Opposition Research” on Clinton, and that the meeting had taken place “before the current Russian fever was in vogue.” He reiterated that the lawyer “had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act.” He did not comment on the publicist’s statement that the information was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”

The email does not refer to any cooperation, coordination or collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

Saturday on Fox News Channel’s “Justice,” Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz defended President Donald Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., for meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya to do opposition research.

According to Dershowitz, there is nothing wrong with a candidate getting information on his opponent from any type of source.

“If it were to be prosecuted, the First Amendment would trump. A candidate has the right to get information from whatever source the information comes,” he argued.

Dershowitz also pointed out, “If the material was obtained unlawfully, you prosecute, if you can, the people who obtain the material. But there is a First Amendment right of a candidate to use information. You can’t include information under the campaign finance law. That would be unconstitutional.”

Natalia Veselnitskaya has been in the headlines in recent days after the New York Times, calling her a “Kremlin-linked lawyer,” reported on a meeting she had at Trump Tower in June with Trump Jr., then-campaign chair Paul Manafort, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.

While the meeting itself focused on the Russian ban on adoption of Russian children by American parents, emails from Trump Jr. show that he was promised information that would compromise Hillary Clinton, purportedly as part of a Russian effort to help his father. Trump critics claim this represents an attempt at collusion by Trump Jr.

In the letter sent Tuesday, Chuck Grassley notes that Natalia Veselnitskaya said she was denied a visa to the U.S. and that, while she was subsequently granted “immigration parole” to travel in 2015, her parole expired on January 7, 2016, and a request to extend was denied. Yet she was able to meet with Trump Jr. at Trump Tower in June.

“It is unclear how she was still in the country for that meeting despite being denied a visa beforehand and her parole purportedly expiring on January 7, 2016. This raises serious questions about whether the Obama administration authorized her to remain in the country, and if so, why?” Grassley says.

Grassley’s letter notes that Veselnitskaya’s alleged role in efforts to undermine American sanctions as part of her lobbying against the Magnitsky Act was cited in a complaint that she was one of a number of Russian agents who failed to register as such under the Foreign Agent Registration Act.

In his letter, Grassley requests information about how the lawyer was able to stay in the U.S. at least until the meeting in June. He also requests information on any visa applications Veselnitskaya made, any visas she held and under what category, as well as any denials she received. It also asks which government agencies, if any, requested parole for Veselnitskaya.

Lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was first denied a visa in 2015 but was then allowed a special “parole” in September 2015 to provide advice — not legal services — during a trial over alleged money laundering by a Russian executive, Denis Katsyv and his company, Prevezon.

Her unusual parole was extended until February 2016, and she subsequently got a temporary business visa from former President Barack Obama’s deputies in June 2016 despite the first denial.

“If you have to be paroled into the country, that means by definition that you’re inadmissible,” said Jessica Vaughn, an immigration expert at the Center for Immigration Studies. She continued:

People who are unqualified for entry are given a special exemption… on case-by-case basis because of a request by law enforcement. It happens, it is not unccommon, but what is uncommon is for that person who was given an exemption for a specific purpose to remain after that purpose [is over] … that is very unusual.

After arriving, Veselnitskaya began working for Katsyv to eliminate the Magnitsky Act, which an economic-sanctions law named after a Russian business leader who died under suspicious circumstances. She failed in that task, despite hiring several Democratic activists, including former Rep. Ron Dellums, plus a Russian-born PR fixer.

According to a July 2016 complaint by a private sector company, and released by Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate’s judiciary committee:

The complaint by Hermitage Capital Management misidentified Dellums as a Republican.

The eventual 20- to 30- minute meeting in June 2016 with Donald Trump Jr. was intended by Veselnitskaya to persuade Donald Trump to kill off the Magnitsky Act if he were to be elected president, according to the Washington Post. The meeting was arranged by a music-industry lawyer, Rob Goldstone, who has at least one Russian client.

The 2015 parole given by the Department of Homeland Security to Natalia Veselnitskaya to attend the money-laundering trial is unusual partly because she provided no legal services that could have not also been provided by via video, said Vaughan.

The DHS has not explained the reasons for the parole, but has described the process in a brief July 14 statement:

In Sept. 2015, DHS paroled Natalia Veselnitskaya into the U.S. in concurrence with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Southern District of New York, allowing her to participate in a client’s legal proceedings. She was issued a Significant Public Benefit Parole document on Sept. 25, 2015.

Even more unusually, Veselnitskaya’s parole was extended and then converted into a formal visa, effectively overturning the unexplained reasons for denying her a visa in 2015, said Vaughan.

According to DHS, “Ms. Veselnitskaya was subsequently paroled into the U.S. several times between 2015 and 2016, ending in February 2016. In June 2016, she was issued a B1/B2 nonimmigrant visa by the U.S. Department of State.”

That B1/B2 visa allowed her into the United States to meet with Trump Jr. in June 2016."

Lee Zeldin’s office fired back at Rosie O’Donnell on Friday after the comedian and longtime Trump nemesis called the congressman a “lying sack of sh*t” on her Twitter account Thursday.

O’Donnell repeatedly attacked Rep. Zeldin (R-NY) in several Twitter messages, calling him a “moron” whose career is “over.”

HEY REP LEE ZELDIN – SHUT UP – U SOUND LIKE A MORON – DEFENDING TRUMP – UR CAREER IS OVER @RepLeeZeldin — ROSIE (@Rosie) July 13, 2017

thats not the ""fact pattern"" – @RepLeeZeldin u r a lying sack of shit lee — ROSIE (@Rosie) July 13, 2017

In a statement to Breitbart News on Friday, Jennifer DiSiena, communications director for Rep. Zeldin, said the congressman would not be “deterred” by O’Donnell’s “ugly” attacks.

“Congressman Zeldin is fighting for his constituents and the American people,” DiSiena said. “He unapologetically wants our President and country to be successful and won’t be deterred by these ugly attacks on social media.”

Zeldin drew the ire of O’Donnell by appearing on MSNBC Thursday to defend Donald Trump Jr.’s reported meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya in June, which sparked renewed allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government when it was revealed this week.

“It is important to point out that nothing happened at the meeting that was illegal,” Zeldin told MSNBC’s Katy Tur. “The hysteria that has resulted where some members of Congress as a result will file articles of impeachment against the President is ridiculous. Senator Kaine calling it treason – I mean give me a break. So, we should just assess this for what it is.”

“As far as the president goes, we should be supportive of him, most importantly because we want our country to be successful,” he added. “It’s okay to disagree, where we disagree with an approach on a particular issue on health care, and taxes, and our veterans. It is important for us to have a substantive productive debate when we disagree, but the fact that the President’s hand was on the bible, the entire parade route of people with ‘Impeach him now’ signs, I would say that there are extremes here at play. It would be helpful if we could bridge that gap.”

O’Donnell has feuded publicly with Trump for much of the past decade.

The comedian and former View host has kept up her criticism of the Trump administration on social media since the election. On Friday, O’Donnell tweeted that Trump is “guilty” and “illegitimate,” though she did not specify a crime for which Trump would be guilty.

448,##########,https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/07/16/russian-feud-spilled-campaign-politics/,Report Details How a Long-Running Russian Feud Spilled Over to Campaign Politics,['Kristina Wong'],Breitbart,"New details in a report by the Wall Street Journal highlight how a meeting between a Russian lawyer and Donald Trump Jr. had more to do with a years-long feud between Russia and U.S.-born hedge fund manager William Browder than it did anything else.

The report, published Saturday, details the long-running feud and how the White House got sucked into it. It said:

The multiyear saga between Russia and Mr. Browder has featured accusations of murder and fraud, extensive lobbying efforts on both sides, high-level court proceedings and public statements by Russian President Vladimir Putin suggesting Mr. Browder is a criminal. And now, the drama has extended to the Trump White House, which is already facing probes into the campaign’s relationship with Russia.

According to the report, Natalia Veselnitskaya, a private lawyer and former Russian prosecutor who was defending a client charged with violating the Magnitsky Act, told the paper that she sought a meeting last year with the Trump campaign to spread information about Browder, a champion of the Act.

She asked Aras Agalarov — a Russian-Azerbaijani property developer who organized the 2013 Miss Universe pageant with Trump in Moscow — for help in arranging a meeting with the Trump campaign. Veselnitskaya had done some real estate-related legal work for Agalarov’s company over the years, Agalarov family lawyer Scott Balber said.

Veselnitskaya, who has been described in the media as a “Kremlin-connected lawyer,” apparently did not have her own connections to Trump, who had recently officially become the GOP nominee.

Veselnitskaya told the Wall Street Journal that Trump Jr. was only one of several people she petitioned in her effort to have the Magnitsky Act repealed and to discredit Browder.

Agalarov’s pop-star son Emin then had his publicist, Rob Goldstone, reach out to Trump Jr. to arrange the meeting.

Goldstone then emailed Trump Jr., alleging that the elder Agalarov had recently met with Russia’s “Crown Prosecutor,” and wanted to provide the Trump campaign incriminating information on Trump’s campaign opponent Hillary Clinton.

It’s not clear why Goldstone made that assertion.

No “Crown Prosecutor” exists in Russia, but it is believed to be the Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika. Agalarov’s attorney told the Wall Street Journal he did not meet with Chaika, as was suggested in the email. Agalarov himself on Wednesday called that assertion “some kind of fiction.”

Veselnitskaya also told the paper that the meeting was not about Clinton. She also did not make it a secret that she shared information about Browder regularly with Chaika and his office.

“I personally know the general prosecutor,” she told the WSJ. “In the course of my investigation [about the fund manager], I shared information with him.”

But she said Chaika did not request that she meet with Trump Jr., and Chaika’s office told the paper that it “does not exchange information and does not conduct any meetings at the international level outside the framework regulated by international legal agreements and Russian procedural legislation.”

Veselnitskaya said she asked Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist who has also lobbied against the Magnitsky Act to join her in the meeting. She said when she stepped into the room to meet with Trump Jr., all she knew was that she had asked Agalarov to arrange a meeting with him and that his son had helped arrange it.

She told the paper she wanted to inform the Trump campaign of allegations that an American firm Browder worked with — Ziff Brothers Investments — did not pay taxes in Russia and had donated to Democrats.

She said Trump Jr. wasn’t interested in the information. The article points out that Trump Jr. expressed disappointment on Fox News that the information boiled down to an American firm donating to the Democratic National Committee that didn’t pay Russian taxes.

“I was like, ‘What does this have to do with anything?’” Trump Jr. said.

Veselnitskaya expressed disappointment too: “My expectation before the meeting was he read my letter of information, he got interested, and he was going to help me. His expectations were totally different, as I can understand now.”

Browder himself suggested the meeting was part of the coordinated Russian government attempt to undermine him and the Magnitsky Act.

“They were on a major full-court press on all fronts with Congress, with the press … with Trump Jr.,” Browder said. “I think that she’s working hand in glove with Chaika, and it’s all part of a coordinated strategy back at headquarters.”

The feud between Russia and Browder started about a decade ago.

Browder, the U.S.-born manager of Hermitage Capital, a London-based hedge fund, hired Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky. Magnitsky accused Russian officials of defrauding his firm in Russia out of $230 million in a tax scheme.

Magnitsky was then arrested in 2008 by Russian authorities for allegedly helping Hermitage Capital underpay taxes and for masterminding the fraud he uncovered.

Browder was barred entry into Russia, and Magnitsky later died in prison in November 2009. Independent investigators said he died of torture and was denied medical treatment.

Browder lobbied for the successful 2012 passage of the Magnitsky Act, which sanctioned Russian officials who contributed to the death of Magnitsky. It was expanded in 2016 to include human rights abusers anywhere. The law allows the U.S. to add Russian human rights violators easily to a U.S. sanctions list, even if they had no part in the Magnitsky case.

Russia was angered by the passage of the law, banned American adoptions of Russian children in return, and has waged a public relations war against Browder. A Russian court has convicted Browder in absentia for tax evasion, and state-run Russian TV has aired investigations about him.

Veselnitskaya, as a private attorney, represented Denis Katsyv, the Russian owner of Prevezon Holdings, a Cyprus-based hotel and real-estate group, who was accused of violating the Magnitsky Act.

Katsyv was charged in the U.S. after investigators had suspected Prevezon used funds from the $230 million fraud scheme Magnitsky uncovered to buy New York real estate. Prevezon was charged by Preet Bharara, then-U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York and friend of former FBI Director James Comey.

That case brought Veselnitskaya to the U.S. in late 2015. As her visa was about to expire in September, the U.S. Attorney General’s office extended it through January. She was able to extend her stay again through June 2016, and during that time, she met with Trump Jr., Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), and attended a House hearing, among other activities in Washington.

The U.S. and Prevezon reached a $5.9 million civil settlement in April. Trump asked Bharara to leave in March, along with 46 other U.S. attorneys.

Browder has denied Veselnitskaya’s and the prosecutor general’s office’s accusations, calling them “stale and disproven,” and part of a well-resourced, Moscow-coordinated campaign to undermine him and the Magnitsky Act.

Browder filed a complaint with the Justice Department in July 2016 that accused Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin of violating U.S. lobbying laws by not registering their activities.

Browder is due to appear in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday for a hearing on enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act."
449,##########,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/_8Xl-w6ko9A/,Washington Post Contradicts Most Infamous Claim In ‚ÄòPeeing Russia Prostitutes‚Äô Anti-Trump Dossier,['Aaron Klein'],Breitbart,"TEL AVIV — Information contained in a Washington Post article may disprove perhaps the most infamous claim made in the already discredited 35-page dossier on President Donald Trump.

The dossier in question was authored by former intelligence agent Christopher Steele, who was reportedly paid by Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans to investigate Trump. Steele recently conceded in court documents that part of his work still needed to be verified.

One of the most widely reported claims inside the document was that while Trump was staying in the presidential suite at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Moscow in 2013, he hired “a number of prostitutes to perform a ‘golden showers’ (urination) show in front of him.”

The dossier claims that Trump wanted to “defile” the bed because he learned that President Obama had used the same suite during a trip to Russia.

The document claims that the hotel “was known to be under FSB control” and that that there were concealed cameras and microphones throughout the property, suggesting Russia possessed damaging photos or videos on the current U.S. president. The FSB is the principal Russian security agency.

Trump reportedly stayed at the Ritz Carlton when he was in Moscow to judge the Miss Universe contest, which he partially owned at the time.

On Tuesday, the Washington Post reported that while he was in Russia, Trump spent time with Aras Agalarov, a Russian billionaire real estate tycoon, and Argalorov’s son, singer Emin. Trump was reportedly discussing the possibility of building a tower in Moscow with the elder Argalorov. The Argalorovs attended the Miss Universe contest.

Buried inside the article, the Post quoted “a person with knowledge” of Trump’s 2013 trip saying that Trump’s bodyguard rejected an offer from Emin Agalarov to send prostitutes to Trump’s hotel room.

The article is titled, “Unlikely middlemen: Trump Jr. emails point to father-son duo.”

The newspaper reported:

A person with knowledge of the 2013 trip to Moscow said Emin Agalarov offered to send prostitutes to Trump’s hotel room, but the repeated offers were rejected by Keith Schiller, Trump’s longtime bodyguard. The person with knowledge of the trip insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized by Trump to publicly discuss the matter.

This would have been the same hotel where the dossier claims Trump engaged in a “golden shower” escapade with Russian prostitutes.

Major questions have been raised as to the veracity of the dossier, large sections of which have been discredited.

Citing a “Kremlin insider,” the dossier, which misspelled the name of a Russian diplomat, claimed that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen held “secret meetings” with Kremlin officials in Prague in August 2016.

That charge unraveled after Cohen revealed he had never traveled to Prague, calling the story “totally fake, totally inaccurate.” The Atlantic confirmed Cohen’s whereabouts in New York and California during the period the dossier claimed he was in Prague. Cohen reportedly produced his passport showing he had not traveled to Prague.

In testimony in May, former FBI Director James Comey confirmed that the basis for the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia allegedly wanted Trump in office was not because the billionaire was, as Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) claimed during a hearing, “ensnared in” Russia’s “web of patronage” – as the dossier alleged. Instead, the FBI chief provided two primary reasons for Russia’s alleged favoring of Trump over Clinton during the 2016 presidential race.

One reason, according to Comey, was that Putin “hated” Clinton and would have favored any Republican opponent. The second reason, Comey explained, was that Putin made an assessment that it would be easier to make a deal with a businessman than someone from the political class.

Comey’s statements are a far cry from the conspiracies fueled by the dossier alleging Putin held blackmail information on the billionaire.

Citing current and former government officials, the New Yorker reported the dossier prompted skepticism among intelligence community members, with the publication quoting one member saying it was a “nutty” piece of evidence to submit to a U.S. president.

Steele’s work has been questioned by former acting CIA Director Michael Morell, who currently works at the Hillary Clinton-tied Beacon Global Strategies LLC.

According to the BBC, the dossier served as a “roadmap” for the FBI’s investigation into claims of coordination between Moscow and members of Trump’s presidential campaign.

In April, CNN reported that the dossier served as part of the FBI’s justification for seeking the FISA court’s reported approval to clandestinely monitor the communications of Carter Page, the American oil industry consultant who was tangentially and briefly associated with Trump’s presidential campaign.

Senior Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have reportedly requested that the FBI and Department of Justice turn over applications for any warrants to monitor the communications of U.S. citizens associated with the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

In testimony last month, Comey repeatedly refused to answer questions about his agency’s ties to the dossier.

In testimony last month to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Comey admitted he pushed back against a request from Trump to possibly investigate the origins of “salacious material” that the agency possessed in the course of its investigation into alleged Russian interference.

Author and journalist Paul Sperry reported in the New York Post last week that, this month, the Senate Judiciary Committee threatened to subpoena Fusion GPS, the secretive firm that hired Steele to produce the dossier because the firm reportedly refused to answer questions about who financed the dossier.

Sperry raised further questions regarding possible connections between Fusion GPS and Hillary Clinton:

Fusion GPS was on the payroll of an unidentified Democratic ally of Clinton when it hired a long-retired British spy to dig up dirt on Trump. In 2012, Democrats hired Fusion GPS to uncover dirt on GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. And in 2015, Democratic ally Planned Parenthood retained Fusion GPS to investigate pro-life activists protesting the abortion group.

Moreover, federal records show a key co-founder and partner in the firm was a Hillary Clinton donor and supporter of her presidential campaign.

In September 2016, while Fusion GPS was quietly shopping the dirty dossier on Trump around Washington, its co-founder and partner Peter R. Fritsch contributed at least $1,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund and the Hillary For America campaign, Federal Election Commission data show. His wife also donated money to Hillary’s campaign.

450,##########,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/sD4GOFe_sAE/,Trump Accuses Comey of Attempting to Leverage ‚ÄòPeeing Russia Prostitutes‚Äô Dossier,['Aaron Klein'],Breitbart,"In a wide-ranging interview with the New York Times published yesterday, President Donald Trump accused former FBI Director James Comey of possibly trying to leverage the contents of the now infamous, largely discredited 35-page dossier compiled on the billionaire.

The Times reported:

Mr. Trump recalled that a little more than two weeks before his inauguration, Mr. Comey and other intelligence officials briefed him at Trump Tower on Russian meddling. Mr. Comey afterward pulled Mr. Trump aside and told him about a dossier that had been assembled by a former British spy filled with salacious allegations against the incoming president, including supposed sexual escapades in Moscow. The F.B.I. has not corroborated the most sensational assertions in the dossier.

In the interview, Mr. Trump said he believed Mr. Comey told him about the dossier to implicitly make clear he had something to hold over the president. “In my opinion, he shared it so that I would think he had it out there,” Mr. Trump said. As leverage? “Yeah, I think so,” Mr. Trump said. “In retrospect.”

The dossier in question was authored by former intelligence agent Christopher Steele, who was reportedly paid by Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans to investigate Trump. Steele recently conceded in court documents that part of his work still needed to be verified.

According to information first leaked by CNN, Trump was briefed on the contents of the controversial dossier last January by Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers.

There are questions about the veracity of Comey’s public explanations of why he briefed Trump, President Obama and other top Obama administration officials about the dossier contents. Comey claimed that he and other U.S. officials briefed Obama and Trump about the dossier two weeks prior to Trump’s inauguration because they wanted to alert the president and president-elect that the news media were about to release the material.

In June testimony, Comey specifically denied that he had briefed Trump about “salacious and unverified material” – referring to the dossier – in order to “hang it over him in some way.”

Comey stated:

I was briefing him about salacious and unverified material. It was in a context of that that he had a strong and defensive reaction about that not being true. My reading of it was it was important for me to assure him we were not personally investigating him. So the context then was actually narrower, focused on what I just talked to him about.

It was very important because it was, first, true, and second, I was worried very much about being in kind of a J. Edgar Hoover-type situation. I didn’t want him thinking I was briefing him on this to sort of hang it over him in some way.

I was briefing him on it because we had been told by the media it was about to launch. We didn’t want to be keeping that from him. He needed to know this was being said. I was very keen not to leave him with an impression that the bureau was trying to do something to him. So that’s the context in which I said, sir, we’re not personally investigating you.

In his prepared remarks before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June, Comey also detailed why he claimed the intelligence community briefed Obama and Trump on the “salacious material” – again a clear reference to the dossier.

Comey wrote:

The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.

The U.S. intelligence community does not usually brief top officials about pending news media coverage.

Also, according to numerous reports, the media had been aware of the dossier claims for months. The dossier charges had been circulating among news media outlets, but the sensational claims were largely considered too risky to publish.

When it famously published the full dossier, BuzzFeed reported that the contents had circulated “for months” and were known to journalists.

The website reported, “The documents have circulated for months and acquired a kind of legendary status among journalists, lawmakers, and intelligence officials who have seen them. Mother Jones writer David Corn referred to the documents in a late October column.”

McClatchy reported this week that it was among “at least a dozen national media organizations” that “had a copy of the Steele dossier before it became public but hadn’t published details because much of the information had not been corroborated.”

Despite Comey’s claims about pending media stories on the dossier, it was actually Comey’s very briefings to Trump and Obama that gave the news media the opening to start publishing the dossier contents, as this reporter previously documented.

On January 10, CNN cited “multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings” – in other words, officials leaking information about classified briefings – revealing the dossier contents were included in a two-page synopsis that served as an addendum to a larger report on Russia’s alleged attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

Just after that CNN report, BuzzFeed published the dossier’s full unverified contents.

The New York Times used CNN’s story to report some contents of the dossier the same day as CNN’s January 10 report on the briefings.

After citing the CNN story, the Times reported:

The memos describe sex videos involving prostitutes with Mr. Trump in a 2013 visit to a Moscow hotel. The videos were supposedly prepared as “kompromat,” or compromising material, with the possible goal of blackmailing Mr. Trump in the future.

The memos also suggest that Russian officials proposed various lucrative deals, essentially as disguised bribes in order to win influence over Mr. Trump.

The memos describe several purported meetings during the 2016 presidential campaign between Trump representatives and Russian officials to discuss matters of mutual interest, including the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta.

Immediately following CNN’s article, National Intelligence Director Clapper added fuel to the media fire around the dossier by releasing a statement that he spoke to Trump to express “my profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press” – referring to the leaks to CNN about the classified briefing. He called the leaks “extremely corrosive and damaging to our national security.”

Clapper’s statement generated fresh media coverage of the dossier briefings.

Largely discredited

Major questions have been raised as to the veracity of the dossier, large sections of which have been discredited.

Earlier this month, Breitbart News reported that information contained in a Washington Post article may disprove perhaps the most infamous claim made in the already discredited dossier.

One of the most widely reported claims in the document was that while Trump was staying in the presidential suite at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Moscow in 2013, he hired “a number of prostitutes to perform a ‘golden showers’ (urination) show in front of him.”

The dossier claims that Trump wanted to “defile” the bed because he learned that President Obama had used the same suite during a trip to Russia.

The document states that the hotel “was known to be under FSB control” and there were concealed cameras and microphones throughout the property, suggesting Russia possessed damaging photos or videos on the current U.S. president. The FSB is the principal Russian security agency.

Trump reportedly stayed at the Ritz Carlton when he was in Moscow to judge the Miss Universe contest, which he partially owned at the time.

Earlier this month, the Washington Post reported that while he was in Russia, Trump spent time with Aras Agalarov, a Russian billionaire real estate tycoon, and Argalorov’s son, singer Emin. Trump was reportedly discussing the possibility of building a tower in Moscow with the elder Argalorov. The Argalorovs attended the Miss Universe contest.

Buried inside the article, the Post quoted “a person with knowledge” of Trump’s 2013 trip saying that Trump’s bodyguard rejected an offer from Emin Agalarov to send prostitutes to Trump’s hotel room.

Meanwhile, numerous other aspects of the dossier have been discredited. Citing a “Kremlin insider,” the dossier, which misspelled the name of a Russian diplomat, claimed that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen held “secret meetings” with Kremlin officials in Prague in August 2016.

That charge unraveled after Cohen revealed he had never traveled to Prague, calling the story “totally fake, totally inaccurate.” The Atlantic confirmed Cohen’s whereabouts in New York and California during the period the dossier claimed he was in Prague. Cohen reportedly produced his passport showing he had not traveled to Prague.

Citing current and former government officials, the New Yorker reported the dossier prompted skepticism among intelligence community members, with the publication quoting one member saying it was a “nutty” piece of evidence to submit to a U.S. president.

Steele’s work has been questioned by former acting CIA Director Michael Morell, who currently works at the Hillary Clinton-tied Beacon Global Strategies LLC.

According to the BBC, the dossier served as a “roadmap” for the FBI’s investigation into claims of coordination between Moscow and members of Trump’s presidential campaign.

In April, CNN reported that the dossier served as part of the FBI’s justification for seeking a FISA court’s reported approval to clandestinely monitor the communications of Carter Page, the American oil industry consultant who was tangentially and briefly associated with Trump’s presidential campaign.

Senior Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have reportedly requested that the FBI and Department of Justice turn over applications for any warrants to monitor the communications of U.S. citizens associated with the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

In testimony to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Comey admitted he pushed back against a request from Trump to possibly investigate the origins of “salacious material” that the agency possessed in the course of its investigation into alleged Russian interference.

Author and journalist Paul Sperry reported in the New York Post last week that the Senate Judiciary Committee threatened to subpoena Fusion GPS, the secretive firm that hired Steele to produce the dossier, because the firm reportedly refused to answer questions about who financed the dossier.

Sperry raised further questions regarding possible connections between Fusion GPS and Hillary Clinton:

Fusion GPS was on the payroll of an unidentified Democratic ally of Clinton when it hired a long-retired British spy to dig up dirt on Trump. In 2012, Democrats hired Fusion GPS to uncover dirt on GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. And in 2015, Democratic ally Planned Parenthood retained Fusion GPS to investigate pro-life activists protesting the abortion group.

Moreover, federal records show a key co-founder and partner in the firm was a Hillary Clinton donor and supporter of her presidential campaign.

In September 2016, while Fusion GPS was quietly shopping the dirty dossier on Trump around Washington, its co-founder and partner Peter R. Fritsch contributed at least $1,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund and the Hillary For America campaign, Federal Election Commission data show. His wife also donated money to Hillary’s campaign.

The Russian lawyer who penetrated Donald Trump’s inner circle was initially cleared into the United States by the Justice Department under “extraordinary circumstances” before she embarked on a lobbying campaign last year that ensnared the president’s eldest son, members of Congress, journalists and State Department officials, according to court and Justice Department documents and interviews.

This revelation means it was the Obama Justice Department that enabled the newest and most intriguing figure in the Russia-Trump investigation to enter the country without a visa.

Later, a series of events between an intermediary for the attorney and the Trump campaign ultimately led to the controversy surrounding the president’s eldest son.

Just five days after meeting in June 2016 at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr., presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner and then Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Moscow attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya showed up in Washington in the front row of a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Russia policy, video footage of the hearing shows.

She also engaged in a pro-Russia lobbying campaign and attended an event at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. where Russian supporters showed a movie that challenged the underpinnings of the U.S. human rights law known as the Magnitysky Act, which Russian leader Vladimir Putin has reviled and tried to reverse."

Wallace said the White House had a “huge problem with credibility.”

“It’s one more case where there is a new revelation that the White House and Donald Trump Jr., and other people don’t put out themselves, and it ends up coming out from the news media,” Wallace explained.

He added, “I think this is the biggest problem here. I think there is very little legal jeopardy for Donald Trump, Jr., but there is a huge problem with the credibility of the White House because they kept saying there is no collusion, there have been no contacts, this is all a hoax, it is all fake news.

“First of all, when I read the email exchange from Goldstone talking to Donald Trump Jr. about this meeting, I kind of thought it was either a setup or a joke,” said Schweizer. “Because the email so on-the-nose and direct about ‘hey, somebody’s got information to help your dad from the Russian government.’ It’s the sort of thing that speaks of either not a very sophisticated operation, or a hoax.”

“I don’t believe it was a hoax,” he added. “I don’t believe it was a setup. I do believe that this was an attempt to get a meeting with people in Trump’s circle. It does not appear that there was any information that was exchanged.”

“Look, it was a very stupid, dumb thing to even take a meeting,” Schweizer declared. “I think a basic element of Politics 101, I would say, is if somebody comes to you that’s either say Chinese or Russian, in this context, and says ‘we want to give you information to help you win a campaign,’ the best thing for anybody to do is to just stay away. So I think it was an incredibly stupid thing to do.”

Marlow posited that someone in Trump Jr.’s position as a non-politician working in a longshot presidential campaign would be hard-pressed to turn down an offer of blockbuster negative information about the opposing candidate.

Schweizer had a few suggestions for anyone caught in such a position: “First of all, I think you do turn down the meeting. What you can certainly do is say, ‘Look, any information they have that they think is helpful, they can pass along.’ But the optics – particularly such a crude attempt, where they clearly didn’t do any vetting and didn’t have any context of trying to understand who this person was, you’re getting an email that says this is coming from the Russian government – it’s just a bad scenario.”

“That said, Alex, it’s very important for people to know that there are a lot of people in political circles in Washington right now running around apoplectic, pretending like this is some shocking thing. The fact of the matter is, if you look through the expanse of American political history including recent political history, this sort of stuff goes on a lot more than people think,” he continued.

“What I would encourage people to do if they’ve got the time for, I say jokingly, ‘light summer reading,’ pick up the memoirs of Anatoly Dobrynin, who was the dean of the Soviet diplomatic service for 30 years, the Soviet ambassador in Russia,” Schweizer recommended.

“In his memoirs, published in the mid-1990s, he gives hair-raising accounts very calmly told about being approached by the Jimmy Carter campaign in 1980, the Walter Mondale campaign in 1984, conversations that he says he had with Senator Ted Kennedy, in which all of these individuals were saying ‘let’s work together to undermine Reagan’s election and Reagan’s re-election because we have this common opposition to this terrible, evil person,’” he elaborated.

“Especially experienced political hands that are pretending like, ‘Oh my gosh, this has never happened before, this is frightening’ are either completely ignorant of American history, or are putting on a demonstration for political reasons,” he said.

Schweizer assessed the Trump Jr. story as “something that needs to be further looked into,” and “an important lesson for people around the president or anybody in politics.”

“If you are approached in this way from somebody that’s a rival country – and Russia is a rival country, as China is, to the United States – you don’t take these meetings. You don’t have these kinds of conversations,” he advised.

Peter Schweizer is head of the Government Accountability Institute and author of the best-selling book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

454,##########,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/hlwmUANVHJ0/,"Russian Lawyer Who Met with Donald Trump Jr. Denies Kremlin Links, Clinton Info",['Adam Shaw'],Breitbart,"The Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. last year has denied claims that she is linked to the Kremlin in an interview published Tuesday, and says that she didn’t meet with him to hand over information about the Clinton campaign — pouring cold water on the latest attempts to tie the Trump campaign to an alleged Russia conspiracy.

The New York Times has run multiple stories in recent days reporting on a meeting that occurred during the presidential campaign between President Trump’s son and Natalia Veselnitskaya. The Times reported Sunday that Trump Jr. took the meeting in the belief that the participants may have had compromising information on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. joked Monday that he was “the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent.”

Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent… went nowhere but had to listen. https://t.co/ccUjL1KDEa — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 10, 2017

The Times reported Monday that Trump Jr. was informed in an email that the potential information was part of a Russian effort to aid the campaign. It did not publish the email, which was only described to Times reporters.

The Times refers to Veselnitskaya as a “Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer.” But in an interview with NBC News, Veselnitskaya denied any such connection and said she only works to challenge the Magnitsky Act.

The Times has reported that the meeting merely discussed the Magnitsky Act — which imposed sanctions on Russian officials linked to human rights abuses. Russian President Vladimir Putin responded by banning adoption of Russian children by prospective American parents.

Veselnitskaya painted a similar picture. She said that while the participants in the meeting, that included former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, may have hoped for information on Clinton, she offered no such thing.

“I never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton. It was never my intention to have that,” she said.

“It is quite possible that maybe they were longing for such an information. They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted.”

As opposed to a meeting reeking of collusion, Veselnitskaya paints a picture of a short meeting that lasted approximately 20-30 minutes, in which the participants were disinterested. She said Manafort was looking at his phone during the meeting and seemed “absent-minded,” while Kushner left after 10 minutes and Trump Jr. only asked her one question.

“The question that I was asked was as follows: whether I had any financial records which might prove that the funds used to sponsor the DNC were coming from inappropriate source,” she told NBC.

Trump Jr. has mocked the controversy surrounding the meeting. On Tuesday, he called the controversy “nonsense” and suggested it was a sign of desperation from the media and Democrats.

Media & Dems are extremely invested in the Russia story. If this nonsense meeting is all they have after a yr, I understand the desperation! — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017

455,##########,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/GlIDEPLsWxo/,"POLLAK: After Donald Trump Jr. Emails, Still No Evidence of Russia ‚ÄòCollusion‚Äô",['Joel B. Pollak'],Breitbart,"In the three days since Donald Trump, Jr. released the emails he exchanged with British publicist Rob Goldstone about a “Russian government attorney” and the opposition research she might provide on Hillary Clinton, there have been no additional “scoops” — just an endless stream of cable news talking heads offering more speculation.

Absent any further information, there is still no evidence of “collusion” between the Trump campaign and Russia.

In fact, the emails tend to suggest the opposite.

First, there is nothing in the emails that refers to the alleged Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee email server, which had already happened and has been the basis for claims of Russian interference in the 2016 election. (Notably, the hackers had also targeted the Republican National Committee, but the RNC’s defenses were apparently strong enough to withstand the hacking attempt.)

Second, the emails suggest that there was no pre-existing channel between the Trump campaign and Russia. It is highly unlikely that if the Russian government did want to work with Trump, it would use a pop star publicist as an intermediary. Regardless, the emails make no reference to any other kind of existing communication with Russians.

Third, the Russian lawyer provided no information to Donald Trump, Jr. and the others at the meeting, at least according to those present, including the lawyer herself. (Ironically, the information that the publicist claimed the lawyer was going to provide dealt with alleged collusion by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats with the Russians.)

So there was no collusion, based on what is known thus far. In the absence of any evidence of collusion, the media and the Democrats are talking about an “attempt to collude,” which is a meaningless term, legally and literally.

The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines “collusion” as “secret agreement or cooperation especially for an illegal or deceitful purpose.” There was no agreement, no cooperation, and neither the meeting nor its purpose was illegal.

The mere fact that Trump, Jr. was willing to meet with the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya — who also worked with Democrats and a Democrat-linked opposition research firm, Fusion GPS — is being described as nefarious. But there is no evidence that Veselnitskaya was linked to the Kremlin — a charge that the mainstream media continues to repeat as established fact, despite her denials, a complete lack proof, and significant evidence to the contrary.

The fact that the publicist represented her as a “Russian government attorney” seems mere puffery. So, too, does his claim that the Russian government supported Trump, which is typical PR flattery. Goldstone seems to have had no idea what he was talking about with regard to Russia: he referred, for example, to a “Crown prosecutor of Russia,” an office that does not exist. Notably, Donald Trump, Jr. did not acknowledge the suggestion of Russian support.

There are some legitimate questions that the emails raise, such as why the meeting was not acknowledged earlier. That has a reasonable answer — namely, that it is easy to forget a short, inconsequential meeting among hundreds if not thousands of meetings — but the question is not unfair. Similarly, while the emails suggest no collusion before June 2016, they do not say what happened later — although there is no evidence yet of collusion afterwards, either.

Thus, three days in, the story of Donald Trump, Jr.’s emails provides no evidence of “collusion” with the Russians, and is just the latest example of the solipsistic hysteria of Trump’s critics, still desperate to undo the 2016 election.

Priebus called it a developing story and said it might be a “big nothing burger, then warned it “may spin out of control for the DNC and the Democrats.”

Partial transcript as follows:

WALLACE: Right. Let’s start with the breaking news that in June of 2016, there was a previously undisclosed meeting, and let’s up all the players on the screen, Donald Trump, Jr., this was during the campaign, Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior advisor, and then campaign chairman Paul Manafort, met at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin, Natalia Veselnitskaya.

Why did they meet and why are we just learning about it?

PRIEBUS: Well, first of all, Chris, I don’t know much about it other than what I’ve communicated with various members there on the screen. It was a very short meeting. It was a meeting apparently about Russian adoption and after about 20 minutes, the meeting ended and that was the end of it. And as far as nondisclosure, look, Jared Kushner put in his disclosure a little prematurely. He has since amended it. All of that is disclosed, and it was a nothing meeting. And now, what’s developing from that meeting, if you look at the article that Circa put out, is that the individual that set up the meeting may have been affiliated with Fusion GPS, which is opposition research firm that is being subpoenaed and talk to by the Senate Judiciary Committee about their role in putting together that phony dossier that people know about in regard to the president.

So, this is a developing story. I don’t know much about it other than it seems to be on the end of the Trump individuals a big nothing burger but may spin out of control for the DNC and the Democrats.

WALLACE: Well, let me ask you about two aspects of that. In terms of the DNC, are you suggesting that this was somehow a set up by Democrats to try and link them or compromise them with the Russians? And this was before there was any Russian interference in the election. So, why would they have done that?

PRIEBUS: Well, look, why was Fusion GPS involved in putting together this dossier? I don’t know, Chris. And I don’t think too many people know why or how this meeting came about.

However, what I can tell you is in my communication with our team on the subject, there was nothing to it, it was a 20-minute meeting, it ended after everyone was decidedly sitting there saying there’s nothing happening here. They moved on. And I think, in the end, what you’re going to find in the story, if you read the Circa column because I think there’s more questions on the Democrat side than anywhere else.

WALLACE: And one last question about the meeting, why would Donald Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort all want to meet with a Russian lawyer about Russian adoption?

PRIEBUS: I have no idea, Chris. You’re going to have to talk to them. However, you know, talking about issues of foreign policy, issues related to our place in the world, issues important to the American people, like adoption, is something that’s not unusual. So, when you go through a campaign, you’re not just talking to one particular group of people about in this case adoptions in Russia, you have policy teams talking about our place in Asia, talking about trade in China. You have policy teams that run the gamut. It’s not unusual.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: The foreign policy meeting?

PRIEBUS: Apparently so."
457,##########,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/1ZxLhbztn1Y/,Keith Olbermann SCOOP: Trump Is Making the Left Talk About the ‚ÄòPee Pee‚Äô Dossier,['Aaron Klein'],Breitbart,"In a seven-minute online rant, commentator Keith Olbermann fancifully charges that President Trump is “almost solely, almost exclusively, almost entirely” responsible for the news media’s constant coverage of unproven claims of collusion between Russia and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.

The left has for months been perpetuating the Russia collusion conspiracy and spewing stories about the controversial, largely discredited dossier. Yet Olbermann claims that Trump is deliberately fueling the public fixation on what the leftist Internet personality wrongly called the “Pee Pee Tape.” Olbermann suggests that Trump is bringing the headlines back to the dossier issue amidst an avalanche of negative coverage on other matters related to the Trump administration.

He made the comments on his webshow at GQ.com, “The Resistance with Keith Olbermann.”

Watch below:

In Olbermann’s unhinged view, the Russia conspiracy has nearly disappeared from the public dialogue for “days at a time.”

“And yet somehow, always we come back to Russia. And we come back to it almost solely, almost exclusively, almost entirely because of the dedication and the single-mindedness of one man. Donald Trump’s worst enemy on the subject of Russia. Donald Trump.”

“We keep coming back to one specific part of the Russia story that few people besides him seem to take seriously or even think is relevant. ‘The Pee Pee Tape,’” Olbermann exclaimed.

“Boy Scouts, Scaramucci hired, Scaramucci fired, paddy wagons, transgender troops, Priebus, repeal and replace, McCain, Murkowski and go Bannon yourself — all of it in roughly one week — filling the airwaves, consuming the internet, breaking Twitter, causing the Russia story, the dossier, the tape to all recede into the darkness,” Olbermann stated.

“And Donald Trump just pulled it back out and put up 27 more spotlights on it,” Olbermann said with a laugh. “To make sure the pee-pee tape story doesn’t… dry up.”

There is no evidence of any such tape. Olbermann was referring to the infamous 35-page dossier authored by former intelligence agent Christopher Steele, who was reportedly paid to compile the controversial document by the shadowy firm Fusion GPS, which has reported ties to Democrats and is accused of having done work on behalf of foreign state clients.

One of the most widely reported and mocked claims in the document was that while Trump was staying in the presidential suite at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Moscow in 2013, he hired “a number of prostitutes to perform a ‘golden showers’ (urination) show in front of him.”

Olbermann’s conspiracy theory that Trump is driving the Russia narrative to the fore is contradicted by the near constant stream of stories and leaks on the matter, with many being driven by the New York Times, Washington Post, and CNN.

Only two weeks ago, for example, the Washington Post cited alleged U.S. intelligence intercepts leaked by current and former U.S. officials claiming that Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak told his superiors at the Kremlin that he discussed issues related to the 2016 presidential campaign with Jeff Sessions, despite the attorney general’s assertions to the contrary.

The Post story, which fueled continuous headlines, was used last week by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, to call on Sessions to once again testify before the panel, this time to answer claims made in the Post piece. Feinstein’s call is resulting in still more headlines.

This reporter documented how the Post piece contains misleading information, omits key details that may discredit the article’s major assertions, and relies on possibly distorted intercepts as the basis for the central charges.

Meanwhile, Olbermann’s claim that Trump is driving news media coverage of the dossier rests on a single tweet sent out by the U.S. president linking to a Fox News story last week titled, “Firm behind anti-Trump dossier also worked for Russia, Senate witness says.”

In other words, Russia was against Trump in the 2016 Election – and why not, I want strong military & low oil prices. Witch Hunt! https://t.co/mMSxj4Su5z — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

Olbermann asserts that Trump tweeted the story to keep the dossier in the headlines instead of noting that Trump was attempting to shine a light on media hypocrisy regarding the story. After months of misleading stories in the news media surrounding the dossier, Trump was attempting to point out that the news media was ignoring Senate testimony last week in which an expert witness charged that the firm that produced the dossier, Fusion GPS, had previously done work “on behalf of the Russian government.”

Olbermann claimed of the “Pee Pee” dossier story that “few people besides him (Trump) seem to take” it “seriously or even think” it is “relevant.”

Perhaps the former MSNBC host missed that, according to the BBC, the dossier served as a “roadmap” for the FBI’s investigation into claims of coordination between Moscow and members of Trump’s presidential campaign.

Olbermann may have also missed that, in April, CNN reported that the dossier served as part of the FBI’s justification for seeking a FISA court’s approval to clandestinely monitor the communications of Carter Page, the American oil industry investor who was tangentially and briefly associated with Trump’s presidential campaign.

Senior Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have reportedly requested that the FBI and Department of Justice turn over applications for any warrants to monitor the communications of U.S. citizens associated with the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

In testimony in June, former FBI Director James Comey repeatedly refused to answer questions about his agency’s ties to the dossier.

In the same testimony, Comey admitted he pushed back against a request from Trump to possibly investigate the origins of “salacious material” that the agency possessed in the course of its investigation into alleged Russian interference.

In a wide-ranging interview with the New York Times published earlier this month, Trump accused Comey of possibly trying to leverage the contents of the dossier compiled on the billionaire.

Olbermann’s wild claim that Trump has been fueling news media coverage of the dossier is also challenged by the genesis of news media coverage on the topic.

According to information first leaked by CNN, Trump was briefed on the contents of the controversial dossier last January by Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers. That briefing was utilized by the news media to first report on the document.

There are questions about the veracity of Comey’s public explanations of why he briefed Trump, President Obama and other top Obama administration officials about the dossier contents. Comey claimed that he and other U.S. officials briefed Obama and Trump about the dossier two weeks prior to Trump’s inauguration because they wanted to alert the president and president-elect that the news media were about to release the material.

In June testimony, Comey specifically denied that he had briefed Trump about “salacious and unverified material” – referring to the dossier – in order to “hang it over him in some way.”

Comey stated:

I was briefing him about salacious and unverified material. It was in a context of that that he had a strong and defensive reaction about that not being true. My reading of it was it was important for me to assure him we were not personally investigating him. So the context then was actually narrower, focused on what I just talked to him about. It was very important because it was, first, true, and second, I was worried very much about being in kind of a J. Edgar Hoover-type situation. I didn’t want him thinking I was briefing him on this to sort of hang it over him in some way. I was briefing him on it because we had been told by the media it was about to launch. We didn’t want to be keeping that from him. He needed to know this was being said. I was very keen not to leave him with an impression that the bureau was trying to do something to him. So that’s the context in which I said, sir, we’re not personally investigating you.

In his prepared remarks before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June, Comey also detailed why he claimed the intelligence community briefed Obama and Trump on the “salacious material” – again a clear reference to the dossier.

Comey wrote:

The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.

The U.S. intelligence community does not usually brief top officials about pending news media coverage.

Also, according to numerous reports, the media had been aware of the dossier claims months before the briefing. The dossier charges had been circulating among news media outlets, but the sensational claims were largely considered too risky to publish.

When it famously published the full dossier, BuzzFeed reported that the contents had circulated “for months” and were known to journalists.

The website reported, “The documents have circulated for months and acquired a kind of legendary status among journalists, lawmakers and intelligence officials who have seen them. Mother Jones writer David Corn referred to the documents in a late October column.”

McClatchy reported last month that it was among “at least a dozen national media organizations” that “had a copy of the Steele dossier before it became public but hadn’t published details because much of the information had not been corroborated.”

Despite Comey’s claims about pending media stories on the dossier, it was actually Comey’s very briefings to Trump and Obama that gave the news media the opening to start publishing the dossier contents, as this reporter previously documented.

On January 10, CNN cited “multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings” – in other words, officials leaking information about classified briefings – revealing the dossier contents were included in a two-page synopsis that served as an addendum to a larger report on Russia’s alleged attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

Just after that CNN report, BuzzFeed published the dossier’s full unverified contents.

The New York Times used CNN’s story to report some contents of the dossier the same day as CNN’s January 10 report on the briefings.

After citing the CNN story, the Times reported:

The memos describe sex videos involving prostitutes with Mr. Trump in a 2013 visit to a Moscow hotel. The videos were supposedly prepared as “kompromat,” or compromising material, with the possible goal of blackmailing Mr. Trump in the future. The memos also suggest that Russian officials proposed various lucrative deals, essentially as disguised bribes in order to win influence over Mr. Trump. The memos describe several purported meetings during the 2016 presidential campaign between Trump representatives and Russian officials to discuss matters of mutual interest, including the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta.

Immediately following CNN’s article, National Intelligence Director Clapper added fuel to the media fire around the dossier by releasing a statement saying that he spoke to Trump to express “my profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press” – referring to the leaks to CNN about the classified briefing. He called the leaks “extremely corrosive and damaging to our national security.”

Clapper’s statement generated fresh media coverage of the dossier briefings.

Largely discredited

Major questions have been raised as to the veracity of the dossier, large sections of which have been discredited. The dossier’s author, Steele, himself recently conceded in court documents that part of his work still needed to be verified.

Earlier this month, Breitbart News reported that information contained in a Washington Post article may disprove perhaps the most infamous claim made in the already discredited dossier – the peeing Russian prostitutes and a certain hotel room at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Moscow in 2013.

The dossier claims that Trump wanted to “defile” the bed because he learned that President Obama had used the same suite during a trip to Russia.

The document states that the hotel “was known to be under FSB control” and there were concealed cameras and microphones throughout the property, suggesting Russia possessed damaging photos or videos of the current U.S. president. The FSB is the principal Russian security agency.

Trump reportedly stayed at the Ritz Carlton when he was in Moscow to judge the Miss Universe contest, which he partially owned at the time.

The Washington Post reported that while he was in Russia, Trump spent time with Aras Agalarov, a Russian billionaire real estate tycoon, and Argalorov’s son, singer Emin. Trump was reportedly discussing the possibility of building a tower in Moscow with the elder Argalorov. The Argalorovs attended the Miss Universe contest.

Buried inside the article, the Post quoted “a person with knowledge” of Trump’s 2013 trip saying that Trump’s bodyguard rejected an offer from Emin Agalarov to send prostitutes to Trump’s hotel room.

Meanwhile, numerous other aspects of the dossier have been discredited. Citing a “Kremlin insider,” the dossier, which misspelled the name of a Russian diplomat, claimed that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen held “secret meetings” with Kremlin officials in Prague in August 2016.

That charge unraveled after Cohen revealed he had never traveled to Prague, calling the story “totally fake, totally inaccurate.” The Atlantic confirmed Cohen’s whereabouts in New York and California during the period the dossier claimed he was in Prague. Cohen reportedly produced his passport showing he had not traveled to Prague.

Citing current and former government officials, the New Yorker reported the dossier prompted skepticism among intelligence community members, with the publication quoting one member saying it was a “nutty” piece of evidence to submit to a U.S. president.

Steele’s work has been questioned by former acting CIA Director Michael Morell, who currently works at the Hillary Clinton-tied Beacon Global Strategies LLC.

Author and journalist Paul Sperry reported in the New York Post last week that the Senate Judiciary Committee threatened to subpoena Fusion GPS, the secretive firm that hired Steele to produce the dossier, because the firm reportedly refused to answer questions about who financed the dossier.

Sperry raised further questions regarding possible connections between Fusion GPS and Hillary Clinton:

Fusion GPS was on the payroll of an unidentified Democratic ally of Clinton when it hired a long-retired British spy to dig up dirt on Trump. In 2012, Democrats hired Fusion GPS to uncover dirt on GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. And in 2015, Democratic ally Planned Parenthood retained Fusion GPS to investigate pro-life activists protesting the abortion group. Moreover, federal records show a key co-founder and partner in the firm was a Hillary Clinton donor and supporter of her presidential campaign. In September 2016, while Fusion GPS was quietly shopping the dirty dossier on Trump around Washington, its co-founder and partner Peter R. Fritsch contributed at least $1,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund and the Hillary For America campaign, Federal Election Commission data show. His wife also donated money to Hillary’s campaign.

Collusion! the Times cried Sunday: “The meeting — at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016, two weeks after Donald J. Trump clinched the Republican nomination — points to the central question in federal investigations of the Kremlin’s meddling in the presidential election: whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians.”

Notice how the goalposts have shifted. The question of collusion has always concerned Russian efforts to intervene in the 2016 presidential election, allegedly by hacking the Democratic National Committee and other targets.

What the Russian lawyer allegedly offered was entirely different — information “that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Mrs. Clinton,” Trump, Jr. told the Times.

That has nothing whatsoever to do with the hacking allegations, and actually inverts the dominant media narrative, as it suggests that Clinton, not Trump, might have been the one colluding with the Russians in the 2016 election.

Though Trump’s son told the Times that the lawyer “had no meaningful information,” there was already a mountain of evidence that the Russian government had some questionable ties with the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation.

Do the Times, and the Democrats, want to go there?

The Washington Post‘s Callum Borchers called Trump, Jr.’s statements to the Times “stunning.” One version of the Post story used the word “incriminating” in the headline, though there is no crime alleged and none, apparently, took place.

Someone allegedly offered opposition research to the campaign — something that happens all the time, as the Clinton campaign knew well, since it was digging up dirt on Donald Trump anywhere it thought it could find it, including foreign sources.

The Times called the lawyer “Kremlin-connected,” but there is no reason that the Trump team would have suspected that (and the lawyer herself appeared to deny any such connection in the Times article).

For the left, it suffices that a member of the Trump family met with someone from Russia. That is enough to revive the failing Russia conspiracy theory, lighting up social media and setting the mainstream news agenda for the week.

Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) and the party’s legion of mainstream media operatives spent all day Monday speculating about what the Times story might suggest, giving air to all the old conspiracy theories, which have led nowhere.

There is still no evidence of any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The story is a giant red herring — one that will ultimately hurt the media’s credibility and the Democrats’ prospects.

Not only is the story entirely irrelevant to what is known about the issue of Russian election interference, but it will also fuel the Democrats’ intense interest in conspiracy theories, which have crowded out any of the issues that voters care about.

Natalya Veselnitskaya spoke to a Russian TV station about the meeting, which made international news in July when the New York Times reported on the meeting and described Veselnitskaya as a “Kremlin-connected lawyer.”

Trump Jr., who attended the meeting along with President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, later released emails showing that he had taken the meeting in the belief that it would result in compromising information on Hillary Clinton—although he said that no such information was forthcoming.

The revelation of the meeting led to accusations that the Trump team had attempted to collude with Russia over the election, as the pitch to Trump mentioned that the dirt on Clinton was part of a Russian effort to help Trump win in November.

Instead, the conversation reportedly focused on the 2012 Magnitsky Act—an American law that places sanctions on Russian human rights abusers. That law led the Russian government to ban the adoption of Russian babies by American parents. Veselnitskaya has long been an advocate of the repeal of the Magnitsky Act.

According to the Moscow Times, Veselnitskaya told the Rossia-24 channel’s Vesti news program, “I asked for help. Help to spread a story that I had come across in my professional capacity.”

She told the program that she met on behalf of Russian businessman Denis Katsyv, who was reportedly accused of money laundering in the U.S. in connection with the Magnitsky Act. She also said she wanted to tell Trump Jr. about William Browder, the head of Hermitage Capital who successfully lobbied to pass the Magnitsky Act, named after Sergei Magnitsky—who was employed by Browder and died in a Russian prison.

Veselnitskaya accused Browder of a “financial scam,” according to the Times, and described the request as “a completely normal request to everyone who could provide any kind of support in U.S. Congress so that the congressmen would know what really happened in our country with Browder.”

“As I’ve said before, [the meeting] had nothing to do with [Trump’s] rivals or the presidential elections,” Veselnitskaya told the program, according to the Times. “That never happened, that’s not true.”

She also noted that she had not been invited to testify before Congress, despite the immense controversy surrounding the meeting.

“They don’t want the truth there at the moment, they need an enemy,” she said.

The President–who spoke for 35 minutes in the Polish capital last week–still faces claims of “Russian collusion” from the U.S. and British press. Meanwhile, those on the NATO front lines in Europe have declared their belief that the U.S. President will continue to stand with America’s NATO allies.

Speaking to Breitbart News, Sen. Anna Maria Anders, who also serves as the Polish government’s Plenipotentiary for International Dialogue said: “President Trump was incredibly well received. There was a huge amount of excitement and anticipation about his visit and we were not disappointed.

“His speech was incredibly well received by everyone. It was amazing in that it was patriotic, non-partisan, and non-divisive. Before his visit critics said that his visit would isolate Poland from the European Union. Not at all. Unity was a main focus of his speech along with traditional values.”

Asked whether the visit allayed fears promoted by the U.S. press, as well as concerns fuelled by Donald Trump during the campaign itself, that the United States would abandon its NATO allies, Ms. Anders remarked: “[There is a] definite feeling in Poland that White House and the U.S. stands with us.

“Poland had mixed feelings about Trump when he won the Presidency. We were worried about his comments about NATO being obsolete and worried about his apparent friendliness with Putin and Russia. All those fears evaporated with this visit.”

Poland’s Ambassador to the United States Piotr Wilczek told Breitbart News: “President Trump was very well received–as a leader of the most powerful country in the world and as a true leader of the West and defender of Western civilization, based on fundamental, common values.

“We were very impressed by the content and rhetorical mastery. This was undoubtedly the best speech given by an American president in Poland and one of the best public speeches ever delivered by an American leader. We were moved by its deep historical insight and profound understanding of our region.”

On the Russia question, he added: “We feel very reassured. It was an enormously strong statement, not only confirming Article 5 [of the NATO treaty] but also acknowledging the key role of transatlantic alliance of free, sovereign nations.”

President Trump’s speech in Warsaw marked the beginning of a “Trump doctrine” of international relations–the idea that the United States would happily stand alongside its allies, as long as they did not exploit their relationships with the U.S. and contributed fairly into international budgets i.e. NATO.

Even the left-leaning Guardian noted: “Donald Trump used the word “civilisation” 10 times in his first speech in central Europe. The man who brought us “America first” has expanded his vision, to a clash of civilisations.”

They characterised the visit as “pit[ting the] western world against barbarians at the gates”.

Domestically, President Trump and associates remain under a persistent onslaught from an establishment media hell bent on framing his election victory as contingent upon “collusion” with the Russian Federation.

Most recently, the New York Times has seized on an e-mail chain between President Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., and a slovenly publicist by the name of Rob Goldstone, who claimed that Russia was in favour of a Donald Trump victory at the elections in November 2016.

Other nations weighed into the U.S. elections prior to the vote also, with the British Prime Minister David Cameron, as well as Ukrainian officials stating their opposition to Mr. Trump, or preference for a Hillary Clinton presidency.

461,##########,http://www.breitbart.com/news/the-latest-kushner-blames-aide-for-faulty-questionnaire/,The Latest: Kushner blames aide for faulty questionnaire - Breitbart,[],Breitbart,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump and the Russia investigations (all times local):

6:33 a.m.

The son-in-law of President Donald Trump is blaming his assistant for filing a version of his security clearance questionnaire that left off any contacts with foreign governments.

Jared Kushner says the assistant accidentally filed the questionnaire while it was still being prepared. He says the initial form left off all foreign contacts, not just ones with Russians. Kushner says he eventually disclosed more than 100 contacts with people from more than 20 countries. Kushner says that list includes the King of Jordan, the prime minister of Israel and a high-ranking Mexican government official.

Kushner is disclosing the information about his foreign contacts just hours before he speaks behind closed doors with a Senate committee investigating Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election and any possible collusion with Trump associates.

___

6:06 a.m.

The son-in-law of President Donald Trump says a June 2016 meeting with a Russian-American lawyer was such a “waste of time” that he asked his assistant to call him out of the gathering.

That’s according to a statement Jared Kushner is providing to congressional committees this week.

Emails released this month show Donald Trump Jr. accepted the meeting at Trump Tower with the idea that he would receive damaging information about Hillary Clinton. But Kushner says he hadn’t seen those emails until recently shown them by his lawyers.

Kushner says in his statement that Trump Jr. invited him to the meeting. He says he arrived late and heard the lawyer discussing the issue of adoptions. He says he texted his assistant to call him out of the meeting.

___

6:00 a.m.

President Donald Trump’s son-in-law says that he only had four contacts with Russians during the campaign and presidential transition and that none of them were improper.

Jared Kusher also says he never colluded with any foreign government during the presidential campaign. He also is denying that Russians finance any of his business in the private sector.

Kushner is disclosing the information in an 11-page statement provided to The Associated Press. The release of the statement comes just hours before he is to be interviewed by a Senate committee investigating Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election and any possible collusion by Trump associates.

The interview with the Senate intelligence committee is behind closed doors.

___

3:20 a.m.

Congressional investigators probing Russia’s meddling in the U.S. election will have their first opportunity this week to hear from someone in President Donald Trump’s innermost circle: son-in-law Jared Kushner.

Kushner, who is a senior adviser to the president and is married to Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, will talk to staff on the Senate Intelligence Committee Monday behind closed doors. On Tuesday, he’ll talk privately to members of the House Intelligence Committee.

Both panels are investigating Russian interference and possible connections to Trump’s campaign. Kushner has attracted attention for a December meeting with a leading Russian diplomat. He oversaw digital strategy for the campaign, and some lawmakers have said they want more answers about whether Russian social media “trolls” were connected to Trump’s election efforts."
462,##########,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/Iwl7asBifSo/,WATCH ‚Äì Ex-Obama Official Marie Harf on Anti-Trump Dossier: ‚ÄòWe Thought It Was a Funny Salacious Thing‚Äô,['Aaron Klein'],Breitbart,"TEL AVIV — The Obama administration thought the 35-page dossier compiled on President Trump was a “funny, salacious thing,” according to Marie Harf, a former spokesperson and senior official in the State Department under President Obama.

The now infamous, largely discredited 35-page dossier was authored by former intelligence agent Christopher Steele, who was reportedly paid to compile the controversial document by the shadowy firm Fusion GPS, which reportedly has ties to Democrats and has done work on behalf of foreign state clients.

Speaking Friday on The Story with Martha MacCallum, broadcast on Fox News, Harf was attempting to debate the contention that the dossier was at the center of the unfounded charges alleging collusion between Russia and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. There is no evidence of any such collusion.

Harf, who is currently a Fox News contributor, served as acting spokesperson and deputy spokesperson for the State Department and was senior adviser of strategic communications to Secretary of State John Kerry.

During the Fox News program, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor of the Federalist, stated: “At the center of the entire Russia scare has been this dossier, this very salacious document that made all sort of allegations against Trump. Now, a lot of them have been discredited. A lot of stuff has been objectively shown to not be true.”

Here is a transcript of the rest of the exchange (emphasis added):

HARF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I’m very impressed with Mollie’s ability to spin a conspiracy theory out of this. There is no evidence to support what she’s putting forward. Look, I think it’s interesting. It was certainly salacious when it came out. But I would disagree with something she just said, this dossier, while it may have got a lot of attention, isn’t actually what the Russian investigations are about right now. They’re about all these meetings that Trump officials had with the Russians that they were not honest about. They’re about possible ties. And nothing may come from those investigations. But let’s be very clear, they’re not based on that dossier. I have no idea who paid for it. I have no idea where any of this came from. But I suspect there’s some attempt in Congress right now on the Republican side to use this dossier and some of these conspiracy theories.

HEMINGWAY: In fact, this dossier was used by the FBI to secure a FISA warrant against an American citizen. It was also used by Obama officials and intelligence agencies to really get this whole Russian conspiracy going.

HARF: That’s not true, Mollie. I was in the administration. That’s absolutely not true. We thought this was a funny, salacious thing. The Russian investigations started because a bunch of other issues not related.

Contrary to Harf’s claims, the Fusion GPS-produced dossier was reportedly central to the Russia probe.

According to the BBC, the dossier served as a “roadmap” for the FBI’s investigation into claims of coordination between Moscow and members of Trump’s presidential campaign.

In April, CNN reported that the dossier served as part of the FBI’s justification for seeking a FISA court’s approval to clandestinely monitor the communications of Carter Page, the American oil industry investor who was tangentially and briefly associated with Trump’s presidential campaign.

Senior Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have reportedly requested that the FBI and Department of Justice turn over applications for any warrants to monitor the communications of U.S. citizens associated with the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

In testimony in June, Comey repeatedly refused to answer questions about his agency’s ties to the dossier.

In the same testimony, Comey admitted he pushed back against a request from Trump to possibly investigate the origins of “salacious material” that the agency possessed in the course of its investigation into alleged Russian interference.

In a wide-ranging interview with the New York Times published earlier this month, Trump accused former FBI Director James Comey of possibly trying to leverage the contents of the dossier compiled on the billionaire.

According to information first leaked by CNN, Trump was briefed on the contents of the controversial dossier last January by Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers.

There are questions about the veracity of Comey’s public explanations of why he briefed Trump, President Obama and other top Obama administration officials about the dossier contents. Comey claimed that he and other U.S. officials briefed Obama and Trump about the dossier two weeks prior to Trump’s inauguration because they wanted to alert the president and president-elect that the news media were about to release the material.

In June testimony, Comey specifically denied that he had briefed Trump about “salacious and unverified material” – referring to the dossier – in order to “hang it over him in some way.”

Comey stated:

I was briefing him about salacious and unverified material. It was in a context of that that he had a strong and defensive reaction about that not being true. My reading of it was it was important for me to assure him we were not personally investigating him. So the context then was actually narrower, focused on what I just talked to him about. It was very important because it was, first, true, and second, I was worried very much about being in kind of a J. Edgar Hoover-type situation. I didn’t want him thinking I was briefing him on this to sort of hang it over him in some way. I was briefing him on it because we had been told by the media it was about to launch. We didn’t want to be keeping that from him. He needed to know this was being said. I was very keen not to leave him with an impression that the bureau was trying to do something to him. So that’s the context in which I said, sir, we’re not personally investigating you.

In his prepared remarks before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June, Comey also detailed why he claimed the intelligence community briefed Obama and Trump on the “salacious material” – again a clear reference to the dossier.

Comey wrote:

The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.

The U.S. intelligence community does not usually brief top officials about pending news media coverage.

Also, according to numerous reports, the media had been aware of the dossier claims for months. The dossier charges had been circulating among news media outlets, but the sensational claims were largely considered too risky to publish.

When it famously published the full dossier, BuzzFeed reported that the contents had circulated “for months” and were known to journalists.

Axios reported Thursday that members of Trump’s legal team, which includes Trump’s longtime lawyer Marc Kasowitz and conservative lawyer Jay Sekulow, do not want Kushner discussing the Russia probe with Trump in order to protect the president.

“The team contends that it isn’t out to get Kushner, but just wants to protect the president because his son-in-law is so wrapped up in the investigation,” the outlet reported. “He had three meetings with Russians that special counsel Bob Mueller is sure to investigate.”

Kushner was one of three Trump campaign officials, along with Donald Trump Jr. and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who met last June with Natalia Veselnitskaya — a Russian lawyer who advocates for changes in an American law connected to do with sanctions against Russian officials tied to human rights abuses.

Trump Jr. caused a firestorm in the media and on Capitol Hill when he released emails Tuesday showing that he accepted the meeting in the belief that he was going to be passed on “incriminating” information about Hillary Clinton purportedly as part of Russian efforts to help Trump win the election.

The New York Times reported Wednesday that Kushner faces scrutiny as he not only works in the White House (unlike Trump Jr.) but also that he did not mention the meeting on forms he filled out for a background check to obtain a security clearance. Those emails were discovered in recent weeks by Kushner’s legal team, who then amended his clearance forms.

The Times also reports that Trump’s legal team has been “whispering in the president’s ear about the Russia investigations and stories while keeping the lawyers out of the loop.”

“The president’s lawyers view Mr. Kushner as an obstacle and a freelancer more concerned about protecting himself than his father-in-law,” the outlet reported, citing an anonymous source.

The “wall” suggested by the lawyers, would reportedly constitute an agreement by which Kushner does not discuss anything to do with the probe with Trump — a demand that Axios says could fuel tensions between Trump’s lawyers and Kushner’s.

Kushner will cooperate in the next few weeks with the Senate and House Intelligence Committee probes on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. Kushner’s colleagues told the Times that he remains “focused and upbeat” despite the negative headlines — something they put down to his experience dealing with his father Charles, who was convicted of tax evasion and witness tampering.

Saturday on Fox News Channel’s “Justice,” Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz defended President Donald Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., for meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya to do opposition research.

According to Dershowitz, there is nothing wrong with a candidate getting information on his opponent from any type of source.

“If it were to be prosecuted, the First Amendment would trump. A candidate has the right to get information from whatever source the information comes,” he argued.

Dershowitz also pointed out, “If the material was obtained unlawfully, you prosecute, if you can, the people who obtain the material. But there is a First Amendment right of a candidate to use information. You can’t include information under the campaign finance law. That would be unconstitutional.”

The report, published Saturday, details the long-running feud and how the White House got sucked into it. It said:

The multiyear saga between Russia and Mr. Browder has featured accusations of murder and fraud, extensive lobbying efforts on both sides, high-level court proceedings and public statements by Russian President Vladimir Putin suggesting Mr. Browder is a criminal. And now, the drama has extended to the Trump White House, which is already facing probes into the campaign’s relationship with Russia.

According to the report, Natalia Veselnitskaya, a private lawyer and former Russian prosecutor who was defending a client charged with violating the Magnitsky Act, told the paper that she sought a meeting last year with the Trump campaign to spread information about Browder, a champion of the Act.

She asked Aras Agalarov — a Russian-Azerbaijani property developer who organized the 2013 Miss Universe pageant with Trump in Moscow — for help in arranging a meeting with the Trump campaign. Veselnitskaya had done some real estate-related legal work for Agalarov’s company over the years, Agalarov family lawyer Scott Balber said.

Veselnitskaya, who has been described in the media as a “Kremlin-connected lawyer,” apparently did not have her own connections to Trump, who had recently officially become the GOP nominee.

Veselnitskaya told the Wall Street Journal that Trump Jr. was only one of several people she petitioned in her effort to have the Magnitsky Act repealed and to discredit Browder.

Agalarov’s pop-star son Emin then had his publicist, Rob Goldstone, reach out to Trump Jr. to arrange the meeting.

Goldstone then emailed Trump Jr., alleging that the elder Agalarov had recently met with Russia’s “Crown Prosecutor,” and wanted to provide the Trump campaign incriminating information on Trump’s campaign opponent Hillary Clinton.

It’s not clear why Goldstone made that assertion.

No “Crown Prosecutor” exists in Russia, but it is believed to be the Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika. Agalarov’s attorney told the Wall Street Journal he did not meet with Chaika, as was suggested in the email. Agalarov himself on Wednesday called that assertion “some kind of fiction.”

Veselnitskaya also told the paper that the meeting was not about Clinton. She also did not make it a secret that she shared information about Browder regularly with Chaika and his office.

“I personally know the general prosecutor,” she told the WSJ. “In the course of my investigation [about the fund manager], I shared information with him.”

But she said Chaika did not request that she meet with Trump Jr., and Chaika’s office told the paper that it “does not exchange information and does not conduct any meetings at the international level outside the framework regulated by international legal agreements and Russian procedural legislation.”

Veselnitskaya said she asked Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist who has also lobbied against the Magnitsky Act to join her in the meeting. She said when she stepped into the room to meet with Trump Jr., all she knew was that she had asked Agalarov to arrange a meeting with him and that his son had helped arrange it.

She told the paper she wanted to inform the Trump campaign of allegations that an American firm Browder worked with — Ziff Brothers Investments — did not pay taxes in Russia and had donated to Democrats.

She said Trump Jr. wasn’t interested in the information. The article points out that Trump Jr. expressed disappointment on Fox News that the information boiled down to an American firm donating to the Democratic National Committee that didn’t pay Russian taxes.

“I was like, ‘What does this have to do with anything?’” Trump Jr. said.

Veselnitskaya expressed disappointment too: “My expectation before the meeting was he read my letter of information, he got interested, and he was going to help me. His expectations were totally different, as I can understand now.”

Browder himself suggested the meeting was part of the coordinated Russian government attempt to undermine him and the Magnitsky Act.

“They were on a major full-court press on all fronts with Congress, with the press … with Trump Jr.,” Browder said. “I think that she’s working hand in glove with Chaika, and it’s all part of a coordinated strategy back at headquarters.”

The feud between Russia and Browder started about a decade ago.

Browder, the U.S.-born manager of Hermitage Capital, a London-based hedge fund, hired Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky. Magnitsky accused Russian officials of defrauding his firm in Russia out of $230 million in a tax scheme.

Magnitsky was then arrested in 2008 by Russian authorities for allegedly helping Hermitage Capital underpay taxes and for masterminding the fraud he uncovered.

Browder was barred entry into Russia, and Magnitsky later died in prison in November 2009. Independent investigators said he died of torture and was denied medical treatment.

Browder lobbied for the successful 2012 passage of the Magnitsky Act, which sanctioned Russian officials who contributed to the death of Magnitsky. It was expanded in 2016 to include human rights abusers anywhere. The law allows the U.S. to add Russian human rights violators easily to a U.S. sanctions list, even if they had no part in the Magnitsky case.

Russia was angered by the passage of the law, banned American adoptions of Russian children in return, and has waged a public relations war against Browder. A Russian court has convicted Browder in absentia for tax evasion, and state-run Russian TV has aired investigations about him.

Veselnitskaya, as a private attorney, represented Denis Katsyv, the Russian owner of Prevezon Holdings, a Cyprus-based hotel and real-estate group, who was accused of violating the Magnitsky Act.

Katsyv was charged in the U.S. after investigators had suspected Prevezon used funds from the $230 million fraud scheme Magnitsky uncovered to buy New York real estate. Prevezon was charged by Preet Bharara, then-U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York and friend of former FBI Director James Comey.

That case brought Veselnitskaya to the U.S. in late 2015. As her visa was about to expire in September, the U.S. Attorney General’s office extended it through January. She was able to extend her stay again through June 2016, and during that time, she met with Trump Jr., Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), and attended a House hearing, among other activities in Washington.

The U.S. and Prevezon reached a $5.9 million civil settlement in April. Trump asked Bharara to leave in March, along with 46 other U.S. attorneys.

Browder has denied Veselnitskaya’s and the prosecutor general’s office’s accusations, calling them “stale and disproven,” and part of a well-resourced, Moscow-coordinated campaign to undermine him and the Magnitsky Act.

Browder filed a complaint with the Justice Department in July 2016 that accused Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin of violating U.S. lobbying laws by not registering their activities.

Browder is due to appear in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday for a hearing on enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act."
466,##########,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/4s_8nbzdsZE/,"NY Times, Washington Post Russia Conspiracy Stories Drop At Strategic Times",['Aaron Klein'],Breitbart,"TEL AVIV — The New York Times seems to be gloating that its reportage on Donald Trump Jr. and his brief meeting with a Russian lawyer is purportedly negatively impacting the “good feeling” inside the Trump administration following the U.S. president’s diplomatic trip to Europe for the Group of 20 summit last week.

The story marks the latest example of a leak or major news media claim about Trump and Russia dropping at strategic times while Trump was departing for or returning from a significant diplomatic venture.

The last section of the Times’ story on Trump Jr. and the lawyer, titled, “Trump Jr. Was Told in Email of Russian Effort to Aid Campaign,” seems to be gleeful about the manner in which the issue has overshadowed Trump’s G20 trip. It reads:

News of the meeting involving the younger Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Manafort blunted whatever good feeling the president’s team had after his trip to Europe for the Group of 20 economic summit meeting.

The president learned from his aides about the 2016 meeting at the end of the trip, according to a White House official. But some people in the White House had known for several days that it had occurred, because Mr. Kushner had revised his foreign contact disclosure document to include it.

The president was frustrated by the news of the meeting, according to a person close to him — less over the fact that it had happened, and more because it was yet another story about Russia that had swamped the news cycle.

The Times was referring to its exclusive story published on Saturday citing “confidential government records described to the New York Times” alleging that Trump Jr. arranged a meeting at Trump Tower two weeks after Trump secured the Republican nomination with a Russian lawyer who, the newspaper claimed, “has connections to the Kremlin.”

The Times subsequently published what it says are the contents of correspondence indicating that the meeting with the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was set up by third parties who claimed that Veselnitskaya had dirt on Hillary Clinton. It would not be abnormal for a political campaign to take a meeting with an individual claiming to have compromising information on an opponent.

“The woman, as she has said publicly, was not a government official,” Trump, Jr. said in a statement on Tuesday. “And as we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act. To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue. As Rob Goldstone said just today in the press, the entire meeting was ‘the most inane nonsense I ever heard. And I was actually agitated by it.’”

Trump Jr. subsequently released a chain of emails that show how the meeting was set up.

The Times’ story on the subject dropped as President Trump returned to the U.S. from the G20 Summit in Germany on Saturday night and the topic has since dominated the news cycle.

This is not the first such leak or major news media claim about Trump and Russia to be released while Trump was preparing for or returning from trips abroad.

On Tuesday, May 16, six days before Trump was due in Israel as part of his first trip abroad as president and while the White House was coordinating travel plans with Israel, the New York Times quoted a “current and a former American official” saying it was Israel that provided classified intelligence purportedly disclosed by Trump during a White House meeting one week prior with Russian officials.

There was immediate talk that the report could potentially impact the U.S. relationship with Israel. Indeed, the second sentence of the Times article on the subject stated that the information about Israel reportedly serving as the source “adds a potential diplomatic complication to the episode.”

The Times was elaborating on a Washington Post article one day earlier that first reported that Trump allegedly revealed “highly classified information” during a meeting with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador, according to “current and former U.S. officials.”

The Post article acknowledged that as president “Trump has broad authority to declassify government secrets, making it unlikely that his disclosures broke the law.”

Meanwhile, on May 19, the day Trump departed Washington, DC to Saudi Arabia for the first leg of his foreign tour, the Post reported that the Russia investigation “has identified a current White House official as a significant person of interest, showing that the probe is reaching into the highest levels of government, according to people familiar with the matter.”

The story further claimed the “senior White House adviser under scrutiny by investigators is someone close to the president, according to these people, who would not further identify the official.”

The article once again dominated the news cycle and drew attention away from Trump’s international diplomatic adventure amid a flurry of speculation that Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner may be the White House official in question.

Then on May 26, one day before Trump returned from his first international trip, the Washington Post dropped an anonymously sourced story claiming that Kushner discussed with Russia’s Washington envoy the possibility of establishing a “secret and secure communications channel” between Trump’s transition team and the Kremlin.

The Washington Post cited alleged communications from Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak to Moscow reportedly intercepted by U.S. intelligence officials. Russian diplomats are known to deliberately place misinformation in communications they believe are being monitored, the Post noted, allowing for the possibility that Kushner never actually asked for a back channel.

ABC News quoted two sources as saying the purported back channel that Kushner and Kislyak were allegedly discussing was supposed to focus on policy issues, including the war in Syria where Russia is highly influential. Fox News quoted a source saying it was the Russians – and not Kushner – who broached the concept of creating a secure line for back channel communications.

The establishment of back channels by incoming administrations is nothing new. Representatives for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign reportedly established a back channel with Iran.

Regardless, the Post’s original story, titled, “Russian ambassador told Moscow that Kushner wanted secret communications channel with Kremlin,” dominated the news cycle upon Trump’s return.

This instead of news media focus on Trump’s highly successful visit to Saudi Arabia, where he brought the Sunni Muslim leadership together to fight Islamic terrorism and oppose Iran; or his historic trip to Israel, which marked the first time a sitting U.S. president visited the Western Wall and the first time an American president went to the Jewish state on his first foreign tour. Trump also met with Pope Francis at the Vatican before attending a NATO summit in Brussels and a confab with G7 leaders in Sicily.

Lee Zeldin (R-NY) on Twitter Thursday after the congressman defended Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian attorney in a television interview.

In a series of Twitter posts, O’Donnell called Zeldin a “lying sack of sh*t” and a “moron” whose career is “over.”

“HEY REP LEE ZELDIN – SHUT UP – U SOUND LIKE A MORON – DEFENDING TRUMP – UR CAREER IS OVER,” O’Donnell wrote.

HEY REP LEE ZELDIN – SHUT UP – U SOUND LIKE A MORON – DEFENDING TRUMP – UR CAREER IS OVER @RepLeeZeldin — ROSIE (@Rosie) July 13, 2017

thats not the ""fact pattern"" – @RepLeeZeldin u r a lying sack of shit lee — ROSIE (@Rosie) July 13, 2017

shove ur fact pattern up ur ass @RepLeeZeldin — ROSIE (@Rosie) July 13, 2017

ok @KatyTurNBC – don't book assholes like lee — ROSIE (@Rosie) July 13, 2017

O’Donnell also tweeted to MSNBC host Katy Tur, requesting that she not invite “a**holes” like Zeldin on her program anymore.

A representative for Zeldin did not immediately return a request for comment. But the congressman sent a fundraising email to supporters Friday morning in which he blasted O’Donnell for her “character assassination” of him.

“It’s clear Rosie O’Donnell and her radical liberal supporters want to take Lee out and they’re even more desperate than ever to silence our voice,” the email read.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlCGY7ccAR0

Zeldin had appeared on Tur’s MSNBC show Thursday to defend Trump Jr.’s reported meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya in June, which sparked controversy and renewed allegations of collusion when it was reveled this week.

“There are investigations going on, and Don Jr. says he’s willing to testify,” Zeldin told Tur. “There’s been an open line of communication there over the course of these last few days indicating there is total cooperation there, and will play out.”

“I base my own independent judgement off of the information that I have,” he added. “And everything that everyone knows about what happened at that meeting was that absolutely none of that hypothetical that was just presented actually took place. So I’m not going to assume a different fact pattern than what we’ve come into contact with. And as these investigations are playing out, if there’s additional information, then we take that into account in being able to answer the question differently.”

O’Donnell has been a consistent and outspoken opponent of both the president and his sons since well before the 2016 election. The comedian previously called for martial law to delay Trump’s inauguration, and just this week backed up former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in his social media scuffle with Trump.

The program, which aired on Wednesday from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. ET, spent 93 percent of the show discussing Donald Trump Jr’s decision to release a series of private emails from June 2016, exchanged before he met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who promised him damaging information on Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

However, the promise did not materialize, with Trump Jr. describing the meeting “opposition research.” His released email chain does not refer to any cooperation, coordination, or collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

A further 5.5 percent of the New Day broadcast was spent providing negative coverage of the GOP’s healthcare bill, and 1.5 percent on news relating to baseball, the report found.

Meanwhile, a Harvard study released in May found that 93 percent of CNN’s coverage within the Trump administration’s first 100 days was critical of the new president, concluding that it “set a new standard for negativity.”

“Trump has received unsparing coverage for most weeks of his presidency, without a single major topic where Trump’s coverage, on balance, was more positive than negative, setting a new standard for unfavorable press coverage of a president,” the authors of the study wrote.

The network, which President Donald Trump has described as “fake news” and the “enemy of the American people,” has upped its anti-Trump rhetoric in recent weeks amid a fake news scandal in which three CNN employees resigned after the network was forced to retract a hit piece on President Donald Trump and his associates.

( h/t GWP ) At the heart of the current media Russian narrative du jour is a story about Donald Trump Jr. meeting with a Russian attorney named Natalia Veselnitskaya. That meeting took place on June 9th 2016 in Trump Tower.

Now it is discovered via video and images, that only 5 days later, June 14th 2016, Ms. Veselnitskaya was a guest of former Obama administration Russian Ambassador Michael McFaul in Washington DC for a House of Representatives hearing on U.S. Policy Toward Putin’s Russia. [Video HERE – and Video HERE]

Ms. Natalia Veselnitskaya is pictured seated in the front row directly behind former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Mr. Michael McFaul at the House Foreign Affairs Committee. This is June 14th, 2016, five days after the reported meeting with Donald Trump Jr.

Link to Ambassador McFaul’s testimony (confirming date) is HERE

It should be noted that Ambassador McFaul was very publicly discussing the ‘Muh Russia’ conspiracy narrative in the media and appeared on numerous NBC and MSNBC broadcasts during the 2016 campaign, and immediately after the election.

Additionally, it was Michael McFaul who was the architect of the Obama/Clinton “Russian Reset”, that eventually led McFaul to becoming the Ambassador to Russia (NYT Link).

Ambassador Michael McFaul immediately caused quite a bit of controversy while in Russia as he indulged with various anti-Putin operatives.

Michael McFaul, the U.S. ambassador in Moscow from 2012-2014, was accused by Russian state television of seeking to orchestrate the overthrow of President Vladimir Putin after hosting opposition activists and Kremlin critics at the embassy in his second day on the job. (Politico Link)

Another example of McFaul’s in-your-face antagonism is HERE.

On the heels of the 2011 WikiLeaks State Department Cables release (example below) Ambassador McFaul was kicked out of Russia:

(C) On January 14, National Security Council Senior Director for Russia Michael McFaul met with Boris Nemtsov and Vladimir Milov of the Solidarity Movement, Grigoriy Bovt of the political party Right Cause, and Vladimir Ryzhkov, former head of the now defunct Russia’s Republican Party and professor at Moscow’s Higher School of Economics. All four leaders view Barack Obama as a highly pragmatic president focused on external cooperation with Russia, but supposedly not willing to pressure the Russian government for greater political freedom. President Medvedev is not seen as a viable alternative to Prime Minister Putin, who they believe will likely retake the Presidency in 2012. This, according to them, will ensure that a corrupt and unresponsive government continues to run Russia. They agreed that the aim of the political opposition over the next two years should be to prevent the return of Putin to the presidency. According to them, however, given Putin’s control over society only an emergency situation could bring about his fall from grace. […] McFaul opined that “de-Putinization” must come from within Russia, from a focus on civil education to broaden demands within society for increased freedom. Though the President may not be as vocal about his support for civil society within Russia as opposition members in Russia might prefer, McFaul made clear to this group, all of whom he has known throughout his career, that the President fully supports democratic reform in Russia. All agreed that dramatic change in the Russian political landscape would not take place in the near future. 5. National Security Council Senior Director for Russia Michael McFaul has cleared on this cable. (WikiLeaks Cable Link)

It should also be noted that Ambassador McFaul’s friend, Ms. Natalia Veselnitskaya, was initially denied an entry visa into the United States in 2016 and appealed her situation to the U.S. District Court of New York. She was granted a parole letter allowing her to enter the United States on behalf of a client.

Here’s her filing to the U.S. District Court in New York.

Natalia Veselnitskaya was/is also a very vocal anti-Trump person on all of her social media accounts – SEE FACEBOOK ARCHIVE HERE – So why would someone with a disposition of being anti-Trump want to deliver information to Donald Trump Jr? …Especially considering Ms. Veselnitskaya was never identified within the original email request for a meeting? ….and Donald Trump Jr. said, correctly it appears, that he had no idea whom he would be meeting with(?) .

It’s enough to make you wonder what exactly is the nature of the relationship between Natalia Veselnitskaya and President Obama’s appointees such that they would be visibly working together only a few days after her reported meeting with Donald Trump Jr. in Trump Tower….

Curiouser and Curiousor…

As Jeans2nd aptly notes: Natalia Veselnitskaya could have known Michael McFaul going all the way back to 2008 when McFaul was in Russia as an Obama campaign advisor.

(Via Daily Caller) […] Anatoli Samochornov, a Russia-born professional translator who worked as a part-time contractor for the State Department, worked with Veselnitskaya last year on an effort to roll back the Magnitsky Act, a law passed in 2012 which allows for sanctions against Russians accused of human rights abuses. (link)

As each day passes, and as more information is revealed, it looks increasingly likely the entire meeting on June 9th was being guided by purposeful construction. Our early research into the motives behind the players involved appears to have been accurate.

Of course all oppositional entities who are antagonistic toward the president shout “conspiracy theory”. However, the political motives are almost identical in construct to the 17 sexual harassment Trump accusers that mysteriously disappeared shortly after the election.

Having followed the deep weeds of politics for quite a while, here’s the most likely scenario.

Professional democrats are notorious for their creation of false outrage within political campaigns. Mitt Romney’s binders of women, and 47% controversy are merely examples of nothingburgers thrown up against a politician not skilled enough to push back against the false narratives.

It is becoming increasingly clear that as soon as the Democrats saw Donald Trump was most likely going to win the GOP nomination (May 2016), they assembled their opposition research crews to build-out the best scandals for use in the general election.

The Russian Conspiracy scandal was one of the approaches; the ‘sexual harassment’ scandal was another. Two ongoing attack angles both of which could be deployed depending on the consulting poll test results.

Not surprisingly the Clinton Team, which includes the Clinton media as revealed by WikiLeaks, decided to go with the “sexist”/”sexual harassment” angle. It didn’t work.

It didn’t work, but they still had the “Russian’s support Trump” angle at the ready; so it was only a matter of a few phone calls to expand the narrative and put the wheels in motion to undermine, marginalize and disrupt…

If Team Clinton, writ large, had originally chosen the Russian angle for the general election it too would have failed. AND we would currently be bombarded with the sexual harassment accusations etc. Both narratives were/are essentially interchangeable because ultimately the objectives of both were/are the same.

Rob Goldstone is a music producer who represents a Russian pop star named Emin Agalarov. Emin Agalarov’s father was a business contact who coordinated bringing the Miss Universe pageant to Russia in 2013. Goldstone contacted Donald Trump Jr. to set up a meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya. The email chain is below:

The New York Times is unhappy with the release, as they were planning to write a story about it.

[Transcript] 2:28 P.M. EDT – MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. Before we get started, I’d like to bring up Marc Short, the Director of Legislative Affairs, to give an update on how we’re moving the President’s agenda through Congress, particularly on the historic obstruction from Senate Democrats on confirming the President’s incredibly qualified nominees to posts across the federal government.

After his statement, Marc will take a few of your questions on that topic; and after that, I will be back to answer your other questions.

Thanks. Marc.

MR. SHORT: Good afternoon. This week, the Senate has scheduled a few confirmation votes. Yet as even The Washington Post has reported, the Senate is conducting the slowest confirmation process in American history. For the past six months, Senator Schumer has deliberately run an unprecedented campaign of obstruction against the President’s nominees for high-ranking positions in the government.

Not only are key national security, energy, financial, and regulatory positions left unfilled, procedural slowdowns have kept the Senate committees from doing other legislative work.

Democrats even walked out of committee hearings to deny a quorum, like school children taking their toys from the playground. But it’s the American people who are being hurt. These obstruction tactics are carried out in the name of resisting the Trump administration and playing to a radical left-wing base. But it’s the will of the American people that is being denied.

As war rages in the Middle East, the Senate hasn’t confirmed many national security appointees. In fact, the President’s nominee for Under Secretary of Defense, Elaine McCusker, enjoyed bipartisan support as she advanced through committee. But she has now been waiting since May 23rd for a vote on the Senate floor.

The person responsible for ensuring our national security throughout all foreign investments is still waiting an up or down vote. Heath Tarbert was voted out of committee on May 23rd and for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has now waited for over a month for a confirmation vote.

As Americans are anxious to get back to work and get the economy growing again after eight years of stagflation — sorry, stagnation, the nominee to run the President’s Council of Economic Advisers is stuck waiting for approval. Kevin Hassett again received Democrat support and an endorsement letter from 44 bipartisan economists, some of whom even served in the Obama administration. He was approved in committee on June 14th and again is still waiting to be confirmed.

The list goes on. We currently have seven deputy secretaries — to manage entire federal departments — who have been cleared by committee and are waiting for a vote on the Senate floor.

Folks, it’s July 10th, and we do not have deputy secretaries at the Small Business Administration, the Department of Interior, the Department of Energy, HUD, HHS, OMB, and the Department of Defense. Senate committees have cleared 32 of our nominees who are still waiting for a floor vote.

In total, there are 133 nominees waiting for consideration by various committees. While Senator Schumer irresponsibly champions the resist movement, his partisan tactics are harming the country and obstructing the will of the American people.

To date, the Senate has confirmed a total of 50 Trump administration nominees. To put that in perspective, the Senate had confirmed 202 officials at this same point in the Obama administration. We think that that is a fair analogy because Republicans now control the Senate. Democrats controlled the Senate at that point. And the comparison is 50 to 202.

By the August recess in 2009, the Senate had confirmed 292 Obama administration nominees by voice vote alone. To date, the Trump administration nominees have received five voice vote confirmations.

The truth is the Democrats are putting their agenda ahead of the will of the American people. Democrats are keeping key agency nominees from serving their country. And today, we’re calling on Senator Chuck Schumer to stop blocking the will of the American people for political gain. And we’re also calling on you in the media to help shine light to bring this problem to light of day.

The Senate will likely devote this entire week to approving just three well-qualified nominees. We ask: Give these critical nominees an up or down vote so they can get to work.

I’m happy to take your questions.

♦ Q Have you talked to the Democrats at all to find out why they’re offering such pushback? And have you tried to negotiate with them behind the scenes to try and cure some of the problem? Or is it just here that we’ve heard about it?

MR. SHORT: Yes, we have spoken to them. Yes, we’ve been trying to work that. I think that one comment that Democrats are likely to say is that, well, Republicans control the committees, and so they could move forward these committee assignments to the House floor quicker. But as we’ve already articulated to you, 32 of our nominees are sitting there waiting for floor votes now. The number of voice votes is small — a fraction of what was afforded Obama nominees. And we think that there’s really no historical precedent for this.

♦ Q Just one quick follow-up then. What about those Democrats who are also saying this pales in comparison to what Senator McConnell said about the previous administration that goal one was to not pass anything that — or help the administration out in way, shape, or form?

MR. SHORT: I think that the record shows that what McConnell did as the Senate Republican leader at the time was to confirm Obama’s nominees. I think there’s a long history of believing the American people elect an administration. The committees determine the qualifications. And assuming that those candidates are qualified, they get votes. We’re not receiving that courtesy.

Yes, Peter.

♦ Q Marc, if can ask you, earlier today, we heard from some top U.S. senators, including Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, Patty Murray and others that basically said in simple terms they want to advance policies that would help bring stability to health insurance markets and make premiums more affordable for millions of Americans, effectively calling for bipartisanship in the effort to deal with healthcare right now. Do you think bipartisanship — given the fact about Democrats to work with Republicans on these nominees — is bipartisanship the way to go to best serve Americans on healthcare?

MR. SHORT: I think that we believe that bipartisanship is a solution to a lot of our problems. We have not seen bipartisanship. The numbers I’m giving you right now shows everything they’re trying to do is obstruct our agenda.

And specific to healthcare, we’ve commented several times that we would welcome bipartisan support. The Democrats who have said to us openly — they say, look, we know Obamacare is failing. We know that insurance markets are collapsing. We know that insurers are leaving them and that rates have in many cases doubled, and some cases tripled. But we can’t be a part of Obamacare repeal because that’s viewed as something that was a signature accomplishment of the previous administration.

So there may come a time for being able to partner with them. But I don’t think that happens till after this repeal.

Jon.

♦ Q So, Marc, how confident are you that you’ll be able to pass this Republican-only? Democrats — you can’t blame them for blocking you on this bill, this healthcare bill. How confident are you that you’ll get it done by August? And if it fails, are you going to bring the Democrats down here to work on more modest fixes to the current law?

MR. SHORT: We’re confident that it’s going to pass, and that we’re not going to be in a situation of failure, Jon.

But at the same time, I think that the President recognizes that Republicans have campaigned on repeal and replace since 2010. In all candor, in many ways, he was looking forward to the day he was inaugurated having a bill on his desk to repeal it because it’s something the Republicans have said they would be doing, again, since the 2010 election cycle.

So we’re anxious to get that bill and for the President to sign it.

♦ Q But if it doesn’t come here by the end of — by August, are you going to bring Democrats down here? Are we going to see —

MR. SHORT: We still look forward to completing the repeal and replace before August.

♦ Q Marc, Republican voters know that you have a majority in the Senate. You also have a 51-vote threshold. They also know the Senate Majority Leader controls the calendar, especially on executive branch nominations. So explain to them why it’s only a Democratic obstruction problem?

MR. SHORT: Well, as you understand the nature of cloture votes, it required — that is something that in past administrations has not been required. And so —

♦ Q Motion to proceed, in other words.

MR. SHORT: Yes, thank you, Major.

So in previous administrations — I know I have the number here — it was roughly about 5 percent of nominees that were required to get cloture votes. In our case, it’s been about 90 percent. So, yes, there is the process that the Republicans control the committees. In some cases I mentioned, they’ve gone to the extraordinary steps of actually walking out of committee hearings to deny a quorum, just delaying the process.

And in many cases, we believe that part of this is obstruction because they know the most precious thing the Senate has is floor time, so if they stretch this out longer, it means you don’t get to your legislative agenda. So it’s part of their strategy, as well.

But it is historic in the level of obstruction that is denying the will of the American people who elected a new administration and expect that administration to be able to staff the departments.

♦ Q Now, Marc, you told that you have confidence that healthcare will get passed by the August break. But it appears by all the reporting that we do that the trajectory is moving in the opposite direction. A greater number of Republicans are ambivalent or opposed to this currently drafted legislation than just two weeks ago. What is the source of your confidence when the outward vote counting appears to be moving in the opposite direction from the administration’s vantage point?

MR. SHORT: We look forward to being able to — we support bills that provide I think many things that the various factions of the party were looking for.

I think what you heard over the recess was just expressing displeasure with the previous draft that’s now been amended. It includes, as you know, a lot of resources for opioid funding that many in states perhaps more in the Midwest that have been plagued by opioid addiction were looking to get. It also includes the ability to use your HSA accounts to pay for premiums, and that’s something that many of the conservatives have asked for.

We also are waiting to see how the Cruz-Lee amendment gets scored. So we believe that the bill is changing significantly in a way that will garner the necessary votes.

♦ Q Marc, thank you. Can you map out specifically what role President Trump is going to take in trying to get this bill over the finish line? Obviously in the final days of the healthcare bill’s passage, he was very front and center. Is he going to take the same type of approach in these next two weeks? Obviously he has the Paris trip coming up.

And then I know you’re focused on plan A. But should you need a plan B as the position of this White House that Obamacare should be repealed with a plan to replace it further down the line?

MR. SHORT: Several questions there. I think that there’s a natural difference between a bill passed in the House and a bill passed in the Senate. And so when you have 435 members in the House, I do think that the appearance will be more frenetic. You’ll see many members coming over here to the White House for broader meetings.

In the Senate, we know that the number of targeted votes is a much smaller number. And so you’re not going to see that same level of activity, of members coming and outside the White House. But that doesn’t mean the President isn’t engaged.

As the President was leaving for his most recent trip on a holiday weekend, he was continuing to make calls. And he’ll continue to make this case. This is a promise that Republicans have made to voters, and it’s a promise that he expects them to deliver on.

♦ Q Does he need the plan B option? Is it still the position of this White House, as the President tweeted several days ago, that the focus should shift to repealing Obamacare now, making sure that happens, that promise to America’s voters —

MR. SHORT: To be clear, we still believe that the bill before the United States Senate is the preferable path. I just want to state that clearly for everybody, that that is the path that we’re planning on.

But I think the President is making a very clear point that Republicans have voted many times on a repeal bill. And when we talk about its repealing, it’s important to keep in mind what that did. It continued payment for Medicaid. It continued — it would create basically a stabilization fund to keep the markets as they are for a period of two, three years until a replacement plan is put together.

And I think the President is making the case that Republicans have already cast that vote. And it’s not as if markets have gotten healthier. Markets have only continued to become — have continued to collapse.

And so in light of that, it’s pretty hard to explain we think how you would have voted for it 18 months ago and couldn’t support the similar vote when the markets get worse than what they were.

So the President does recognize that he just thinks stating a simple political fact, that that’s a vote they’re on record. In fact, 49 of the current Republicans voted for that previously. In addition now, Todd Young voted for it in the House, and is in Senate. So right there you have 50 votes basically casting the same vote.

♦ Q — you’re referring to, right, Marc?

MR. SHORT: There’s been multiple repeals. This — was December 15th.

♦ Q Back on the obstruction charge, has the President raised this directly with Senator Schumer? And how often do they communicate?

MR. SHORT: I will leave the President’s personal conversations with Senator Schumer. But keep in mind, that there are also Democrat nominees working through this process; that there are certain independent boards and agencies for which statutorily the Democrats, the minority party gets its own picks.

And to date, I will grant you it’s a very small sample size, but we have nominated twice as many to this point as Bush had — sorry, as McConnell had of Republicans. So it’s again, one more factor of us looking to try to be bipartisan and help to make the nominations that they’re asking for. Yet there’s been no reciprocation as far as a courtesy and anything but obstruction.

♦ Q Back on healthcare issue, how much confidence does the President have in Senator McConnell to push this over the line?

MR. SHORT: The President has confidence in both Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell.

♦ Q Marc, slightly off topic. There’s a quote floating around of you saying that you think the Iran — the drafted legislation on the Iran and Russia sanctions is poorly written. And so I want to know is the White House going to support a bill that is not poorly written? And what exactly would you like to see changed for the White House to support it?

MR. SHORT: Thanks. To be clear, the administration’s perspective is, is that we support the sanctions in the bill on Russia and Iran. Keep in mind, it’s initially an Iran bill for which there is a Russia sanctions amendment. The administration is fully supportive of those sanctions.

What our concern is, is that the legislation we believe sets an unusual precedent of delegating foreign policy to 535 members of Congress by not including certain national security waivers that have always been consistently part of sanctions bills in the past. And so by stripping that, what you in essence do is create I think challenge for us diplomatically and in many cases the ability to react quickly to ongoing circumstances where if a nation is cooperating with you, you can extend waivers. Or there’s certain examples where there’s covert activities in which it’s helpful to have that ability. And by stripping that away from the executive branch, we think the way it’s currently drafted is something that neither a Democrat nor a Republican administration could support.

♦ Q Did the subject come up in the meetings with President Putin at all? Anything around that?

MR. SHORT: That I’m aware of.

♦ Q Marc, on healthcare, one of the reasons that so many senators are reluctant to endorse this bill right now is they’re hearing a lot of opposition in their districts. They’re hearing phone calls in their offices. Is there anything that the President is going to do to use his bully pulpit to make an affirmative case for the American people for this bill? We’ve not heard him do that so far, apart from a few tweets here and there.

MR. SHORT: I think the President has made an affirmative case for the bill, but I think your larger point is a fair one — that the left I think has been more organized in their messaging on this than collectively Republicans have as far as advocating for the benefits of the bill. And I fully accept that point as sort of a lesson learned moving forward.

♦ Q Well, can the President do anything?

MR. SHORT: I think that he will continue —

♦ Q If he could do an address to the American people?

MR. SHORT: The President you will — again, I believe the President has remained very active in this debate, and you will see him continue to remain so. And as far as what plans he has for travel that maybe he could go to targeted states to make his case, I think we’ll wait and see.

♦ Q Marc, do you think it was the right idea, the right approach to have a more of a hands-off approach during this Senate process than he did during the House process? I know Senator McConnell asked the White House to be not directly involved in the negotiations. As it sits here right now, do you believe that that was the right approach? And what are you doing specifically this week to get the Jerry Morans and the Senator Hoevens on board? Because opioids aren’t their concern.

MR. SHORT: I reject the premise of your question. I believe that the administration has been involved. I think initially after the House bill passed, there needed to be a time of rescoring the bill. And that’s what’s transpired in which everyone was a little bit on the sideline.

But since then I think that the Vice President has been to the Senate Policy Lunch every week in which this has been the primary focus of conversation. Seema Verma from HHS has gone and had countless meetings with members who are questioning where they stand or are undecided. She’s been talking to them very specifically about Medicaid funding for their states in very formulaic conversations. The Secretary of HHS, Tom Price, has been making calls and meeting with members throughout the holiday, as well.

So again, it’s different because when you have 435 members in the House, you’re going to see a lot more activity coming in and out of this building. But I think that that’s a false measure for the level of activity that we have in this debate.

♦ Q How do you explain the approval rating for this bill as it now sits? It’s so much lower than the President’s approval rating. Shouldn’t it be at least as high, in the 30s or 40 or something? Why is it so low?

MR. SHORT: I think back to Phil’s question. I think that it’s a fair point that the Democrats were more organized in their messaging on the bill than collectively Republicans have been in making their case for the benefits of it.

But I also continue to see polling that suggests that the American people do want Obamacare repealed. The number of people —

♦ Q They don’t like this bill, though.

MR. SHORT: The number of people who have lost insurance, they know that it’s a dramatic problem. And I think that there’s more we could be doing in educating the benefits of repealing and replacing with our plan.

♦ Q Marc, thank you. Part of the case you’re making for this bill is that the exchanges are collapsing. And day after day Sarah and Sean stand at that podium and talk about insurance —

MR. SHORT: God bless them.

♦ Q Yes, sir. Insurance companies that are pulling out of the exchanges. But until that bill passes, Obamacare is the law of the land. And those exchanges are set up by the law. Has the administration made — or is the administration making any effort to keep these insurance companies in the exchanges? Or are you guys just letting them pull out? What sort of effort is there to keep them in?

MR. SHORT: It’s a great question. I guess fundamentally we don’t think it’s the federal government’s job to force and insurer to stay in the exchange. In fact, I think today what you’re going to see from a report coming out this afternoon from CMS is that for the 2016 year, 281 insurers were in the private Obamacare exchanges. By 2017, it had fallen to 241. And just now — as they’re supposed to submit their bids for next year in 2018, it’s down to 140 insurers. Half of the insurers have already fled the markets. I don’t think they’re going to give you much more evidence that this system is failing.

♦ Q Just to be clear, there’s been no outreach or effort on the administration’s part to attempt to keep any of these companies in the exchanges?

MR. SHORT: We continue to talk to insurers at the HHS and OMB level to continue to talk about here are things that we can do from a regulatory impact to make it easier for you. So, yes, that is happening.

But again, I think that we fundamentally take a different view of the way the government should work. It’s not a heavy handed enforcement to say you must say in the exchanges. That’s not the way we do it. The previous administration may have.

♦ Q As you’re talking about the healthcare bill changing, is the President listening to the diverse voices like women’s groups, people from Appalachia who didn’t like Obamacare but like the benefits of ACA? Is he listening to those diverse voices to be able to change it to benefit all America? Or is it just also his base he’s focusing more on? Or is it all America?

MR. SHORT: No, I think — I appreciate the question. But I think the President recognizes he’s the President of all the American people, and he wants a healthcare plan that meets all their needs. He’s not looking to target a plan that just benefits his base.

And so I think that he is — there have been many countless listening sessions the President has hosted here in the White House with different groups, some that have been open to the media, some that have not. But he’s heard from a wide group of people and believes that this is the best plan forward.

♦ Q Tax reform update for us?

MR. SHORT: Tax reform update — we are continuing to have conversations. I’m actually leaving here to head to the Hill momentarily, continuing to have conversations with them on our schedule. We hope to have a plan that we’re agreed upon between the House, Senate, and the White House.

I think we’ve been very intentional about wanting to be on the same page and not have multiple plans, and so —

♦ Q Maybe something this week?

MR. SHORT: The schedule — I would doubt it would be this week. I think that hopefully before the August recess is when we have it locked in place, and that we would look to begin the markup process when we return from August recess.

♦ Q Can you lower the corporate rate, though, to a level that is more competitive internationally? That seemed to be a big focus.

MR. SHORT: Absolutely, we can lower the corporate rate and absolutely the President is focused 100 percent on getting growth back in our economy.

♦ Q Marc, one thing, Senator Sasse has said that if by today the Senate hadn’t made meaningful progress in coming together around a single bill, they should move ahead with repeal, followed by discussing replace afterward. And the President appeared to endorse that right before — so be clear, do you think that they’ve made enough progress at this point that they don’t need to go down that?

MR. SHORT: Look, I think if that’s a deadline that Senator Sasse set, you should ask Senator Sasse that. I don’t think the President set our official deadline on that. As we’ve already discussed in a previous question, I think that he’s just pointing out the obvious of where the votes are in a previous repeal vote. Thank you.

♦ Q Nominations. I hope you’ll find it an important question. You describe this as a national security threat, the fact that there are 16 nominees on the defense side that have not been confirmed. Given that, given the Democrats’ strategy, would it be a mistake if the Senate were to go on recess in August if these nominees are not confirmed?

MR. SHORT: I think that we are looking toward confirmations by the August recess. One of the data points I gave you is a comparison of what Obama had confirmed by August recess, and that’s a threshold that we’ll look at.

And I think that the President has every right to call Congress back if necessary I think —

♦ Q Will he exercise that authority?

MR. SHORT: Because I think you make a very fair point that I believe that the Democrat obstruction is jeopardizing national security.

Thank you.

MS. SANDERS: Thanks, Mark.

Before we talk about all of the things coming up this week, I wanted to quickly give you guys a recap of the President’s trip to Poland and Germany last week and some of the things that happened back here at home while we were gone.

In both Germany and Poland, the President sought to reinforce old alliances and build new relationships, just as he promised he would do in his Inaugural Address to serve the interests of the American people.

In Poland, President Trump gave a powerful and historic speech in Warsaw that was widely praised both in Poland and the United States as one of the most important speeches by an American President on foreign soil in decades.

In his speech, the President saluted the spirit of the Polish people over centuries of hardship, and especially the Polish heroes of the Warsaw Uprising and those in the struggle to defeat communism.

The President reaffirmed that the NATO Alliance of free, sovereign, and strong independent nations is in the best interests of America and the security of the American people. He also reaffirmed America’s commitment to Article 5 of the NATO treaty and called upon member states to honor their full and fair financial obligations.

But even more importantly, the Warsaw Speech was a stirring defense of the West in a manner not heard from an American President in many years. Using the Polish experience as an example, President Trump reminded us of the shared history, culture, and values that have made Western civilization great and urged the nations of the West to defend it from new threats inside and out.

President Trump concluded by challenging the nations of the West to remember our histories, have confidence in our values, and have pride in who we are. He proclaimed that by remembering these strengths, we will continue to be the greatest, freest, most successful community of nations in history.

In Germany, the President successfully achieved his objectives on behalf of the American people at the G20.

In his discussions with more than a dozen foreign leaders, he underscored the need for nations to join together to strip terrorists of their funding, territory and ideological support — and to stop doing business with nations that sponsor terrorism, especially Iran.

On North Korea, he called on all nations to isolate the regime and to cut off all ties of trade and commerce.

At the same time, he hailed the launch of the World Bank’s Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, of which the United States is a founding member, to help empower women all across the world.

In his meetings, President Trump also underscored the need to end unfair trade practices and to finally provide American workers and businesses with a level playing field.

The trip to Poland and participation in the G20 summit have given the President tremendous cause for hope. He returned to the United States with great optimism for the future and incredible excitement for what lies ahead.

On Friday, while the President was participating in those important discussions at the G20, the June jobs report came out back here at home. Sadly there wasn’t a lot of coverage of these numbers, so I wanted to give you a few highlights: There were –222,000 new jobs were added in June, higher than the monthly average over the past year and well above expectations. With 187,000 private sector jobs added in June, there have now been over 800,000 private sector jobs added since the President took office.

And on top of all that, the jobs report from April and May were revised upward reflecting that an additional 47,000 jobs were added in those months than previously reported.

Looking ahead, as Marc told you, congressional Democrats are committed to inaction. Republicans are driving a lot of action on the Hill this week. Both houses are taking up important legislation on defense spending, military construction, and veterans affairs spending. And of course, the Senate is continuing to work on the Republican plan to repeal and replace the collapsing Obamacare system before it completely falls apart.

Just today, the Gallup-Sharecare survey showed that nearly 2 million adults in the United States dropped out of healthcare coverage this year. That’s 2 million more Americans who are being completely failed by the last administration’s broken promises; 2 million more Americans who deserve better, and they’re only a small part of the picture of those families and individuals who are suffering under the current system.

For those 2 million Americans and the countless others we hear about each time another insurer pulls out of a state’s exchange or one of the dwindling number of co-ops fails, it’s critical that the Senate moves swiftly and decisively to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a system that truly supports everyone to get the healthcare coverage they need.

Later this week, of course, the President will be in France, and we will have more details on that trip in the coming days. While the President is in France, the Vice President will deliver the opening keynote address to the National Governors Association’s Summer Meeting on Friday. And as a former governor, the Vice President will speak with some of his former colleagues about the President’s commitment to partnering with the states on issues like infrastructure, healthcare, and education. While in Rhode Island for the event, he will also meet with the Prime Minister of Canada, who is attending the NGA meeting to continue our country’s productive conversations on immigration, security, and trade — including renegotiating NAFTA.

Before I take your questions, I want to read a statement from the President on some recent current events.

Today, Iraqi Security Forces supported by the United States in the global coalition, liberated the city of Mosul from its longtime nightmare under the rule of ISIS. We congratulate Prime Minister Abadi, the Iraqi Security Forces, and all the Iraqis for their victory over terrorists who are the enemies of all civilized people. We mourn the thousands of Iraqis brutally killed by ISIS and the millions of Iraqis who suffered at the hands of ISIS. We grieve with the Iraqi people for the loss of heroic soldiers who gave their lives to restore life to their country, and we honor their sacrifice.

We in the United States and the global coalition are proud to stand with the Iraqi Security Forces and all those who made this moment of liberation possible. We’ve made tremendous progress against ISIS more in the past six months than the years since ISIS became a major threat. The victory in Mosul, a city where ISIS once proclaimed its so-called caliphate, signals that its days in Iraq and Syria are numbered. We will continue to seek the total destruction of ISIS.

And with that, I’ll take your questions. And, because he’s not always here and he’s a fellow Arkansan, Frank Lockwood.

♦ Q Thank you.

MS. SANDERS: Because I get to pick. (Laughter.)

♦ Q The President, today, tweeted that it would be unimaginable — he can’t imagine that Congress would go home from Washington in August, take the month off — if they haven’t dealt with the repeal and replace of Obamacare. If Congress does the unimaginable and goes for a month, is the President prepared to ensure that there are consequences for those vacationing lawmakers in 2018?

MS. SANDERS: I don’t know that he’s going to lay out a list of consequences. I think he’s focused on the positive component of this, and that’s the hope that all of the members of Congress will come together to repeal and replace Obamacare. That’s his focus — is making sure it gets done. Not on what happens if it doesn’t.

♦ Q If I could ask on one more tweet. The President also tweeted this morning about Hillary Clinton, Chelsea Clinton — said that she was giving away the country, I believe. At what point is the President going to put Hillary Clinton, Chelsea Clinton, Bill Clinton in the rearview mirror? He won the election. He won it fair and square. When does he just let them go and look forward?

MS. SANDERS: I believe this tweet was a response to the attacks on his daughter taking his seat, if I’m correct. Is that the one you’re referring to, Frank?

♦ Q Yeah.

MS. SANDERS: Look, this wasn’t about putting them in the front. This was about responding to an outrageous attack against a White House senior advisor. And it’s pretty standard protocol that when the leader gets up, someone takes their seat — as Chancellor Merkel also pointed out and said that this was perfectly standard protocol.

In fact, I think that we should be proud to have Ivanka sitting in that seat, considering particularly the topic at hand was part of her portfolio. If she didn’t have the last name that she has, I think she would be constantly celebrated instead of constantly attacked, and I frankly think it’s a sad thing that they chose to go after her in that moment.

Jonathan.

♦ Q Sarah, first, just a quick clarification from the meeting with Putin in Germany: Did the President say that he accepted Putin’s denial of any involvement in election interference, as Putin said in his press conference? Have you had a chance to ask the President about that?

MS. SANDERS: The President was — multiple times asked Putin whether or not he was involved. It took up a great deal of the conversation that they had on the front end of their meeting, and the President heard Putin’s denial and also realized they had some very important topics they needed to cover — Ukraine, North Korea, Syria — and decided to move on from that point of the conversation and focus on those issues.

♦ Q But he didn’t accept that denial or did he?

MS. SANDERS: Look, he heard Putin’s denial and he knew that at the end of the day the important part was them being able to have that conversation, him to directly ask him. He heard his answer and he moved forward with places that they thought they could work together. The President has been clear from his statements back in January and even in his tweets over the last couple of days, his opinion on that matter.

♦ Q And the question I wanted to ask was the reports on this meeting that took place at Trump Tower last June with Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner. When did the President learn that that meeting had taken place?

MS. SANDERS: I believe in the last couple of days is my understanding.

♦ Q Is he concerned about that — that the top leadership of his campaign would take a meeting with a Russian lawyer promising to give negative information?

MS. SANDERS: No, I mean, I’ve been on several campaigns and people call offering information. As I know many of you receive similar calls of people offering information. Don Jr. took a very short meeting from which there was absolutely no follow-up. Frankly, I think something that may make sense is looking at the Democrat National Committee coordinated opposition research directly with the Ukrainian Embassy. This is not an accusation, that’s an on-the-record action that they took. So if you’re looking for an example of a campaign coordinating with a foreign country or a foreign source, look no further than the DNC who actually coordinated opposition research with the Ukrainian Embassy. And no one in this room to my knowledge really had a big problem with that.

The only thing I see inappropriate about the meeting was the people that leaked the information on the meeting after it was voluntarily disclosed. At this point, I’d also like to add, Donald Trump Jr. has made a statement on this, the President’s outside counsel has made a statement on it, and now I have as well and I’m not going to add anything further.

Phil.

♦ Q Just to follow up on that. If this sort of meeting is normal and standard practice in the campaign, do you know if there were any other meetings that either Donald Trump Jr. or other representatives of the Trump campaign had with other Russian officials or any other foreign agent to collect information about Hillary?

MS. SANDERS: I don’t know of any other meetings with Don Jr., but I also haven’t had an extensive conversation with him.

♦ Q Has anyone looked into whether there were any others?

MS. SANDERS: I’m not sure, Phil. I’ll have to check and get back to you.

Matthew.

♦ Q Thanks, Sarah. I have a quick question about this cyber taskforce with Russia. Yesterday the President tweeted about the cybersecurity unit being put together, and then then about 12 hours later said that it would never happen. What went down in those 12 hours that so drastically changed that situation?

MS. SANDERS: This was part of a discussion in that meeting and, look, we recognize that Russia is a cyber threat, but we also recognize the need to have conversations with our adversaries. And when our adversaries see strength like they did with the President in the meeting, they can look for other ways to work on shared interests and look for positive places where they can move the ball forward. Particularly on things like the ceasefire, and that became a greater focus and something the President chose to stay focused on — is that front.

Major.

♦ Q Sarah, just to clarify: That idea is dead?

MS. SANDERS: Look, I would say that discussions may still take place but that’s as far as it is right now.

♦ Q Okay. And I know you just said a minute ago you aren’t going to make any additional statement, but there’s a history and we have been asked by you and others at the podium to respect the statements you make there. So, there’s a long history of blanket denials, during the transition and during times of this administration about nobody within the campaign having any meetings under any circumstances at all with Russian officials. And now one was disclosed this weekend. The original characterization of that meeting was amended within 24 hours when new information was placed before Don Jr. How are we to take all of these blanket denials that occurred through the transition and now when it has been proven and recognized by the President’s attorney and Don Jr. that those blanket denials were not factual?

MS. SANDERS: I think the point is that we’ve tried to make every single time, today and then, and will continue to make in those statements is that there was simply no collusion that they keep trying to create that there was.

♦ Q But that’s a different question than was asked at the time and different than the statements were about. The questions originally, as you know and I know, were about contacts, and those were blanket denials. And then when the contacts became confirmed, then it was, well they were infrequent. Well now we have a whole pattern of lots of different meetings that have to be confirmed later. And those original questions were not about collusion, Sarah. They were just about contacts.

MS. SANDERS: They were originally about that. That’s the whole premise of what you’re asking the question is whether or not the campaign colluded with Russia. That’s the premise of the entire scope of your questioning, and the point we’ve tried to make over and over again and will continue to make is that there wasn’t. And beyond that, I really can’t offer you anything.

♦ Q Sarah, back to yesterday morning’s tweets. Can you tell us what it was or what is or what was going to be a cybersecurity unit and how this was going to work?

MS. SANDERS: I’m not sure there were specific details discussed. I think it was simply just a discussion on cybersecurity threats and potential options. Not necessarily a formal kind of structure in place.

Jon Decker.

♦ Q Thanks a lot, Sarah. After this two and a half hour meeting with President Putin that the President had in Germany, how would you describe the state of U.S. relations with Russia. Do you view Russia as a partner? Do you view them as an ally? Do you view them as an adversary?

MS. SANDERS: I would want to have further conversations with members of the Secretary of State, National Security Council, but I think we saw that there were places of shared interest that we can work together; specifically, things like the Syrian ceasefire, that we both can agree on in order to move forward in some places. I don’t think that’s going to be the case on everything, but there are certainly certain instances where we can work together with Russia to make every part of the world a little bit safer.

♦ Q And does the President trust President Putin?

MS. SANDERS: I haven’t asked him that question.

♦ Q Can you please ask him that question?

MS. SANDERS: Yeah.

♦ Q Thank you, Sarah. I have two questions. We know there was no note taker in the meeting, but did you make an audio recording of the meeting or did the Russians?

MS. SANDERS: Not that I’m aware of. I’d have to ask. I’m not sure.

♦ Q Can you ask?

And the second question is: Director Comey was under oath when he said that the memo that he gave to his friend did not include classified information, and the President tweeted this morning that he did leak classified information. Is he accusing Comey of perjury?

MS. SANDERS: I think there are a lot of questions out there and a lot of reports where it indicates that Director Comey may have leaked classified information. That certainly is a threat to the national security and violates policy.

♦ Q You believe he leaked classified information?

MS. SANDERS: I think it is something that should be investigated thoroughly.

♦ Q But the President stated flatly that he leaked classified information.

MS. SANDERS: He’s got a much higher clearance. He may know something I don’t.

April.

♦ Q Sarah, I want to go back to a couple of questions. When you talk about the issue of Don Jr., you talk and you said leaked. What do you think about the word whistleblower?

MS. SANDERS: I’m sorry?

♦ Q You’re trying to say people who gave that information were leakers. What about the issue of whistleblower? What do you see whistleblower versus leaker?

MS. SANDERS: I think this is a voluntary disclosure to include some of that information, and I think that it would be inappropriate for that to be shared outside of the scope of the people that should have that information.

John Gizzi.

♦ Q Sarah, I just have one more question. So on the issue of collusion, are you saying there’s no collusion when it comes to the overall arch of the campaign? But what about the individuals? What about individuals that could be suspects of collusion? Are you vouching just for everyone in total or individuals or what?

MS. SANDERS: I’m saying that the President’s campaign did not collude in any way.

♦ Q So then when we go to different people, what do you say about that? Don Jr.? Anyone — the names that are coming up.

MS. SANDERS: I would certainly say Don Jr. did not collude with anybody to influence the election.

♦ Q What about Flynn? What about Flynn?

MS. SANDERS: To my knowledge, he did not collude with anybody to influence the campaign. Again, I think I’ve been very clear, our position is that no one within the Trump campaign colluded in order to influence the election. I think the bottom line is that the Democrats had a weak candidate, and President Trump had a stronger message, and they’re constantly looking for ways to undermine the President and delegitimize his election victory.

John Gizzi.

♦ Q Thank you, Sarah. Two brief questions. When the President arrived for the G20 Summit, it was widely reported that the Putin regime was cracking down on the opposition candidate — Mr. Navalny at the time. This has been just the latest in a series of events in which human rights and dissent have been crushed in Russia. Was human rights raised at all by the President in his conversations with the Russian President?

MS. SANDERS: I’m not sure. I’ll have to ask, John, and get back to you on that.

♦ Q Alright. My other question is —

MS. SANDERS: I knew there was a second one coming.

♦ Q The President did talk privately with Chancellor Merkel, we know. Days before he arrived there, her party, the Christian Democratic Union, made a much publicized change in its platform and dropped its reference to the United States as a friend and changed that to important ally. Was this something that came up in their meeting and did the President ask why she did that?

MS. SANDERS: Again, I haven’t heard that that was specifically discussed, but I’ll be happy to ask and circle back with you.

Trey.

♦ Q Two quick questions for you. Did President Trump discuss sanctions with Russian President Putin at the G20 Summit?

MS. SANDERS: I do know that it was mentioned. Specifically, when you ask about sanctions I know there is a little bit of a question there, and there were sanctions specific to election meddling that I believe were discussed, but not beyond that.

♦ Q Did the President’s views on sanctions against the Russians change at all after his meeting with President Putin?

MS. SANDERS: Not that I’m aware of.

♦ Q Thank you, Sarah. This latest meeting with the Russian lawyer. We not have three instances where — including with Ambassador Kislyak and a head of the Russia bank — where Jared Kushner seems to have met with Russians and not disclosed it during his security clearance check. Is the White House at all concerned about that and do you think it raises any questions about Kushner’s confidence or honesty?

MS. SANDERS: I believe, actually, it was disclosed on his security clearance when it updated — yeah —

♦ Q His updated paperwork, not initially.

MS. SANDERS: Right. With all of his contacts from during the transition and prior to that, they were all included in the update, not the original.

♦ Q So I’m saying — his omission in the original of all these meetings with Russians, is there any concern about that?

MS. SANDERS: No, because it was just an incomplete form. All of his foreign contacts were listed in the updated version not in the original.

Sorry, Steve.

♦ Q One of the subjects President Macron wants to talk to the President about is the Paris climate accord. Is the President willing to negotiate his position on this?

MS. SANDERS: I certainly think he likes to keep all things on the negotiating table. At the end of the day, the President is very focused on making sure that he gets the best deal for the American people. He certainly wants to do things to protect the environment, as we have a history of doing in the United States. He’s going to continue that practice and continue to encourage it but also make sure that he’s making the deal that’s best for the American people.

Thanks so much, guys.

.

Mr. Kushner also released his statement as delivered to the committee.

STATEMENT OF JARED C. KUSHNER TO CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES – July 24, 2017

I am voluntarily providing this statement, submitting documents, and sitting for interviews in order to shed light on issues that have been raised about my role in the Trump for President Campaign and during the transition period.

I am not a person who has sought the spotlight. First in my business and now in public service, I have worked on achieving goals, and have left it to others to work on media and public perception. Because there has been a great deal of conjecture, speculation, and inaccurate information about me, I am grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight.

My Role in the Trump for President Campaign

Before joining the administration, I worked in the private sector, building and managing companies. My experience was in business, not politics, and it was not my initial intent to play a large role in my father-in-law’s campaign when he decided to run for President. However, as the campaign progressed, I was called on to assist with various tasks and aspects of the campaign, and took on more and more responsibility.

Over the course of the primaries and general election campaign, my role continued to evolve. I ultimately worked with the finance, scheduling, communications, speechwriting, polling, data and digital teams, as well as becoming a point of contact for foreign government officials.

All of these were tasks that I had never performed on a campaign previously. When I was faced with a new challenge, I would reach out to contacts, ask advice, find the right person to manage the specific challenge, and work with that person to develop and execute a plan of action. I was lucky to work with some incredibly talented people along the way, all of whom made significant contributions toward the campaign’s ultimate success. Our nimble culture allowed us to adjust to the ever-changing circumstances and make changes on the fly as the situation warranted. I share this information because these actions should be viewed through the lens of a fast-paced campaign with thousands of meetings and interactions, some of which were impactful and memorable and many of which were not.

It is also important to note that a campaign’s success starts with its message and its messenger. Donald Trump had the right vision for America and delivered his message perfectly. The results speak for themselves. Not only did President Trump defeat sixteen skilled and experienced primary opponents and win the presidency; he did so spending a fraction of what his opponent spent in the general election. He outworked his opponent and ran one of the best campaigns in history using both modern technology and traditional methods to bring his message to the American people.

Campaign Contacts with Foreign Persons

When it became apparent that my father-in-law was going to be the Republican nominee for President, as normally happens, a number of officials from foreign countries attempted to reach out to the campaign. My father-in-law asked me to be a point of contact with these foreign countries. These were not contacts that I initiated, but, over the course of the campaign, I had incoming contacts with people from approximately 15 countries.

To put these requests in context, I must have received thousands of calls, letters and emails from people looking to talk or meet on a variety of issues and topics, including hundreds from outside the United States. While I could not be responsive to everyone, I tried to be respectful of any foreign government contacts with whom it would be important to maintain an ongoing, productive working relationship were the candidate to prevail.

To that end, I called on a variety of people with deep experience, such as Dr. Henry Kissinger, for advice on policy for the candidate, which countries/representatives with which the campaign should engage, and what messaging would resonate. In addition, it was typical for me to receive 200 or more emails a day during the campaign. I did not have the time to read every one, especially long emails from unknown senders or email chains to which I was added at some later point in the exchange.

With respect to my contacts with Russia or Russian representatives during the campaign, there were hardly any. The first that I can recall was at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. in April 2016. This was when then candidate Trump was delivering a major foreign policy speech. Doing the event and speech had been my idea, and I oversaw its execution. I arrived at the hotel early to make sure all logistics were in order. After that, I stopped into the reception to thank the host of the event, Dimitri Simes, the publisher of the bi-monthly foreign policy magazine, The National Interest, who had done a great job putting everything together. Mr. Simes and his group had created the guest list and extended the invitations for the event. He introduced me to several guests, among them four ambassadors, including Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

With all the ambassadors, including Mr. Kislyak, we shook hands, exchanged brief pleasantries and I thanked them for attending the event and said I hoped they would like candidate Trump’s speech and his ideas for a fresh approach to America’s foreign policy. The ambassadors also expressed interest in creating a positive relationship should we win the election. Each exchange lasted less than a minute; some gave me their business cards and invited me to lunch at their embassies. I never took them up on any of these invitations and that was the extent of the interactions.

Reuters news service has reported that I had two calls with Ambassador Kislyak at some time between April and November of 2016. While I participated in thousands of calls during this period, I do not recall any such calls with the Russian Ambassador.

We have reviewed the phone records available to us and have not been able to identify any calls to any number we know to be associated with Ambassador Kislyak and I am highly skeptical these calls took place. A comprehensive review of my land line and cell phone records from the time does not reveal those calls. I had no ongoing relationship with the Ambassador before the election, and had limited knowledge about him then. In fact, on November 9, the day after the election, I could not even remember the name of the Russian Ambassador.

When the campaign received an email purporting to be an official note of congratulations from President Putin, I was asked how we could verify it was real. To do so I thought the best way would be to ask the only contact I recalled meeting from the Russian government, which was the Ambassador I had met months earlier, so I sent an email asking Mr. Simes, “What is the name of the Russian ambassador?” Through my lawyer, I have asked Reuters to provide the dates on which the calls supposedly occurred or the phone number at which I supposedly reached, or was reached by, Ambassador Kislyak. The journalist refused to provide any corroborating evidence that they occurred.

The only other Russian contact during the campaign is one I did not recall at all until I was reviewing documents and emails in response to congressional requests for information. In June 2016, my brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr. asked if I was free to stop by a meeting on June 9 at 3:00 p.m.

The campaign was headquartered in the same building as his office in Trump Tower, and it was common for each of us to swing by the other’s meetings when requested. He eventually sent me his own email changing the time of the meeting to 4:00 p.m. That email was on top of a long back and forth that I did not read at the time. As I did with most emails when I was working remotely, I quickly reviewed on my iPhone the relevant message that the meeting would occur at 4:00 PM at his office. Documents confirm my memory that this was calendared as “Meeting: Don Jr.| Jared Kushner.” No one else was mentioned.

I arrived at the meeting a little late. When I got there, the person who has since been identified as a Russian attorney was talking about the issue of a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children. I had no idea why that topic was being raised and quickly determined that my time was not well-spent at this meeting.

Reviewing emails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time and that, in looking for a polite way to leave and get back to my work, I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for ten or so minutes and wrote “Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting.” I had not met the attorney before the meeting nor spoken with her since. I thought nothing more of this short meeting until it came to my attention recently.

I did not read or recall this email exchange before it was shown to me by my lawyers when reviewing documents for submission to the committees. No part of the meeting I attended included anything about the campaign, there was no follow up to the meeting that I am aware of, I do not recall how many people were there (or their names), and I have no knowledge of any documents being offered or accepted. Finally, after seeing the email, I disclosed this meeting prior to it being reported in the press on a supplement to my security clearance form, even if that was not required as meeting the definitions of the form.

There was one more possible contact that I will note. On October 30, 2016, I received a random email from the screenname “Guccifer400.” This email, which I interpreted as a hoax, was an extortion attempt and threatened to reveal candidate Trump’s tax returns and demanded that we send him 52 bitcoins in exchange for not publishing that information. I brought the email to the attention of a U.S. Secret Service agent on the plane we were all travelling on and asked what he thought. He advised me to ignore it and not to reply ― which is what I did. The sender never contacted me again.

To the best of my recollection, these were the full extent of contacts I had during the campaign with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian government.

Transition Contacts with Foreign Persons

The transition period after the election was even more active than the campaign. Starting on election night, we began to receive an incredible volume of messages and invitations from well-wishers in the United States and abroad. Dozens of messages came from foreign officials seeking to set up foreign leader calls and create lines of communication and relationships with what would be the new administration. During this period, I recall having over fifty contacts with people from over fifteen countries. Two of those meetings were with Russians, neither of which I solicited.

On November 16, 2016, my assistant received a request for a meeting from the Russian Ambassador. As I mentioned before, previous to receiving this request, I could not even recall the Russian Ambassador’s name, and had to ask for the name of the individual I had seen at the Mayflower Hotel almost seven months earlier. In addition, far from being urgent, that meeting was not set up for two weeks ― on December 1.

The meeting occurred in Trump Tower, where we had our transition office, and lasted twenty- thirty minutes. Lt. General Michael Flynn (Ret.), who became the President’s National Security Advisor, also attended. During the meeting, after pleasantries were exchanged, as I had done in many of the meetings I had and would have with foreign officials, I stated our desire for a fresh start in relations.

Also, as I had done in other meetings with foreign officials, I asked Ambassador Kislyak if he would identify the best person (whether the Ambassador or someone else) with whom to have direct discussions and who had contact with his President. The fact that I was asking about ways to start a dialogue after Election Day should of course be viewed as strong evidence that I was not aware of one that existed before Election Day.

The Ambassador expressed similar sentiments about relations, and then said he especially wanted to address U.S. policy in Syria, and that he wanted to convey information from what he called his “generals.” He said he wanted to provide information that would help inform the new administration. He said the generals could not easily come to the U.S. to convey this information and he asked if there was a secure line in the transition office to conduct a conversation. General Flynn or I explained that there were no such lines.

I believed developing a thoughtful approach on Syria was a very high priority given the ongoing humanitarian crisis, and I asked if they had an existing communications channel at his embassy we could use where they would be comfortable transmitting the information they wanted to relay to General Flynn. The Ambassador said that would not be possible and so we all agreed that we would receive this information after the Inauguration.

Nothing else occurred. I did not suggest a “secret back channel.” I did not suggest an on-going secret form of communication for then or for when the administration took office. I did not raise the possibility of using the embassy or any other Russian facility for any purpose other than this one possible conversation in the transition period. We did not discuss sanctions.

Approximately a week later, on December 6, the Embassy asked if I could meet with the Ambassador on December 7. I declined. They then asked if I could meet on December 6; I declined again. They then asked when the earliest was that I could meet. I declined these requests because I was working on many other responsibilities for the transition. He asked if he could meet my assistant instead and, to avoid offending the Ambassador, I agreed. He did so on December 12.

My assistant reported that the Ambassador had requested that I meet with a person named Sergey Gorkov who he said was a banker and someone with a direct line to the Russian President who could give insight into how Putin was viewing the new administration and best ways to work together. I agreed to meet Mr. Gorkov because the Ambassador has been so insistent, said he had a direct relationship with the President, and because Mr. Gorkov was only in New York for a couple days. I made room on my schedule for the meeting that occurred the next day, on December 13.

The meeting with Mr. Gorkov lasted twenty to twenty-five minutes. He introduced himself and gave me two gifts ― one was a piece of art from Nvgorod, the village where my grandparents were from in Belarus, and the other was a bag of dirt from that same village. (Any notion that I tried to conceal this meeting or that I took it thinking it was in my capacity as a businessman is false. In fact, I gave my assistant these gifts to formally register them with the transition office). After that, he told me a little about his bank and made some statements about the Russian economy. He said that he was friendly with President Putin, expressed disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for a better relationship in the future. As I did at the meeting with Ambassador Kislyak, I expressed the same sentiments I had with other foreign officials I met. There were no specific policies discussed.

We had no discussion about the sanctions imposed by the Obama Administration. At no time was there any discussion about my companies, business transactions, real estate projects, loans, banking arrangements or any private business of any kind. At the end of the short meeting, we thanked each other and I went on to other meetings. I did not know or have any contact with Mr. Gorkov before that meeting, and I have had no reason to connect with him since.

To the best of my recollection, these were the only two contacts I had during the transition with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian government.

Disclosure of Contacts on My Security Clearance Form

There has been a good deal of misinformation reported about my SF-86 form. As my attorneys and I have previously explained, my SF-86 application was prematurely submitted due to a miscommunication and initially did not list any contacts (not just with Russians) with foreign government officials. Here are some facts about that form and the efforts I have made to supplement it.

In the week before the Inauguration, amid the scramble of finalizing the unwinding of my involvement from my company, moving my family to Washington, completing the paper work to divest assets and resign from my outside positions and complete my security and financial disclosure forms, people at my New York office were helping me find the information, organize it, review it and put it into the electronic form.

They sent an email to my assistant in Washington, communicating that the changes to one particular section were complete; my assistant interpreted that message as meaning that the entire form was completed. At that point, the form was a rough draft and still had many omissions including not listing any foreign government contacts and even omitted the address of my father-in-law (which was obviously well known). Because of this miscommunication, my assistant submitted the draft on January 18, 2017.

That evening, when we realized the form had been submitted prematurely, we informed the transition team that we needed to make changes and additions to the form. The very next day, January 19, 2017, we submitted supplemental information to the transition, which confirmed receipt and said they would immediately transmit it to the FBI. The supplement disclosed that I had “numerous contacts with foreign officials” and that we were going through my records to provide an accurate and complete list. I provided a list of those contacts in the normal course, before my background investigation interview and prior to any inquiries or media reports about my form.

It has been reported that my submission omitted only contacts with Russians. That is not the case. In the accidental early submission of the form, all foreign contacts were omitted. The supplemental information later disclosed over one hundred contacts from more than twenty countries that might be responsive to the questions on the form. These included meetings with individuals such as Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Israel’s Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, Mexico’s Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Luis Videgaray Caso and many more. All of these had been left off before.

Over the last six months, I have made every effort to provide the FBI with whatever information is needed to investigate my background. In addition, my attorneys have explained that the security clearance process is one in which supplements are expected and invited. The form itself instructs that, during the interview, the information in the document can be “update[d], clarif[ied], and explain[ed]” as part of the security clearance process. A good example is the June 9 meeting.

For reasons that should be clear from the explanation of that meeting I have provided, I did not remember the meeting and certainly did not remember it as one with anyone who had to be included on an SF-86. When documents reviewed for production in connection with committee requests reminded me that meeting had occurred, and because of the language in the email chain that I then read for the first time, I included that meeting on a supplement. I did so even though my attorneys were unable to conclude that the Russian lawyer was a representative of any foreign country and thus fell outside the scope of the form. This supplemental information was also provided voluntarily, well prior to any media inquiries, reporting or request for this information, and it was done soon after I was reminded of the meeting.

****

As I have said from the very first media inquiry, I am happy to share information with the investigating bodies. I have shown today that I am willing to do so and will continue to cooperate as I have nothing to hide. As I indicated, I know there has been a great deal of speculation and conjecture about my contacts with any officials or people from Russia.

I have disclosed these contacts and described them as fully as I can recall. The record and documents I am providing will show that I had perhaps four contacts with Russian representatives out of thousands during the campaign and transition, none of which were impactful in any way to the election or particularly memorable. I am very grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight. I also have tried to provide context for my role in the campaign, and I am proud of the candidate that we supported, of the campaign that we ran, and the victory that we achieved.

It has been my practice not to appear in the media or leak information in my own defense. I have tried to focus on the important work at hand and serve this President and this country to the best of my abilities. I hope that through my answers to questions, written statements and documents I have now been able to demonstrate the entirety of my limited contacts with Russian representatives during the campaign and transition.

I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government. I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector. I have tried to be fully transparent with regard to the filing of my SF-86 form, above and beyond what is required. Hopefully, this puts these matters to rest.
