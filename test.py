According to two officials who spoke anonymously with the New York Times, the incident involved possible sexual misconduct between Kavanaugh and the woman.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Member John N. Kennedy said on "Fox News Sunday" that the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings have devolved into an "intergalactic freakshow."\n\n"I\'m fairly confident that our Founding Fathers did not intend the process to work this way," the Louisiana Republican told Chris Wallace.\n\nKennedy said Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) "did the best he could" to keep order during hearings marred by Democrats "ignoring rules" and about 240 protests by the senator\'s count.\n\n"The only thing missing was the genitalia-shaped headgear," Kennedy said of protesters, referring to the pink hats donned by anti-Trump demonstrators during the women\'s marches.\n\nI joined @FoxNewsSunday to talk about the latest developments with Judge Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh is extremely qualified to serve on the #SCOTUS. He has an outstanding and extensive judicial record and a strong judicial philosophy. https://t.co/MBOgroR0Sf — John Kennedy (@SenJohnKennedy) September 16, 2018\n\nKennedy blasted Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) for holding onto an anonymous letter alleging misconduct by Kavanaugh in high school. He also said the situation is one where many of the facts of the case cannot be reviewed by the members of the committee.\n\n"Most Americans... are looking at this and they\'re thinking that Congress has hit rock bottom and started to dig," he said.\n\nWallace asked Kennedy about incidents during the hearing involving Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).\n\nSchiff: \'Bob Mueller Is the One Draining the Swamp\', Trump \'Terrified\' of Manafort\n\nPirro: To Dems Like Feinstein, \'You\'re Guilty Until Proven Innocent\'\n\nSen John Kennedy (R-LA) tells Chris that the Kavanaugh confirmation process so far has been an "intergalactic freak show."

It was later determined the documents had been approved for release in some manner.\n\n"I did willingly violate the chairs rules on the committee\'s confidentiality process," Booker said at the time.\n\n.@SenJohnKennedy on the handling of the letter with allegations against Kavanaugh: They’ve had this stuff for three months. If they were serious about it, they should’ve told us about it. #KavanaughConfirmationHearings pic.twitter.com/YBXImQPoeL — FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) September 16, 2018\n\nKennedy said he was chairing the hearing in the temporary absence of Grassley, and refused to cut off Booker despite at least one plea from a Republican.\n\nI thought he should just "let it rip," Kennedy said of Booker\'s statements.\n\nHe said that Booker and Harris, who asked about Kavanaugh\'s possible relationship with private Trump attorney Marc Kasowitz\' firm, want liberal activist judges who "rewrite the Constitution every other Thursday."\n\nWatch more above.\n\nHuckabee: Kerry Talking to Iranians \'Makes the Case\' for First-Ever Logan Act Conviction\n\n\'Pretty Scummy\': \'The Five\' Blasts NYT for Now-Corrected Story on Haley\'s $52K Curtains'

Professor Christine Blasey Ford alleged Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a party in Bethesda, Md. 36 years ago.\n\n"This story doesn\'t have anything to do with justice," Carlson said, adding that to Democrats, it\'s all "about abortion."\n\nThe larger lesson of the past 2 yrs is the left will not abide losing power, even temporarily.

Political power is personal power to them," he said.\n\nCarlson warned that if the Democrats are able to derail Kavanaugh\'s nomination over 36-year-old allegations that cannot be proven true or proven false, they may never place another judge on the Supreme Court because a high "precedent" will be set.\n\nWatch more above.\n\nMom of MS-13 Victim Killed at Vigil on Anniversary of Daughter\'s Murder\n\nProof of \'Corruption\' or a \'Flailing President\': The Five Reacts to Trump Declassifying FISA Docs'
