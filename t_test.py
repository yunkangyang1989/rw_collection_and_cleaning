According to two officials who spoke anonymously with the New York Times, the incident involved possible sexual misconduct between Kavanaugh and the woman.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Member John N.

"It\'s important that this is a through interview."\n\nCollins’ comments comes after The Washington Post published a story on Sunday revealing Ford’s name and more details of the alleged sexual assault that occurred when she and Kavanaugh were in high school.\n\nThe Maine lawmaker added that she could not answer questions regarding the veracity of Ford\'s accusations, but noted that if they prove true, Kavanaugh would be disqualified for the Supreme Court nomination.\n\n"I don’t know enough about Dr. Ford and her allegations to reach judgment of the allegations," Collins said. "Obviously if Kavanaugh has lied about what happened that would disqualify him."\n\nCollins spoke with Kavanaugh last Friday shortly after the then-anonymous allegations surfaced and said the federal judge denied ever assaulting any woman.\n\n"When I had my phone call with him last week he emphatically said he never had an encounter like this," she added.\n\nDemocrats and some Republican senators have expressed concern over Ford\'s accusation that a drunken Kavanaugh groped her and tried to take off her clothes at a party when both were teenagers in suburban Maryland.\n\nKavanaugh released a new statement Monday calling the allegation "completely false" and saying he "had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself" to The Washington Post.\n\n"I am willing to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee in any way the committee deems appropriate to refute this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity," Kavanaugh said.\n\nDebra Katz, the attorney for the accuser, said Ford was willing to tell her story publicly to the judiciary panel but no lawmakers had yet contacted her.

article_113 = 'The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday released a lightly redacted copy of the transcript of Monday’s conference call between Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and committee staff.\n\nThe call, conducted under threat of criminal penalty for lying, reveals an exasperated Kavanaugh countering accusation after accusation, likening his situation to an episode of The Twilight Zone.\n\nThe transcript reveals previously unknown details and one heretofore unrevealed accusation involving Kavanaugh and a man, suggested to be Mark Judge, sexually assaulting a woman on a boat off the coast of Newport, Rhode Island, in 1985, only to be confronted the next morning by two men who then severely beat Kavanaugh and Judge.\n\nThis new fifth accuser, according to the Senate Judiciary Committee staffer on the call, conveyed his allegations by telephone on Monday to Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). The staffer then read Whitehouse’s office’s report over the phone:\n\nSenator Whitehouse received a call this morning from a Rhode Island constituent, [REDACTED], who made allegations regarding U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. [REDACTED] reported that early on a Sunday morning in August of 1985, a close acquaintance of the constituent was sexually assaulted by two heavily inebriated men she referred to at the time as Brett and Mark. The event took place on a 36-foot maroon and white boat in the harbor at Newport, Rhode Island, after the three had met at a local bar. According to [REDACTED], when he learned of the assault at approximately 5:00 a.m. that same morning, he and another individual went to the harbor, located the boat the victim had described and physically confronted the two men, leaving them with significant injuries. [REDACTED] recently realized that one of the men was Brett Kavanaugh when he saw Kavanaugh’s high school yearbook photo on television over the weekend. He promptly reported the incident to our office on Monday morning, September 24, 2018.\n\nThe newest accuser’s name is left redacted in the transcript, but reporters quickly identified the Twitter account quoted in the same transcript as making repeated calls for the U.S. military to carry out a coup against President Donald Trump. The Twitter account belongs to a man named Jeffrey Catalan. As Fox News’s Alex Pfeiffer pointed out, the same account also suggested Donald Trump killed someone in 1983:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/PfeifferDC/status/1045096733926203392\n\nAs reporters began to swarm the Catalan account, it appeared to withdraw his claims of having beaten Kavanaugh up for raping someone, saying, “Do [sic] everyone who is going crazy about what I had said I have recanted because I have made a mistake and apologize for such mistake”:\n\nDo everyone who is going crazy about what I had said I have recanted because I have made a mistake and apologize for such mistake — Jeffrey Catalan (@JeffreyCatala16) September 26, 2018\n\nOn Monday, days before this apparent retraction, Kavanaugh categorically denied Catalan’s accusation, saying, “I was not in Newport, haven’t been on a boat in Newport. Not with Mark Judge on a boat, nor all those three things combined. This is just completely made up, or at least not me. I don’t know what they’re referring to.”\n\nAlso first unveiled in the transcript are new details of the fourth accusation, an anonymous letter alleging Kavanaugh “shoved” the writer’s daughter’s friend “up against the wall very aggressively and sexually” after leaving a bar together in 1998. The letter is revealed to have originated in Denver, Colorado. The unnamed daughter is supposedly from Boulder, Colorado. And Kavanaugh is said to have been “dating” the women he shoved.\n\n“[W]e’re dealing with an anonymous letter about an anonymous person and an anonymous friend. It’s ridiculous. Total twilight zone. And no, I’ve never done anything like that,” Kavanaugh responded.\n\nWhen a staffer asked Kavanaugh about dating the unnamed woman in the letter, Kavanaugh pointed out that the accusation provides nothing that could identify the woman in question in the following exchange:\n\nStaffer: While you were involved in the Starr investigation, do you recall ever dating a woman who would fairly fit the description in the letter provided to Senator [Cory] Gardner [(R-CO)]? The anonymous letter. Judge Kavanaugh: What’s the description? Staffer: Just based on what I — Judge Kavanaugh: Describe her appearance. Staffer: No, it’s — all we have is what I read. Judge Kavanaugh: Well, then I don’t know what I’m responding to then.\n\nIn his most in-depth answers so far revealed about his second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, Kavanaugh again denied having exposed himself to her in a drunken dormitory common room party his freshman year of college. He acknowledges the two knew each other in college, describing their relationship as “friendly, but not friends.” Kavanaugh’s confirmed the two had seen each since college, most recently at a mutual classmate’s wedding, where, as Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer’s New Yorker story noted, she did not mention the alleged incident and posed “smiling” in photographs with Kavanaugh.\n\n“I’m sure I saw her because it wasn’t a huge wedding. And at any wedding, you would see the people that you went to school with. But I don’t have a specific recollection,” Kavanaugh said.\n\nJames Roche, Kavanaugh’s freshman roommate — who told reporters that Kavanaugh was an excessive drinker and that he believed Ramirez, who was a close college friend, despite having no recollection of such an incident — also came up in the questioning. Kavanaugh claimed Roche, who then went by Jamie, “hated” their third roommate, Dave White:\n\nJamie and Dave White hated each other. They got in fights, fist fights during the year. One time Dave White was away for the weekend. Jamie — when he came back, Jamie had moved all Dave White’s furniture, everything, like into some other area of Lawrence Hall in a hallway.\n\nHe continued:\n\nI was friends with Dave White more than Jamie. I tried to be civil. Jamie wasn’t around a lot. I don’t know, I think his parents lived nearby, and so he was elsewhere or with a girl, I don’t know, a woman at Yale. [REDACTED] He didn’t hang out with us very much, wasn’t a great situation.\n\nThe transcript also includes extensive questioning about Kavanaugh’s high school yearbook that anti-trump activist and attorney Michael Avenatti has claimed contains secret codes about sexually assaulting girls. In one exchange, Kavanaugh explained that “devil’s triangle” referred to a drinking game he’d played in high school, not, as Avenatti claimed, a lewd sex act. Asked why he included the reference, Kavanaugh responded, “I don’t know. We were 17.”\n\nKavanaugh’s first use of the phrase “twilight zone,” which he also used in response to Avenatti’s client Julie Swetnick’s claims, occurs when discussing how “outraged” he is by the New Yorker/Deborah Ramirez story:\n\nThe New York Times says as recently as last week, she was calling around to other classmates saying she wasn’t sure I had done this. And you know, I think — I think we’re — this is an outrage for this kind of thin, uncorroborated, 35-year-old accusation to be leveled in this fashion at this time. I’ve been in the public eye for 24 years, since I started with the independent counsel in the fall of 1994, very public at various points in my life. I’ve been through six background checks. I worked in the White House at the highest levels, senior staff, traveling with the President all over the world, seeing the most highly sensitive secrets of our Nation for years. I went through a difficult confirmation process for the D.C. Circuit that was public with two separate confirmation hearings in 2004 and 2006. I’ve been a judge for 12 years in a very public way. I’ve been identified repeatedly as a potential Supreme Court nominee. Whether that was accurate or not, I’ve been publicly identified. My decisions have been publicly discussed. I’ve been very much a presence at the Yale College reunions. I’ve been on multiple panels there. So I’ve been active in the class. The class newsletter has talked about me. The people in my class have been at those reunions and those events. In all that time, not a word. And then 4 days, you know, when just right before a vote for the Supreme Court, after the nomination itself has been pending for months, and I’ve been through the hearings and 65 Senate meetings and all the written questions, and then — and then, after all these years, with all this time, and all these descriptions with no corroboration and with her best friend saying she never heard about it, you know, I’m — I’m really just, you know, stunned. And outraged. It’s the twilight zone. I guess we’re going to get to a few more of these twilight zone things…\n\nKavanaugh will testify in an open hearing Thursday morning to answer allegations from his first accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.'

article_114 = 'Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) invented Democrats’ smear tactics and “[Sen.] Dianne Feinstein perfected,” his smear tactics against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh, Montana state auditor Matt Rosendale told Breitbart News Saturday.\n\nRosendale, who hopes to defeat Sen. Tester in the Montana Senate race, told Breitbart News Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle that Tester invented the very smear tactics Democrats have used to smear Judge Kavanaugh’s name.\n\n“The only thing Judge Kavanaugh is guilty of is agreeing to serve on the Supreme Court and being nominated by President Trump,” Rosendale said. “That’s it, and the people of this state are disgusted with the demonstration that they saw over the last several weeks. Jon Tester invented this smear tactic, and Dianne Feinstein perfected it.” [Emphasis added.]\n\nRosendale reminded Breitbart News Saturday listeners that Tester, as the ranking member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, infamously tanked the nomination of President Donald Trump’s personal physician Admiral Ronnie Jackson with unfounded lies, accusations so that he could not serve as the Secretary of the Veterans Affairs Department.\n\n“What Tester did to Admiral Jackson should never be allowed,” Trump said. “Ronnie Jackson is a great man,” President Trump said a rally in Billings, Montana, in September.\n\nRosendale explained how the Montana Democrat invented the very tactics that Feinstein and other Democrats have used to attack Judge Kavanaugh.\n\nThe Montana conservative said, “The Washington Democrats’ smear tactic is just unacceptable to the people out here. Jon Tester came out and took a good man, admirable, Ronnie Jackson had been nominated for Veterans Affairs and released a bunch of information that was proven to be false.”\n\nSen. Tester announced last week that he would oppose Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, citing the nominee’s alleged positions on privacy, campaign finance, and the allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford. The Montana Democrat also said that he wished he could have met with Kavanaugh to discuss his concerns with the nominee; however, Rosendale contends that Tester had plenty of time to meet with the president’s nominee.\n\nRosendale said that Republicans “are extremely fired up I have had an overwhelming outpouring of support over the last couple of weeks because Jon made it clear and stated that he was not going to support Brett Kavanaugh. He told folks 90 days ago when Judge Kavanaugh was first nominated that he was going to give him the opportunity to meet with him and explain his positions on things, 30 days go by he wouldn’t take the meeting. Sixty days go by he wouldn’t take the meeting.”\n\n“He says that the White House canceled his meeting with Judge Kavanaugh and that’s why he wasn’t able to get the meeting,” Rosendale continued. “The White House came out and said that was completely false. Labor Day Weekend, the newspapers come out and print retractions, and he said he was mistaken, it wasn’t really the White House.”\n\nThe Montana Republican said that Tester support all of Barack Obama’s nominations 100 percent of the time, including Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor who said that the right to bear arms is not a “fundamental right.”\n\nRosendale charged, “Well I would tell you something, the folks of Montana overwhelming understand, not just believe, that it’s clearly written in our Constitution that the right to own a gun is a fundamental right and we should not be confirming a Supreme Court Justice who doesn’t understand that.”\n\nBoyle noted that Republicans and the American have become energized by the Supreme Court nomination process.\n\n“The Silent Majority is not so silent anymore,” Boyle contended.\n\nRosendale said that there’s an incredible amount of energy in Montana right now and his campaign will host a “Support Kavanaugh” rally on Saturday.\n\nRosendale concluded, “We’re having a ‘Support Kavanaugh’ rally in Billings, Montana today and the energy and enthusiasm is incredible. I got folks, and many of them are political pundits that have been involved for many years saying they have not seen anything like this in ten years.”\n\nBreitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern.'

article_115 = 'Debra Katz, attorney for Christine Blasey Ford, revealed Friday that her client will not urge lawmakers to further investigate allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nIn a sit-down interview with CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash, Katz said Ford does not want Democrats to pursue allegations against Kavanaugh if they retake Congress in November. “Professor Ford has not asked for anything of the sort. What she did was to come forward and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and agree to cooperate with any investigation by the FBI, and that’s what she sought to do here,” said Katz.\n\nAsked if Ford would like Democrats to consider bringing impeachment hearings against Kavanaugh, Katz responded with a simple “no.”\n\nLisa Banks, another lawyer for Ford, told Bash that the 51-year-old California psychology professor is at peace with her decision to go public with her decades-old allegation against the judge. “I don’t think she has any regrets. I think she feels like she did the right thing,” said Banks. “And this was what she wanted to do, which was provide this information to the committee so they could make the best decision possible. And I think she still feels that was the right thing to do, so I don’t think she has any regrets.”\n\nFurther, Banks criticized Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans for pointing out Ford was mistaken when she accused chairman Grassley of failing to accommodate her by traveling to her the West Coast to intimate her. “We, as her counsel, informed her of all options made available to us by the committee. We showed her all of the correspondence,” she told Bash “And what they were offering was sending staffers to speak to her. Dr. Ford wanted to speak to the committee members herself. And I think what you saw in the hearing was that Dr. Ford got a little confused and thought Sen. Grassley was suggesting that he himself would have come to California, which is not what he offered at all.”\n\nFord’s lawyers also said Ford was saddened by President Donald Trump’s remarks about her during a rally in Mississippi earlier this week. “It was very hurtful, as it would be to any woman. Any survivor who had the courage to come forward only to be mocked and belittled by anyone really, but certainly by the President of the United States, it was very upsetting. It was very hurtful,” Banks said.'

article_116 = 'Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” MSNBC host Chris Matthews said the way the Republican Party has handled Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh showed an “I Love Lucy”-era in thinking of women.\n\nMatthews said, “There’s something in the Republican conversation last week that was different than that, there’s sort of an ‘I Love Lucy’-era in thinking of women and the way they’re portrayed by it. Plow through it, no, it’s a person. I like the way Nikki Haley, when someone called her confused she said I don’t get confused. I think the fact that women are confused or mistaken as Orrin Hatch put it is really a problem for the Republicans with women.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'

article_117 = 'CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said on Wednesday evening that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will get confirmed if Christine Blasey Ford, the Northern California psychology professor who has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers, does not testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday.\n\n“If she refuses to testify on Monday, Kavanaugh is getting confirmed. Jeff Flake has said that. Susan Collins has said that,” Toobin said on Anderson Cooper 360. “If she maintains that this investigation is a sham and I’m not taking part, he is getting confirmed. Now that may not unfair. That may not be a good thing, a bad thing, I think that’s just factual.”\n\nToobin added that if Ford does testify, then “all the cards are thrown up in the air.”\n\n“He may well be confirmed anyway,” he continued. “But I think everybody should be clear about what the stakes are of her decision to come forward or not before the committee. It’s up or down.”\n\nOne of Ford’s lawyers, Lisa Banks, told CNN’s Cooper on Tuesday evening that Ford did not want to testify before an FBI investigation and was “not prepared” to do so before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) gave Ford a Friday morning (10 a.m.) deadline to decide whether she wants to testify on Monday and even offered to send committee staff to California if that would be more convenient for Ford.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Banks, Ford’s lawyer, indicated that Ford wants “multiple witnesses” to be included in the hearing.\n\n“She continues to believe that a full non-partisan investigation of this matter is needed and she is willing to cooperate with the Committee,” Banks said in a statement. “However, the Committee’s stated plan to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigation; there are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding.”'

article_118 = 'Leftists are trying to kick the Senate confirmation for a Supreme Court nominee down field and past the November elections.\n\nThey have shown they will do so at any cost. While compelling emotionally, Christine Blasey Ford has no witnesses and no facts to back up her story.\n\nThere was no legitimate reason the allegations were not summarily evaluated, and a Judiciary Committee vote was taken last week.\n\nI was honored to be able to attend Friday’s Kavanaugh hearing – a hearing that should never have taken place. It was intense, dramatic, emotional, and outrageous, but nothing changed. The allegations are not sufficient to derail Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination.\n\nLeftist law breaking, rule breaking, violence, and disruption have already marred the public Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. The Senate has allowed this circus to continue, and in the process has delayed a timely confirmation vote on Judge Kavanaugh.\n\nThe vote to confirm can’t come soon enough. That the Senate hasn’t voted yet is shameful.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee issued a statement requesting that the administration instruct the FBI to conduct a supplemental FBI background investigation with respect to the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Senate request was for the FBI to investigation “credible allegations.” There are no “credible allegations.”\n\nNevertheless, President Trump authorized the supplemental investigation as requested.\n\nIf fairly conducted, this “supplemental investigation” could have been over yesterday. The Committee requested that the FBI investigation take no more than a week. This will not satisfy Leftists trying to destroy Kavanaugh.\n\nAfter witnessing the spectacle in person yesterday, the Senate owes Judge Kavanaugh an apology. And perhaps the best apology would be a vote finally to confirm him.\n\nTom Fitton is president of Judicial Watch.'

I can’t think of anything more—inappropriate is not descriptive enough—it’s mean. It’s mean. It’s completely without any level of empathy,” Harris continued. “What was the purpose of saying that and doing that? I can’t understand it, and I’m embarrassed that the president of the United States would do that to this woman.”\n\nThe Atlantic noted that Harris “offered a preview” during the interview “of how she might respond to attacks from” Trump “if she runs against him in 2020: by appealing to Americans’ sense of compassion.”"
