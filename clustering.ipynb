Pathetic.\\xa0<a>As my new book\\xa0</a><em>Militant Normals: How Regular Americans Are Rebelling Against the Elite to Reclaim Our Democracy\\xa0</em>explains\\xa0(and you must order it now because it comes out next Tuesday), this illustrates the disconnect between status-obsessed elites (including conservativish ones in the Senate) and Normal people who want to cut through the San Francisco sidewalk stuff.</p>\\n\\n<p>Our GOP senators are more concerned with their reputations in the Beltway Bubble, while <strong>Normal people just want to get at the truth.</strong> And to get at it, their questioning would be very different than the kind of “We want to nurture and support you in this difficult time” garbage we’re likely to hear from people who should be shredding her flimsy fabric of lies.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Here are questions I’d ask if I were a senator doing the questioning, along with some anticipated colloquy with my distinguished colleagues.</strong></p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>1. Dr. Ford, you are a committed liberal, correct?</p>\\n\\n<p>[“<em>Senator Feinstein’s objection that my question undermines the witness’s credibility is noted and disregarded.”</em>]</p>\\n\\n<p>2. And it’s true that you wouldn’t want Future Justice Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court because of his conservative judicial philosophy regardless of the alleged incident?</p>\\n\\n<p>3. Your lawyers are Democrat activists, right?</p>\\n\\n<p>4. Are they working for free, or do you intend to pay them with the several hundred thousand dollars the\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/help-christine-blasey-ford\">various</a>\\xa0GoFundMe\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/to-cover-dr-fords-security-costs\">campaigns</a>\\xa0in your name have raised?</p>\\n\\n<p>5. You traveled to Hawaii in your work and back east in August. So, when did that “fear of flying” we heard about start and stop?</p>\\n\\n<p>[“<em>Mr. Chairman, Senator Flake’s winking at the cameras of the liberal media outlets is distracting me. I know he needs a job, but let him suck up to MSNBC on his own time.”</em>]</p>\\n\\n<p>6. So, Dr. Ford, let’s get to the basics. Exactly what day and time did this incident happen?</p>\\n\\n<p>7. Exactly where did this incident happen?</p>\\n\\n<p>8. How many people were in the house at the time?</p>\\n\\n<p>[“<em>Mr. Chairman, I’ll pause my questioning to let Senator Hirono count the number on her fingers. While she’s trying to work it out, I’m hitting the head.”</em>]</p>\\n\\n<p>9. In 2012, your therapist wrote down that there were four people in the room. Why would she do that if you didn’t tell her that?</p>\\n\\n<p>10. Do you find it odd that each person who you now say was present has stated that they have no idea what you are talking about?</p>\\n\\n<p>11. If they might not remember because the party was nothing special, how often did you and your teen pals go to houses with a bunch of boys and get drunk?</p>\\n\\n<p>12. You claim Future Justice Kavanaugh was drunk. How drunk were you?</p>\\n\\n<p>13. As a psychologist, will you concede that alcohol inebriation will make a teenager’s memory unreliable?\\xa0</p>\\n\\n<p>[“<em>Senator Sasse, your\\xa0</em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X9E9n6GHC8\"><em>Fredocon</em></a><em>\\xa0whining about how we’re better than this and how this is not who we are is noted. I’ll ask my questions however I damn well please.”</em>]</p>\\n\\n<p>14. You claim you thought Future Justice Kavanaugh was trying to rape you. If so, why didn’t he chase you and actually rape you?</p>\\n\\n<p>15. You say you left the house without telling anyone. Doesn’t that seem like something odd that your female friend would remember?</p>\\n\\n<p>16. If you thought Future Justice Kavanaugh was going to rape you, why would you leave your friend alone there with this alleged monster?</p>\\n\\n<p>17. And you didn’t call the cops, right?</p>\\n\\n<p>18. You didn’t tell your parents?</p>\\n\\n<p>19. You didn’t even tell your friends?</p>\\n\\n<p>20. But you happened to tell your therapist in 2012, right around the time Future Justice Kavanaugh’s name was being brought up as a Supreme Court candidate?</p>\\n\\n<p>[<em>“Mr. Chairman, can you have the withered commie crone dressed as a handmaid dragged out so I can continue?]</em></p>\\n\\n<p>21. Future Justice Kavanaugh was a big deal in 2012, and you say you mentioned his name, but it’s not in your therapist’s notes. It’s not even in there that your attacker is now a well-known judge. Your therapist sure got a lot wrong, didn’t she?</p>\\n\\n<p>22. Say, at any time, did\\xa0<a>Future Justice Kavanaugh\\xa0</a>suggest that you put some ice on that?</p>\\n\\n<p>23. Did Future Justice Kavanaugh slap you around like a Democrat congressman from Minnesota?</p>\\n\\n<p>24. Did Future Justice Kavanaugh drive hammered and leave you to drown in an Oldsmobile?</p>\\n\\n<p>[“<em>Mr. Chairman, let’s pause. Senator Sasse spilled the pearls he was clutching.</em>”]</p>\\n\\n<p>25. You say this event damaged you permanently, but you did not seek treatment before 2012 even though you are a psychologist, correct?</p>\\n\\n<p>26. You wanted to remain anonymous, right?</p>\\n\\n<p>[<em>“Mr. Chairman, can you have the screeching B-movie actress dressed as a handmaid dragged out so I can continue?”</em>]</p>\\n\\n<p>27. You sent a letter to your congresswoman in July, right?</p>\\n\\n<p>28. You hired a famous, leftist lawyer in D.C. in August, right?</p>\\n\\n<p>29. You say you took a lie detector test in August, right?</p>\\n\\n<p>30. But you contacted the\\xa0<em>Washington Post</em>, but did you really think they would do anything about it before you gave them your name?</p>\\n\\n<p>31. And you’re here voluntarily, not even under subpoena, right?</p>\\n\\n<p>32. You never intended to remain anonymous, did you?</p>\\n\\n<p>[<em>“Mr. Chairman, can you have the beta male dressed as a handmaid dragged out so I can continue?”</em>]</p>\\n\\n<p>33. Are you aware that people are calling you “brave”?</p>\\n\\n<p>34. Are you aware that people are calling you a “hero”?</p>\\n\\n<p>35. And are you aware that Anita Hill has been celebrated as a brave liberal hero since the Justice Thomas hearings?</p>\\n\\n<p>36. As a psychologist, you are aware that sometimes people say things that are not true to get attention, correct?</p>\\n\\n<p>37. As a psychologist, you are aware that sometimes people enjoy the spotlight?</p>\\n\\n<p>38. As a psychologist, isn’t it possible that someone might invent a claim of assault in order to get attention or achieve a political goal?</p>\\n\\n<p>[<em>“Mr. Chairman, I need to pause to let Senator Spartacus take a call from T-Bone.”</em>]</p>\\n\\n<p>39. As a psychologist, do you disagree with the consensus that sexual abusers repeat their crimes?</p>\\n\\n<p>40. How do you account for the fact that not one single person, besides you, has claimed that Future Justice Kavanaugh has ever tackled someone and tried to rip off her clothes?</p>\\n\\n<p>41. Sixty-five women signed a letter saying Future Justice Kavanaugh was always a perfect gentleman. Why would they all lie?</p>\\n\\n<p>42. No one allegedly in the house for the alleged party corroborates your story. Why would they all lie?</p>\\n\\n<p>43. For that matter, no one at the dorm corroborates that other leftist woman’s story either. Why would they all lie?</p>\\n\\n<p>44. And, of course, no one corroborates Stripper Matlock’s story, right?</p>\\n\\n<p>45.

       "' The Dems and the media said Bill Clinton\\'s sexual misconduct, including the rape of Juanita Broaddrick, was irrelevant to Clinton serving as president.  They also said Teddy Kennedy\\'s driving his car into the pond drunk at Chappaquiddick, leaving Mary Jo Kopechne to die, while he swam away and waited twelve hours to report to the police, was irrelevant to him serving as senator and running for the presidency. Now the Dems and the media say any claim of sexual misconduct, no matter how remote and unreliable, is enough to destroy the life of Brett Kavanaugh because they are afraid he will cast a vote to overrule Roe v. Wade. Christine Blasey Ford sent a letter dated July 30, 2018 to Dianne Feinstein stating that in the early 1980s, she was at a \"gathering\" at a home in suburban Maryland with four others.  Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, both drunk, forced her into a room and locked the door, and Kavanaugh then got on top of her.  Judge also \"periodically\" jumped on top of both.  Kavanaugh put a hand over her mouth and she believed he would \"inadvertently\" kill her.  At one point, Judge jumped on both again, and she took this \"opportune\" moment to run outside and go home. Ford reported this incident to her \"local government representative\" on July 6, 2018. Ford wrote to Feinstein to provide \"relevant information regarding the current nominee\" to the Supreme Court. It is important to read the actual letter to see how unreliable it is: July 30 2018  CONFIDENTIAL Senator Dianne Feinstein Dear Senator Feinstein; I am writing with information relevant in evaluating the current nominee to the Supreme Court. As a constituent, I expect that you will maintain this as confidential until we have further opportunity to speak.  Brett Kavanaugh physically and sexually assaulted me during high school in the early 1980\\'s.  He conducted these acts with the assistance of REDACTED.  Both were one to two years older than me and students at a local private school. The assault occurred in a suburban Maryland area home at a gathering that included me and four others.  Kavanaugh physically pushed me into a bedroom as I was headed for a bathroom up a short stair well [sic] from the living room.  They locked the door and played loud music precluding any successful attempt to yell for help.  Kavanaugh was on top of me while laughing with REDACTED, who periodically jumped onto Kavanaugh.  They both laughed as Kavanaugh tried to disrobe me in their highly inebriated state.  With Kavanaugh\\'s hand over my mouth I feared he may inadvertently kill me.  From across the room a very drunken REDACTED said mixed words to Kavanaugh ranging from \"go for it\" to \"stop.\"  At one point when REDACTED jumped onto the bed the weight on me was substantial.  The pile toppled, and the two scrapped with each other.  After a few attempts to get away, I was able to take this opportune moment to get up and run across to a hallway bathroom.  I locked the bathroom door behind me.  Both loudly stumbled down the stair well at which point other persons at the house were talking with them.  I exited the bathroom, ran outside of the house and went home.  I have not knowingly seen Kavanaugh since the assault.  I did see REDACTED once at the REDACTED where he was extremely uncomfortable seeing me. I have received medical treatment regarding the assault.  On July 6 I notified my local government representative to ask them [sic] how to proceed with sharing this information.  It is upsetting to discuss sexual assault and its repercussions, yet I felt guilty and compelled as a citizen about the idea of not saying anything. I am available to speak further should you wish to discuss.  I am currently REDACTED and will be in REDACTED. In confidence, REDACTED. Ford did not report this until 2012, when she was in couples\\' therapy, where she reported it to her therapist.  The therapist notes do not include Kavanaugh\\'s name, which Ford blames on the therapist.  Her husband, Russell Ford, said he remembered his wife specifically using Kavanaugh\\'s name during the 2012 therapy session and that they were concerned that Kavanaugh would be nominated to the Supreme Court. First, why, if this happened, didn\\'t this 15-year-old girl immediately tell her parents that she was attacked and then report to the police?  The police could then have questioned everyone at the \"gathering.\"  She says she thought Kavanaugh would inadvertently kill her, yet she does not report this to her parents and the police?  This isn\\'t credible.  According to the Post, her explanation is as follows: My biggest fear was, do I look like someone just attacked me?  I\\'m not ever telling anyone this.  This is nothing, it didn\\'t happen, and he didn\\'t rape me. Her parents would not believe her because she didn\\'t look as though someone had attacked her?  What parents will not believe their 15-year-old daughter who runs home to tell them drunken boys tried to rape her? Second, Kavanaugh has been investigated by the FBI for appointments to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, White House counsel, and other federal jobs.  Why didn\\'t Ford call the FBI so the FBI could investigate Kavanaugh? Third, Mark Judge has denied the accusation. Fourth, according to her husband, the motivation for telling the therapist in 2012 was that Kavanaugh might be appointed to the Supreme Court.  This shows political motivation: she does not want Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, although she did not care that he was on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Fifth, why write to a \"local government representative\" on July 6, 2018 and then Feinstein on July 30, 2018 instead of contacting the FBI?  The \"local\" Democrat and Feinstein should have immediately referred this to the FBI for investigation.  Feinstein should have immediately shared the letter with the entire Judiciary Committee so members could question Kavanaugh.  Instead, Feinstein played a political game to wait for an ambush. Sixth, note the odd language in the letter.  She was at a \"gathering,\" not a party.  She contacted her \"local Democratic representative\" to find out how to proceed.  She is a college professor, yet she acts as though she doesn\\'t know to call the FBI.  She says she received \"medical treatment\" \"for the assault,\" but aside from one couples therapy session in 2012, there is no mention of any other treatment. Seventh, Ford said there were four boys at the \"gathering.\"  Her attorney, Debra Katz, now says there was a girl present. Ford\\'s letter of July 30 and her therapy notes of 2012 show her motivation and provide much material for a vigorous cross-examination if this were a case handled by real attorneys. Unfortunately, we have weak Republicans who will be afraid to ask Ford tough questions for fear of backlash and bad press from the swamp.  The Dems will give speeches attacking Kavanaugh and Trump.  Kavanaugh will testify with candor and credibility that he did not attack Ford.  There is no pattern or other accusations, as with Bill Clinton and others. We do not know if Ford will appear on Monday, September 24 to testify under oath and answer questions on cross-exam.  The latest is that Ford wants the FBI to investigate before she testifies.  The bottom line is that Ford and the Dems and the media want to delay the vote and hope Kavanaugh withdraws. Ford and the Dems and the media know that her story will not hold up.

       "' In a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein and an article in the Washington Post, Christine Blasey Ford has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Georgetown Prep classmate Mark Judge of sexually assaulting her.  She claims that this happened somewhere around 1982 when she was 15 years old and consisted of Kavanaugh groping her while holding her down with his hand over her mouth so she couldn&apost scream while both 17-year-olds laughed maniacally.  As corroborating evidence of the assault, she provided partial notes from couples&apos therapy she attended with her husband in 2012.  She released only selected portions of her therapist&aposs notes – what would Democrats call that?  Oh yeah, \"cherry-picking,\" just as many Democrats have described what Trump is choosing to declassify with respect to the Carter Page FISA Court applications.  Her therapist&aposs notes describe an attempted sexual assault, but neither Kavanaugh nor Judge is mentioned.  In addition, her therapist&aposs notes say there were four boys present \"from an elitist boys&apos school,\" whereas in the Feinstein letter, she claims only two assailants (Kavanaugh and Judge).  Both have categorically denied the allegations, with Judge calling the accusation \"absolutely nuts.\" Blasey Ford says the therapist made a mistake in his notes.  Her claim is that a therapist, who by definition and job description must rely heavily on his notes to delineate and document needed therapy, made a mistake.  Yet, though he was incompetent enough to make an error of fact, he was still sufficiently competent to save his notes for six years. In addition to the discrepancy, also note the term \"elitist,\" a word that was not commonly used in 1982 to describe a private school, especially by a private school girl.  In the hyper-class-conscious world of 2012, however, it was in broad usage.  To me, this shows that her memory had at least to some extent been adjusted by her later political indoctrination. The corroborating (at least, to her, her lawyer, and the media) therapist&aposs notes, apart from being incomplete and listing the wrong number of assailants, also do not mention Kavanaugh, whose name came up only in discussions she had with her husband in 2012.  In the Washington Post article, her husband told the author, \"he recalled that his wife used Kavanaugh&aposs last name and voiced concern that Kavanaugh – then a federal judge – might one day be nominated to the Supreme Court.\"  This is another political aspect of her accusation; she sees her alleged assault through the prism of Kavanaugh&aposs politics and potential Supreme Court nomination.  In the letter to Feinstein, she calls the get-together a \"gathering,\" and it has been described elsewhere as a \"party.\"  This is easy to understand since either one sounds a lot better than saying she went to a house to hang out with four boys to drink and smoke pot. Her attorney&aposs later addition of another female to the group should be taken the same way.  It sounds better that she went with another girl than alone to a \"party,\" \"gathering,\" or \"hangout.\"  I would also note that while it&aposs possible to forget the names of the male attendees, the location of the party, and the year of the hangout, were there another girl present, I would think she not only would remember that girl&aposs name, but probably would have told her what happened as well. Another \"elitist\" classmate, Patrick J. Smyth, had this to say: \"I understand that I have been identified by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as the person she remembers as &aposPJ&apos who supposedly was present at the party she described in her statements to the Washington Post[.]\"  Smyth has also said (in a letter to the Judiciary Committee), \"I am issuing this statement today to make it clear to all involved that I have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh.\" She claims that she never told anyone contemporaneously, and for 30 years, she repressed the memory, recovering it only during her 2012 therapy.  Weren&apost there a whole bunch of people who went to prison as the result of repressed and recovered memories, only to be later exonerated?  No matter; they can be trusted this time as reason enough to ruin a man&aposs life, reputation, and career. Were one to accept her story as true, it would be understandable why she would not tell the authorities or her parents.  It would be embarrassing to admit she went with four boys to hang out, drink, and smoke pot.  In addition, being roughly fondled, however wrongly, probably would not have been considered a sexual assault in 1982. It is also understandable how she wouldn&apost know the location of the house or its owner.  Presumably, she was with people she trusted (or she wouldn&apost have gone) and didn&apost require it.  At 15 years old, she would have been driven there and probably was not paying attention, perhaps because she was conversing with those in the car.  One would think, though, she would remember those in the car.  But it&aposs still somewhat believable that she might not remember getting there or where it was. But... How did she get home?  According to her story, she had been so traumatized that she claimed in the Feinstein letter she \"received medical treatment.\"  She provided no evidence of this because hospitals in 1982 presumably didn&apost keep records, or perhaps she was referring to her therapy, or merely being hyperbolic.  In any case, after a traumatizing assault, she would surely be terrified and looking to get out of there as soon as possible.  Who took her home?  Whoever did take her home would have been her savior and thus at the very least someone she would remember vividly, or at the minimum, his name.  This, to me, is most damning.  Everyone remembers his savior. As Conrad Black says:  Kavanaugh denies it, no one corroborates it, no illegality is alleged, no subsequent claimants of like behavior have come forward, and scores of women who have known the judge for decades have attested to his irreproachable behavior and character.  From Andrew C. McCarthy:  This has all the hallmarks of a set-up.  If the Democrats had raised the allegation in a timely manner, its weakness would have been palpable, it would have been used for what little it&aposs worth in examining Kavanagh [sic] during his days of testimony, it would be put to rest as unverifiable, and we&aposd be on to a confirmation vote.  Instead, we&aposre on to a delay – precisely the Democrats&apos objective.  They want to slow-walk Kavanaugh&aposs confirmation vote until after the midterms, in the hopes that they swing the Senate in their favor and have the numbers to defeat the nomination.  Also from McCarthy:  I don&apost know if something awful really happened to Ford when she was 15.  None of us will ever know.  Apparently, Ford herself does not know basic facts either, since she cannot tell us where and when the alleged assault happened, and what she did in the aftermath.  Giving her the benefit of the doubt that it happened as she claims it happened, she hasn&apost come close to establishing that Brett Kavanaugh, as opposed to some other kid she has forgotten, was her assailant; that is, she has not established that her memory of the assailant can be trusted when she cannot recall other rudimentary details.  We can feel sympathy for her while nevertheless inferring that she does not want to testify because she cannot explain the oddities of her account.  Or we can justifiably suspect that the whole thing is a partisan stunt.  In my opinion, she should have stayed \"anonymous.\"  We know how much the left likes \"anonymous\" allegations.In a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein and an article in the Washington Post, Christine Blasey Ford has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Georgetown Prep classmate Mark Judge of sexually assaulting her.

As Conrad Black says:  Kavanaugh denies it, no one corroborates it, no illegality is alleged, no subsequent claimants of like behavior have come forward, and scores of women who have known the judge for decades have attested to his irreproachable behavior and character.  From Andrew C. McCarthy:  This has all the hallmarks of a set-up.  If the Democrats had raised the allegation in a timely manner, its weakness would have been palpable, it would have been used for what little it&aposs worth in examining Kavanagh [sic] during his days of testimony, it would be put to rest as unverifiable, and we&aposd be on to a confirmation vote.  Instead, we&aposre on to a delay – precisely the Democrats&apos objective.  They want to slow-walk Kavanaugh&aposs confirmation vote until after the midterms, in the hopes that they swing the Senate in their favor and have the numbers to defeat the nomination.  Also from McCarthy:  I don&apost know if something awful really happened to Ford when she was 15.  None of us will ever know.  Apparently, Ford herself does not know basic facts either, since she cannot tell us where and when the alleged assault happened, and what she did in the aftermath.  Giving her the benefit of the doubt that it happened as she claims it happened, she hasn&apost come close to establishing that Brett Kavanaugh, as opposed to some other kid she has forgotten, was her assailant; that is, she has not established that her memory of the assailant can be trusted when she cannot recall other rudimentary details.  We can feel sympathy for her while nevertheless inferring that she does not want to testify because she cannot explain the oddities of her account.  Or we can justifiably suspect that the whole thing is a partisan stunt.  In my opinion, she should have stayed \"anonymous.\"  We know how much the left likes \"anonymous\" allegations. In a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein and an article in the Washington Post, Christine Blasey Ford has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Georgetown Prep classmate Mark Judge of sexually assaulting her.  She claims that this happened somewhere around 1982 when she was 15 years old and consisted of Kavanaugh groping her while holding her down with his hand over her mouth so she couldn&apost scream while both 17-year-olds laughed maniacally.  As corroborating evidence of the assault, she provided partial notes from couples&apos therapy she attended with her husband in 2012.  She released only selected portions of her therapist&aposs notes – what would Democrats call that?  Oh yeah, \"cherry-picking,\" just as many Democrats have described what Trump is choosing to declassify with respect to the Carter Page FISA Court applications.  Her therapist&aposs notes describe an attempted sexual assault, but neither Kavanaugh nor Judge is mentioned.  In addition, her therapist&aposs notes say there were four boys present \"from an elitist boys&apos school,\" whereas in the Feinstein letter, she claims only two assailants (Kavanaugh and Judge).  Both have categorically denied the allegations, with Judge calling the accusation \"absolutely nuts.\" Blasey Ford says the therapist made a mistake in his notes.  Her claim is that a therapist, who by definition and job description must rely heavily on his notes to delineate and document needed therapy, made a mistake.  Yet, though he was incompetent enough to make an error of fact, he was still sufficiently competent to save his notes for six years. In addition to the discrepancy, also note the term \"elitist,\" a word that was not commonly used in 1982 to describe a private school, especially by a private school girl.  In the hyper-class-conscious world of 2012, however, it was in broad usage.  To me, this shows that her memory had at least to some extent been adjusted by her later political indoctrination. The corroborating (at least, to her, her lawyer, and the media) therapist&aposs notes, apart from being incomplete and listing the wrong number of assailants, also do not mention Kavanaugh, whose name came up only in discussions she had with her husband in 2012.  In the Washington Post article, her husband told the author, \"he recalled that his wife used Kavanaugh&aposs last name and voiced concern that Kavanaugh – then a federal judge – might one day be nominated to the Supreme Court.\"  This is another political aspect of her accusation; she sees her alleged assault through the prism of Kavanaugh&aposs politics and potential Supreme Court nomination.  In the letter to Feinstein, she calls the get-together a \"gathering,\" and it has been described elsewhere as a \"party.\"  This is easy to understand since either one sounds a lot better than saying she went to a house to hang out with four boys to drink and smoke pot. Her attorney&aposs later addition of another female to the group should be taken the same way.  It sounds better that she went with another girl than alone to a \"party,\" \"gathering,\" or \"hangout.\"  I would also note that while it&aposs possible to forget the names of the male attendees, the location of the party, and the year of the hangout, were there another girl present, I would think she not only would remember that girl&aposs name, but probably would have told her what happened as well. Another \"elitist\" classmate, Patrick J. Smyth, had this to say: \"I understand that I have been identified by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as the person she remembers as &aposPJ&apos who supposedly was present at the party she described in her statements to the Washington Post[.]\"  Smyth has also said (in a letter to the Judiciary Committee), \"I am issuing this statement today to make it clear to all involved that I have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh.\" She claims that she never told anyone contemporaneously, and for 30 years, she repressed the memory, recovering it only during her 2012 therapy.  Weren&apost there a whole bunch of people who went to prison as the result of repressed and recovered memories, only to be later exonerated?  No matter; they can be trusted this time as reason enough to ruin a man&aposs life, reputation, and career. Were one to accept her story as true, it would be understandable why she would not tell the authorities or her parents.  It would be embarrassing to admit she went with four boys to hang out, drink, and smoke pot.  In addition, being roughly fondled, however wrongly, probably would not have been considered a sexual assault in 1982. It is also understandable how she wouldn&apost know the location of the house or its owner.  Presumably, she was with people she trusted (or she wouldn&apost have gone) and didn&apost require it.  At 15 years old, she would have been driven there and probably was not paying attention, perhaps because she was conversing with those in the car.  One would think, though, she would remember those in the car.  But it&aposs still somewhat believable that she might not remember getting there or where it was. But... How did she get home?  According to her story, she had been so traumatized that she claimed in the Feinstein letter she \"received medical treatment.\"  She provided no evidence of this because hospitals in 1982 presumably didn&apost keep records, or perhaps she was referring to her therapy, or merely being hyperbolic.  In any case, after a traumatizing assault, she would surely be terrified and looking to get out of there as soon as possible.  Who took her home?  Whoever did take her home would have been her savior and thus at the very least someone she would remember vividly, or at the minimum, his name.  This, to me, is most damning.

       "'\\n\\nWASHINGTON, - Days after being ordered to look into sexual misconduct allegations against US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the FBI has talked with his high school friend Mark Judge, but the interview is not complete, his attorney said on Monday.\\n\\n\\n\\nUniversity professor Christine Blasey Ford has said Judge was a witness when Kavanaugh allegedly sexually assaulted her at a party in 1982 when they were high school students in Maryland.\\n\\nJudge has denied Ford\\'s allegations. Kavanaugh has also denied her accusations as well as those of two other women, while accusing Democrats of a political \"hit.\"Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee voted on Friday in favor of Kavanaugh\\'s nomination, but a full Senate vote on confirmation was delayed for a week after President Donald Trump bowed to pressure from moderate members of his Republican Party for the FBI probe. On Monday, the president, who nominated Kavanaugh to the top US court , said the FBI would have free rein to interview any witnesses it deemed necessary. He added he did not want the probe to become a \"witch hunt\" and that it should be completed quickly.\"I want them to do a very comprehensive investigation. Whatever that means, according to the senators and the Republicans and the Republican majority, I want them to do that,\" Trump said at a White House news conference. His remarks followed criticism by Democrats that he and other Republicans were trying to limit the scope of the FBI probe.Democratic Senator Chris Coons told reporters he was in discussions with the White House on the probe. He said: \"The FBI needs to be allowed to pursue all reasonable investigatory steps from the credible allegations in front of the committee.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber would vote this week on Kavanaugh, a conservative federal appeals court judge in Washington. A spokesman for McConnell declined to clarify whether McConnell was referring to procedural votes or a final vote on confirming Kavanaugh.The Kavanaugh nomination erupted last month into a major controversy that jeopardized an effort by Trump and his fellow Republicans to cement conservative dominance of the nation\\'s highest court and push America\\'s judiciary to the right. Coming just before Nov. 6 elections when control of Congress is at stake, the nomination has become a politically explosive issue, with some Republicans fearing that pushing ahead with confirmation would alienate women voters, while Democrats seek to capitalize.\\'WE REQUEST YOUR PATIENCE\\' Judge\\'s attorney, Barbara \"Biz\" Van Gelder, said in a statement: \"Mr. Judge has been interviewed by the FBI but his interview has not been completed. We request your patience as the FBI completes its investigation.\"Ford said during her testimony at a dramatic Senate hearing last Thursday that Judge was in the bedroom where the alleged assault by Kavanaugh occurred. She said Judge and Kavanaugh were both drunk at the time.Judge has written several books, including one titled \"Wasted: Tales of a Gen X Drunk,\" and one titled \"God and Man at Georgetown Prep: How I Became a Catholic Despite 20 Years of Catholic Schooling.\" He and Kavanaugh were classmates at Georgetown Preparatory School, an elite private school outside Washington. P.J. Smyth, identified by Ford as being at the gathering of teenagers where the alleged assault occurred, was interviewed by the FBI and again denied knowledge of the gathering or of improper conduct by his friend Kavanaugh, Smyth\\'s lawyers said.RAMIREZ, SWETNICKKavanaugh\\'s second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, has also been interviewed by the FBI, said Coons, who played a key role along with Republican Jeff Flake last week in winning the one-week Senate pause.Michael Avenatti, lawyer for the third woman, Julie Swetnick, told CNN on Monday that his client had not been contacted by the FBI.Nine of 10 Democrats on the Judiciary Committee wrote on Monday to FBI Director Christopher Wray and White House Counsel Don McGahn, listing 24 people they said should be interviewed by the FBI, and urging that the investigation assess all three allegations of sexual misconduct.Supreme Court nominations require Senate confirmation.Trump\\'s Republicans control the Senate by a 51-49 margin. That means if all the Democrats vote against Kavanaugh, Trump could not afford to have more than one Republican oppose his nominee, with Vice President Mike Pence casting a tiebreaking vote.Trump said he believed Kavanaugh did not lie during his Judiciary Committee testimony about the extent of his drinking in high school and college.On the other hand, Trump said, if the FBI uncovers something, \"I\\'ll take that into consideration. I have a very open mind.\" Trump did not elaborate.In a statement to media, Chad Ludington, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh, said the judge was not truthful about his drinking during his Senate testimony last week and that at Yale, Kavanaugh was \"a frequent drinker and a heavy drinker\" who often got belligerent and aggressive when drunk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) as well as the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford will be investigated as part of the fallout from the Democrat smear of Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\\n\\n“Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s office will be investigated to determine whether it leaked a confidential letter from one of Brett Kavanaugh’s accusers, Sen. Tom Cotton said Sunday,” according to a report. “Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, also said lawyers recommended to Christine Blasey Ford by Democrats will face a Washington, D.C., bar investigation for telling her that Senate Judiciary Committee staffers would not travel to California to interview her about her sexual-assault allegation.”\\n\\nBoth revelations – that Feinstein’s office likely leaked Ford’s confidential letter, and that her attorney’s failed to tell her that investigators would come to her in California – came from Ford’s testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.'"

       "'Shortly before a third accuser came forward Wednesday, a detailed calendar of Brett Kavanaugh’s activities during the summer of 1982 was entered as evidence to rebut Christine Blasey Ford’s claim that the U.S. Supreme Court nominee sexually assaulted her at a house party while both were in high school.\\n\\nFord and Kavanaugh are expected to testify in a televised hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee at 10 a.m. Thursday.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the lawyer of porn star Stormy Daniels, Michael Avenatti, presented an affidavit from a client, Julie Swetnick, who claims that in approximately 1982, “I became the victim of one of these ‘gang’ or ‘train’ rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present.”\\n\\nLater Wednesday, NBC News reported the Senate Judiciary Committee was inquiring about a fourth allegation of misconduct against Kavanaugh. Sources told NBC that Kavanaugh denied the allegation, which was made in an anonymous complaint sent to Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado. The charge is that Kavanaugh, while inebriated, physically assaulted a woman he socialized with in the Washington, D.C., area in 1998.\\n\\nThe third accuser, Swetnick, claims: “Shortly after the incident, I shared what had transpired with at least two other people. During the incident, I was incapacitated without my consent and unable to fight off the boys raping me. I believe I was drugged using Quaaludes or something similar placed in what I was drinking.”\\n\\nShe does not claim, however, that Kavanaugh raped her.\\n\\nSwetnick’s accusation came after the New Yorker, in a much-maligned piece lacking corroborating witnesses, reported Deborah Ramirez claimed Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party when both were freshmen at Yale University.\\n\\n‘From the Twilight Zone’\\n\\nIn a statement issued Wednesday morning by the White House, Kavanaugh denied Swetnick’s charge.\\n\\n“This is ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone,” he said. “I don’t know who this is and this never happened.”\\n\\nKavanaugh attorney Beth Wilkinson told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer in an interview Wednesday that Kavanaugh is “outraged, as you might imagine, by this latest allegation.”\\n\\n“He has never met this woman, he doesn’t know Ms. Swetnick, he didn’t go to parties with her,” she said.\\n\\nWilkinson said she’s received calls from people who went to high school with Kavanaugh and “no one remembers seeing her at any of the parties they attended.”\\n\\n“They’re absolutely serious allegations if they’re true,” Wilkinson said. “But if that’s so, there’s no excuse for her lawyer not going straight to the police.”\\n\\nShe said there’s “no one stopping any investigation, and any lawyer worth their salt would put their client’s interests first and go straight to the police or to the FBI.”\\n\\nFord’s lawyers submitted sworn and signed declarations from four people who she told about her claims of sexual assault, reported USA Today. But three people she has named as witnesses have declared that they were not at any such party, including a lifelong friend, Leland Ingham Keyser.\\n\\nSignificantly, along with chores and activities with friends, such as movies and beach hangouts, Kavanaugh’s calendar lists five parties he attended. Ford’s name is not mentioned. The psychology professor has said she cannot remember exactly when and where the alleged incident took place.\\n\\nThe Daily Caller reported Ford’s polygraph exam, released on Wednesday, presents another inconsistency in her claim. Her handwritten statement included in the polygraph states there were “4 boys and a couple of girls at the party,” which contradicts her other accounts of how many people were present.\\n\\nAmong other inconsistencies, therapist notes from 2012 that Ford gave to the Washington Post say four boys were in the room when the alleged incident took place. But Ford claims there were only two. She told the Post the discrepancy is due to an error by the therapist.\\n\\nFord says she told no one about the alleged 1982 incident until going through therapy with her husband six years ago.\\n\\nKavanaugh testimony: ‘Misbehavior’ but not assault\\n\\nIn his prepared opening statement for the hearing Thursday, Kavanaugh will admit to excessive drinking and “misbehavior” but declare he has never sexually assaulted anyone.\\n\\n“I spent most of my time in high school focused on academics, sports, church, and service. But I was not perfect in those days, just as I am not perfect today,” Kavanaugh says.\\n\\nHe admits he drank beer with his friends, “usually on weekends,” and sometimes “had too many.”\\n\\n“In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now,” he says. “But that’s not why we are here today. What I’ve been accused of is far more serious than juvenile misbehavior. I never did anything remotely resembling what Dr. Ford describes.”\\n\\nFord will tell the senators that when she was 15 and he was 17, a “visibly drunk” Kavanaugh and a friend corralled her into a bedroom at a party in a Washington suburb in 1982. She says Kavanaugh tried to take off her clothes and put his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream for help.\\n\\n“It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought Brett was accidentally going to kill me,” her testimony says.\\n\\nThe Republican majority on the committee, who are all males, have selected Rachel Mitchell, an Arizona sex crimes prosecutor, to question Ford and Kavanaugh.\\n\\nThe panel’s chairman, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a statement the objective is to “de-politicize the process and get to the truth, instead of grandstanding and giving senators an opportunity to launch their presidential campaigns.”\\n\\nThe Washington Examiner reported Ramirez has refused to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee about her accusation. Ramirez lawyer John Clune tweeted Tuesday that Ramirez wants an FBI investigation, not a congressional investigation, and is willing to “swear to the FBI under penalty of perjury.”\\n\\nA top Judiciary Committee GOP aide told the Examiner in response that the Ramirez legal team “has declined to comply with the committee’s established process and investigation and seem to prefer working through the media.”\\n\\n‘Con game’\\n\\nIn a lengthy press conference Wednesday, President Trump defended Kavanaugh and said there are forces of “evil” at work against his Supreme Court nominee, but he said he wants to hear Ford’s testimony.\\n\\n“This is a very big moment for our country,” Trump said. “Honestly nobody knows who to believe.”\\n\\nHe said the committee is “giving the women a major chance to speak.”\\n\\n“Now it’s possible I’ll hear that and I’ll say, ‘Hey I’m changing my mind. That is possible,’ he said of Thursday’s hearing.\\n\\n“I can be persuaded also,” Trump said.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, President Trump told reporters on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meeting that for Democrats, the nomination process is “a game to them, but it’s a very dangerous game for our country.”\\n\\n“They know it’s a con game, and they are winking at each other,” he said.\\n\\nTrump contended accusers Ford and Ramirez have not presented any substantial evidence.\\n\\nKavanaugh, the president said, is “startled” by the claims, and his wife is “devastated.”\\n\\n“He can’t believe this is happening.”\\n\\nThe couple’s two daughters, Trump said, are also “devastated.”\\n\\n“I don’t mean they’re like, ‘Oh, gee, they’re a little unhappy.’ They’re devastated.”\\n\\nTrump criticized Senate Minority Leader Schumer, D-N.Y., for declaring he believes Ford’s accusation without even talking to her.\\n\\nThe second accuser, Ramirez, “has nothing,” Trump said.\\n\\n“She thinks maybe it could have been him, maybe not. She admits that she was drunk.”\\n\\nRepublicans hope to hold a committee vote on Kavanaugh on Friday and send the nomination to the full Senate, said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, in an interview Tuesday afternoon with the Fox News Channel’s Neil Cavuto.\\n\\nThe earliest a vote of the full Senate could be held, allowing for debate, the senator said, is next Tuesday.\\n\\nKavanaugh: ‘I know I’m telling the truth’\\n\\nFord’s story emerged Sept. 13, a week before the committee was to vote on Kavanaugh’s confirmation, when the ranking member, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, confirmed in response to a news article that she had “information” about an accusation she had been withholding for six weeks against the nominee and said she was turning it over to the FBI. Details of the accusation were leaked over the following weekend to the Washington Post. Ford accuses Kavanaugh of attempting to rape her at a party when both were in high school.\\n\\nKavanaugh has strongly denied Ford’s allegation and the claim of Deborah Ramirez, reported Sunday by the New Yorker, that he exposed himself to her while at Yale University.\\n\\nKavanaugh and his wife, Ashley, spoke to media for the first time about the allegations in an interview with the Fox News Channel’s Martha MacCallum on Monday.\\n\\n“What I know is the truth, and the truth is I’ve never sexually assaulted anyone,” the nominee said.\\n\\nKavanaugh said the allegations would not cause him to withdraw from the confirmation process.\\n\\n“I want a fair process where I can defend my integrity, and I know I’m telling the truth,” he said.\\n\\n“I know my lifelong record and I’m not going to let false accusations drive me out of this process. I have faith in God and I have faith in the fairness of the American people.”\\n\\nRelated columns:\\n\\nTell Mary Jo ‘we believe survivors’ by Jack Cashill\\n\\nPolitical theater: From Kavanaugh to the wall by Erik Rush\\n\\nKavanaugh vs. Ford: The truth may lie in an old fable by James Zumwalt\\n\\nNo more Mr. White Guy by Ann Coulter\\n\\nFord, Ramirez and a woman named Broaddrick by Larry Elder'"
